# Summer Intership project : Development of Intelligent Search Engine

In a six week intership, we wanted to create an intelligent search engine about illnesses. We used HTML, CSS and JS to create the search and results engine pages. We also used python programming Languages and NLP techniques to implement different functionalities to make the search engine a smart one. Our search engine can auto suggest and correct inserted words. We wanted to simplify the searching process helping people to win more time and information.
