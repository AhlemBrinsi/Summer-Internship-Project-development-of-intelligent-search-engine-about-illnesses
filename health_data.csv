"Symptoms of acromegaly include an enlarged face and hands. Changes to the face may cause the brow bone and lower jawbone to protrude, and the nose and lips to get larger. Symptoms of acromegaly include an enlarged face and hands. Changes to the face may cause the brow bone and lower jawbone to protrude, and the nose and lips to get larger. Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that develops when your pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone during adulthood. When you have too much growth hormone, your bones increase in size. In childhood, this leads to increased height and is called gigantism. But in adulthood, a change in height doesn't occur. Instead, the increase in bone size is limited to the bones of your hands, feet and face, and is called acromegaly. Because acromegaly is uncommon and the physical changes occur slowly over many years, the condition sometimes takes a long time to recognize. Untreated, high levels of growth hormone can affect other parts of the body, in addition to your bones. This can lead to serious — sometimes even life-threatening — health problems. But treatment can reduce your risk of complications and significantly improve your symptoms, including the enlargement of your features. A common sign of acromegaly is enlarged hands and feet. For example, you may notice that you aren't able to put on rings that used to fit, and that your shoe size has progressively increased. Acromegaly may also cause gradual changes in your face's shape, such as a protruding lower jaw and brow bone, an enlarged nose, thickened lips, and wider spacing between your teeth. Because acromegaly tends to progress slowly, early signs may not be obvious for years. Sometimes, people notice the physical changes only by comparing old photos with newer ones. Overall, acromegaly signs and symptoms tend to vary from one person to another, and may include any of the following: If you have signs and symptoms associated with acromegaly, contact your doctor for an exam. Acromegaly usually develops slowly. Even your family members may not notice the gradual physical changes that occur with this disorder at first. But early diagnosis is important so that you can start getting proper care. Acromegaly can lead to serious health problems if it's not treated. The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus are in the brain. They control hormone production. The pituitary gland and the hypothalamus are in the brain. They control hormone production. Acromegaly occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone (GH) over a long period of time.  The pituitary gland is a small gland at the base of your brain, behind the bridge of your nose. It produces GH and a number of other hormones. GH plays an important role in managing your physical growth. When the pituitary gland releases GH into your bloodstream, it triggers your liver to produce a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) — sometimes also called insulin-like growth factor-I, or IGF-I. IGF-1 is what causes your bones and other tissues to grow. Too much GH leads to too much IGF-1, which can cause acromegaly signs, symptoms and complications. In adults, a tumor is the most common cause of too much GH production: People who have a rare genetic condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1), have a higher risk of developing acromegaly. In MEN 1, the endocrine glands — usually the parathyroid glands, pancreas and pituitary gland — grow tumors and release extra hormones. Those hormones may trigger acromegaly. If left untreated, acromegaly can lead to major health problems. Complications may include: Early treatment of acromegaly can prevent these complications from developing or becoming worse. Untreated, acromegaly and its complications can lead to premature death.

"Acromegaly is a rare but serious medical condition that happens when you have too much growth hormone in your body. Acromegaly affects your body’s bones and tissues and causes them to grow in irregular ways. The most common treatments for acromegaly include surgery, medication and radiation therapy. Acromegaly (pronounced a-krow-meh-guh-lee) is a rare but serious medical condition that happens when you have high levels of growth hormone (GH) in your body. Your pituitary gland normally produces GH, but tumors on your pituitary or in other parts of your body produce excess GH in acromegaly. Your pituitary gland is a small, pea-sized endocrine gland located at the base of your brain below your hypothalamus. Your pituitary gland releases eight important hormones, including GH. Growth hormone, also known as human growth hormone (hGH) and somatotropin, is a natural hormone that acts on many parts of the body to promote growth in children. Once the growth plates (epiphyses) in your bones have fused, GH no longer increases height, but your body still needs GH. After you’ve finished growing, GH helps to maintain normal bone, cartilage and organ structure and metabolism, including helping to keep your blood glucose (sugar) levels within a healthy range. If you have too much GH in your body as an adult, it can result in irregularly-shaped bones, increased organ size, elevated blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) and other symptoms.

Policy Acromegaly and gigantism are both conditions that result from excess growth hormone (GH). The difference is in who the conditions affect — adults develop acromegaly, whereas children develop gigantism. In children, gigantism occurs when they experience excess GH before the growth plates in their bones fuse (before the end of puberty). This causes them to grow very tall. Gigantism is more rare than acromegaly. Some healthcare providers refer to gigantism as pediatric acromegaly. Once your growth plates have fused, excess GH causes acromegaly. In this case, you don’t grow in height, but the excess GH affects your bones’ shape and your organ size as well as other health factors. Acromegaly can develop at any age after puberty, but healthcare providers most often diagnose it during the fourth and fifth decades of life (middle age). Advertisement Acromegaly is rare. Approximately 3 to 14 of every 100,000 people have been diagnosed with acromegaly. In adults, acromegaly (excess growth hormone) causes bones, cartilage, body organs and other tissues to increase in size. Characteristic changes in appearance include larger hands, feet, ears, lips and nose and a more prominent jaw and forehead. Growth hormone (GH) signals your liver to produce another hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 is the hormone that actually causes your bones and body tissue to grow and also affects how your body processes blood glucose (sugar) and lipids (fats). High levels of GH result in high levels of IFG-1, which can lead to Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart disease. Advertisement The most common cause of acromegaly is a tumor in your pituitary gland called a pituitary adenoma that causes your pituitary gland to release excess growth hormone (GH). Pituitary adenomas (tumors) are almost always benign (noncancerous). Most adenomas that cause acromegaly grow slowly, and you may not notice symptoms of excess GH for many years. Depending on its size and location, the adenoma may press against other pituitary tissue and affect other hormones your pituitary gland makes. If the adenoma is large, it may also press against nearby parts of your brain, causing headaches and vision problems. In adults, acromegaly affects your body’s bones and tissues and causes them to grow in irregular ways. Adults with acromegaly may experience the following symptoms: Other symptoms include: Acromegaly symptoms often start slowly and may be difficult to notice at first. Some people only notice their hands have grown in size when rings they regularly wear feel tight or their shoe size changes, especially the width. If you’re experiencing these symptoms, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider. Symptoms of acromegaly often show up very slowly over many years. This makes it hard to diagnose. Your healthcare provider may recommend you see an endocrinologist, a healthcare provider who specializes in hormone-related conditions. They'll make a diagnosis based on your medical history, a thorough clinical evaluation and specialized tests like blood tests and imaging tests. If you’ve been diagnosed with acromegaly, your provider may order additional tests to see if the condition has affected other parts of your body. These tests may include: There are several treatment options for acromegaly. Your healthcare provider will consider your symptoms and circumstances before offering treatment options that are right for you. The most common treatments for acromegaly are surgery, medication and radiation therapy. In many cases, surgery greatly improves acromegaly symptoms or corrects the condition entirely. Surgeons most often use a type of surgery called transsphenoidal surgery, which involves going through your nose and sphenoid sinus, a hollow space in your skull behind the nasal passages and below your brain, to perform surgery. The specifics of the surgery will depend on the size and location of the tumor. The goal of surgery is to remove all of a tumor that is causing excess growth hormone production. If your surgeon removes enough of the tumor, you may not need further treatment. If your surgeon can remove only a part of a tumor, you may need medication or radiation therapy to manage your symptoms and reduce the production of growth hormone. Your healthcare provider may prescribe one medication or a combination of medications. Medications work in different ways to normalize your body’s growth hormone levels and improve your symptoms. In some cases, a person may take medication until the tumor has shrunk. This can allow a surgeon to then safely remove it. Other people may need to take medication long-term to effectively manage growth hormone levels and symptoms. Acromegaly is curable in some situations but not all. The cure rate for surgical removal of a pituitary tumor that’s causing acromegaly is about 85% for small tumors and 40% to 50% percent for large tumors. Medication can’t cure acromegaly but offers long-term, safe treatment. Unfortunately, there’s nothing you can do to prevent acromegaly. Scientists aren’t sure what causes pituitary tumors that cause acromegaly to develop, though they think certain genetic factors may play a role. The prognosis (outlook) for acromegaly depends on how severe it is and how effectively therapies treat the symptoms. Many people with acromegaly see a significant improvement in symptoms after treatment. If it’s not treated, acromegaly can significantly change your appearance and the shape of your bones. These symptoms can greatly affect your self-image and quality of life. Support groups help some people cope with the challenges they face because of acromegaly. Health complications of acromegaly such as heart disease or Type 2 diabetes can also decrease quality of life and even shorten your lifespan. Because of this, it’s important to contact your healthcare provider if you’re experiencing symptoms and to adhere to your treatment plan if you’ve been diagnosed. If left untreated, acromegaly can cause the following complications: Life expectancy for someone with acromegaly depends on the severity of the condition and if they have other health conditions, usually due to untreated acromegaly. If your growth hormone levels aren’t properly managed and you have other conditions like heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, your life expectancy may reduce by approximately 10 years. If you have acromegaly that’s properly treated and have normal growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, you’ll likely have a normal life expectancy. If you’re experiencing symptoms of acromegaly, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider. If you’ve been diagnosed with acromegaly, you’ll need to see your provider regularly to make sure your treatment is working well. A note from Cleveland Clinic Acromegaly is a rare but serious condition. The good news is that it’s treatable with surgery, medication and/or radiation therapy. If you’ve noticed an increase in size in your hands, feet and/or facial features, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider. They can order some simple tests to see if your growth hormone levels are the cause of your symptoms. Last reviewed on 06/20/2022. Learn more about our editorial process.

 Acromegaly is a disorder that results in excess growth of certain parts of the human body. It is caused by excess growth hormone (GH) after the growth plates have closed. The initial symptom is typically enlargement of the hands and feet.[3] There may also be an enlargement of the forehead, jaw, and nose. Other symptoms may include joint pain, thicker skin, deepening of the voice, headaches, and problems with vision.[3] Complications of the disease may include type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure.[3]
 Acromegaly is usually caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone. In more than 95% of cases the excess production is due to a benign tumor, known as a pituitary adenoma. The condition is not inherited. Acromegaly is rarely due to a tumor in another part of the body. Diagnosis is by measuring growth hormone after a person has consumed a glucose solution, or by measuring insulin-like growth factor I in the blood. After diagnosis, medical imaging of the pituitary is carried out to determine if an adenoma is present. If excess growth hormone is produced during childhood, the result is the condition gigantism rather than acromegaly, and it is characterized by excessive height.[3]
 Treatment options include surgery to remove the tumor, medications, and radiation therapy. Surgery is usually the preferred treatment; the smaller the tumor, the more likely surgery will be curative. If surgery is contraindicated or not curative, somatostatin analogues or GH receptor antagonists may be used. Radiation therapy may be used if neither surgery nor medications are completely effective.[3] Without treatment, life expectancy is reduced by 10 years; with treatment, life expectancy is not reduced.[6]
 Acromegaly affects about 3 per 50,000 people. It is most commonly diagnosed in middle age.[3] Males and females are affected with equal frequency.[7] It was first described in the medical literature by Nicolas Saucerotte in 1772.[8][9] The term is from the Greek ἄκρον (akron) meaning ""extremity"", and μέγα (mega) meaning ""large"".[3]
 Features that may result from a high level of GH or expanding tumor include:[citation needed]
 About 98% of cases of acromegaly are due to the overproduction of growth hormone by a benign tumor of the pituitary gland called an adenoma.[17] These tumors produce excessive growth hormone and compress surrounding brain tissues as they grow larger. In some cases, they may compress the optic nerves. Expansion of the tumor may cause headaches and visual disturbances. In addition, compression of the surrounding normal pituitary tissue can alter production of other hormones, leading to changes in menstruation and breast discharge in women and impotence in men because of reduced testosterone production.[18]
 A marked variation in rates of GH production and the aggressiveness of the tumor occurs. Some adenomas grow slowly and symptoms of GH excess are often not noticed for many years. Other adenomas grow rapidly and invade surrounding brain areas or the sinuses, which are located near the pituitary. In general, younger people tend to have more aggressive tumors.[19]
 Most pituitary tumors arise spontaneously and are not genetically inherited. Many pituitary tumors arise from a genetic alteration in a single pituitary cell that leads to increased cell division and tumor formation. This genetic change, or mutation, is not present at birth but is acquired during life. The mutation occurs in a gene that regulates the transmission of chemical signals within pituitary cells; it permanently switches on the signal that tells the cell to divide and secrete growth hormones. The events within the cell that cause disordered pituitary cell growth and GH oversecretion currently are the subject of intensive research.[19]
 Pituitary adenomas and diffuse somatomammotroph hyperplasia may result from somatic mutations activating GNAS, which may be acquired or associated with McCune–Albright syndrome.[20][21]
 In a few people, acromegaly is caused not by pituitary tumors, but by tumors of the pancreas, lungs, and adrenal glands. These tumors also lead to an excess of GH, either because they produce GH themselves or, more frequently, because they produce GHRH (growth hormone-releasing hormone), the hormone that stimulates the pituitary to make GH. In these people, the excess GHRH can be measured in the blood and establishes that the cause of the acromegaly is not due to a pituitary defect. When these nonpituitary tumors are surgically removed, GH levels fall and the symptoms of acromegaly improve.[citation needed]
 In people with GHRH-producing, non-pituitary tumors, the pituitary still may be enlarged and may be mistaken for a tumor. Therefore, it is important that physicians carefully analyze all ""pituitary tumors"" removed from people with acromegaly so as to not overlook the possibility that a tumor elsewhere in the body is causing the disorder.[citation needed]
 If acromegaly is suspected, medical laboratory investigations followed by medical imaging, if the lab tests are positive, confirms or rules out the presence of this condition.[citation needed]
 IGF1 provides the most sensitive lab test for the diagnosis of acromegaly, and a GH suppression test following an oral glucose load, which is a very specific lab test, will confirm the diagnosis following a positive screening test for IGF1. A single value of the GH is not useful in view of its pulsatility (levels in the blood vary greatly even in healthy individuals).  GH levels taken 2 hours after a 75- or 100-gram glucose tolerance test are helpful in the diagnosis: GH levels are suppressed below 1 μg/L in normal people, and levels higher than this cutoff are confirmatory of acromegaly.[citation needed]
 Other pituitary hormones must be assessed to address the secretory effects of the tumor, as well as the mass effect of the tumor on the normal pituitary gland. They include thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), gonadotropic hormones (FSH, LH), adrenocorticotropic hormone, and prolactin.[citation needed]
 An MRI of the brain focusing on the sella turcica after gadolinium administration allows for clear delineation of the pituitary and the hypothalamus and the location of the tumor. A number of other overgrowth syndromes can result in similar problems.[citation needed]
 Pseudoacromegaly is a condition with the usual acromegaloid features, but without an increase in growth hormone and IGF-1. It is frequently associated with insulin resistance.[22] Cases have been reported due to minoxidil at an unusually high dose.[23] It can also be caused by a selective post receptor defect of insulin signalling, leading to the impairment of metabolic, but preservation of mitogenic, signalling.[24]
 The goals of treatment are to reduce GH production to normal levels thereby reversing or ameliorating the signs and symptoms of acromegaly, to relieve the pressure that the growing pituitary tumor exerts on the surrounding brain areas, and to preserve normal pituitary function. Currently, treatment options include surgical removal of the tumor, drug therapy, and radiation therapy of the pituitary.[citation needed]
 The primary current medical treatment of acromegaly is to use somatostatin analogues – octreotide (Sandostatin) or lanreotide (Somatuline).
These somatostatin analogues are synthetic forms of a brain hormone, somatostatin, which stops GH production. The long-acting forms of these drugs must be injected every 2 to 4 weeks for effective treatment. Most people with acromegaly respond to this medication. In many people with acromegaly, GH levels fall within one hour and headaches improve within minutes after the injection. Octreotide and lanreotide are effective for long-term treatment. Octreotide and lanreotide have also been used successfully to treat people with acromegaly caused by non-pituitary tumors.[citation needed]
 Somatostatin analogues are also sometimes used to shrink large tumors before surgery.[25]
 Because octreotide inhibits gastrointestinal and pancreatic function, long-term use causes digestive problems such as loose stools, nausea, and gas in one third of people. In addition, approximately 25 percent of people with acromegaly develop gallstones, which are usually asymptomatic.[26] In some cases, octreotide treatment can cause diabetes due to the fact that somatostatin and its analogues can inhibit the release of insulin.[citation needed] With an aggressive adenoma that is not able to be operated on, there may be a resistance to octreotide and in which case a second generation SSA, pasireotide, may be used for tumor control. However, insulin and glucose levels should be carefully monitored as pasireotide has been associated with hyperglycemia by reducing insulin secretion.[27]
 For those who are unresponsive to somatostatin analogues, or for whom they are otherwise contraindicated, it is possible to treat using one of the dopamine agonists, bromocriptine or cabergoline. As tablets rather than injections, they cost considerably less. These drugs can also be used as an adjunct to somatostatin analogue therapy. They are most effective in those whose pituitary tumours cosecrete prolactin. Side effects of these dopamine agonists include gastrointestinal upset, nausea, vomiting, light-headedness when standing, and nasal congestion. These side effects can be reduced or eliminated if medication is started at a very low dose at bedtime, taken with food, and gradually increased to the full therapeutic dose. Bromocriptine lowers GH and IGF-1 levels and reduces tumor size in fewer than half of people with acromegaly. Some people report improvement in their symptoms although their GH and IGF-1 levels still are elevated.[citation needed]
 The latest development in the medical treatment of acromegaly is the use of growth hormone receptor antagonists. The only available member of this family is pegvisomant (Somavert). By blocking the action of the endogenous growth hormone molecules, this compound is able to control the disease activity of acromegaly in virtually everyone with acromegaly. Pegvisomant has to be administered subcutaneously by daily injections. Combinations of long-acting somatostatin analogues and weekly injections of pegvisomant seem to be equally effective as daily injections of pegvisomant.[citation needed]
 Surgical removal of the pituitary tumor is usually effective in lowering growth hormone levels. Two surgical procedures are available for use. The first is endonasal transsphenoidal surgery, which involves the surgeon reaching the pituitary through an incision in the nasal cavity wall. The wall is reached by passing through the nostrils with microsurgical instruments. The second method is transsphenoidal surgery during which an incision is made into the gum beneath the upper lip. Further incisions are made to cut through the septum to reach the nasal cavity, where the pituitary is located. Endonasal transsphenoidal surgery is a less invasive procedure with a shorter recovery time than the older method of transsphenoidal surgery, and the likelihood of removing the entire tumor is greater with reduced side effects. Consequently, endonasal transsphenoidal surgery is the more common surgical choice.[citation needed]
 These procedures normally relieve the pressure on the surrounding brain regions and lead to a lowering of GH levels. Surgery is most successful in people with blood GH levels below 40 ng/ml before the operation and with pituitary tumors no larger than 10 mm in diameter. Success depends on the skill and experience of the surgeon. The success rate also depends on what level of GH is defined as a cure. The best measure of surgical success is the normalization of GH and IGF-1 levels. Ideally, GH should be less than 2 ng/ml after an oral glucose load. A review of GH levels in 1,360 people worldwide immediately after surgery revealed that 60% had random GH levels below 5 ng/ml. Complications of surgery may include cerebrospinal fluid leaks, meningitis, or damage to the surrounding normal pituitary tissue, requiring lifelong pituitary hormone replacement.[citation needed]
 Even when surgery is successful and hormone levels return to normal, people must be carefully monitored for years for possible recurrence. More commonly, hormone levels may improve, but not return completely to normal. These people may then require additional treatment, usually with medications.[citation needed]
 Radiation therapy has been used both as a primary treatment and combined with surgery or drugs. It is usually reserved for people who have tumor remaining after surgery. These people often also receive medication to lower GH levels. Radiation therapy is given in divided doses over four to six weeks. This treatment lowers GH levels by about 50 percent over 2 to 5 years. People monitored for more than 5 years show significant further improvement. Radiation therapy causes a gradual loss of production of other pituitary hormones with time. Loss of vision and brain injury, which have been reported, are very rare complications of radiation treatments.[citation needed]
 The initial treatment chosen should be individualized depending on the person's characteristics, such as age and tumor size. If the tumor has not yet invaded surrounding brain tissues, removal of the pituitary adenoma by an experienced neurosurgeon is usually the first choice. After surgery, a person must be monitored long-term for increasing GH levels.[citation needed]
 If surgery does not normalize hormone levels or a relapse occurs, a doctor will usually begin additional drug therapy. The current first choice is generally octreotide or lanreotide; however, bromocriptine and cabergoline are both cheaper and easier to administer. With all of these medications, long-term therapy is necessary, because their withdrawal can lead to rising GH levels and tumor re-expansion. [citation needed]
 Radiation therapy is generally used for people whose tumors are not completely removed by surgery, for people who are not good candidates for surgery because of other health problems, and for people who do not respond adequately to surgery and medication.[citation needed]
 Life expectancy of people with acromegaly is dependent on how early the disease is detected.[28] Life expectancy after the successful treatment of early disease is equal to that of the general population.[29] Acromegaly can often go on for years before diagnosis, resulting in poorer outcome, and it is suggested that the better the growth hormone is controlled, the better the outcome.[28] Upon successful surgical treatment, headaches and visual symptoms tend to resolve.[12] One exception is sleep apnea, which is present in around 70% of cases but does not tend to resolve with successful treatment of growth hormone level.[11] While hypertension is a complication of 40% of cases, it typically responds well to regular regimens of blood pressure medication.[11] Diabetes that occurs with acromegaly is treated with the typical medications, but successful lowering of growth hormone levels often alleviates symptoms of diabetes.[11] Hypogonadism without gonad destruction is reversible with treatment.[11] Acromegaly is associated with a slightly elevated risk of cancer.[30]

 Acromegaly is a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone, causing body tissues and bones to grow more quickly. Over time, this leads to abnormally large hands and feet, and a wide range of other symptoms. Acromegaly is usually diagnosed in adults aged 30 to 50, but it can affect people of any age. When it develops before the end of puberty, it's known as ""gigantism"". Acromegaly can cause a wide range of symptoms, which tend to develop very slowly over time. Early symptoms include: Children and teenagers will be abnormally tall. As time goes on, common symptoms include: Symptoms often become more noticeable as you get older. See a GP straight away if you think you have acromegaly. Acromegaly can usually be successfully treated, but early diagnosis and treatment is important to prevent the symptoms getting worse and reduce the chance of complications. If you do not get treatment, you may be at risk of developing: Because of the risk of bowel polyps, a procedure known as a colonoscopy might be recommended if you've been diagnosed with acromegaly. Regular colonoscopy screening may also be necessary. Acromegaly happens because your pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland just below the brain) produces too much growth hormone. This is usually caused by a non-cancerous tumour in the pituitary gland called an adenoma. Most of the symptoms of acromegaly are due to the excess of growth hormone itself, but some come from the tumour pressing on nearby tissues. For example, you may get headaches and vision problems if a tumour pushes against the nearby nerves. Acromegaly sometimes runs in families, but most of the time it's not inherited. Adenomas usually spontaneously develop because of a genetic change in a cell of the pituitary gland. This change causes uncontrolled growth of the affected cells, creating the tumour. Rarely, acromegaly is caused by a tumour in another part of the body, such as the lungs, pancreas or another part of the brain. It may also be linked to some genetic conditions. Treatment for acromegaly depends on your symptoms. Usually the goal is to: Most people with acromegaly have surgery to remove a pituitary tumour. Medicine or radiotherapy may sometimes be needed after, or instead of, surgery. Surgery is usually effective and can completely cure acromegaly. But sometimes the tumour is too large to be removed entirely, and you may need another operation or further treatment with medicine or radiotherapy. Under general anaesthetic, the surgeon will make a small cut inside your nose or behind your upper lip to access the pituitary gland. A long, thin, flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end, called an endoscope, is fed into the opening so your doctor can see the tumour. Surgical instruments are passed through the same opening and used to remove the tumour. Removing the tumour should instantly lower your levels of growth hormone and relieve pressure on the surrounding tissue. Facial features often start to return to normal and swelling improves within a few days. With surgery, there's risk of: Your surgeon will discuss these risks with you and answer any questions you have. Medicine may be prescribed if your growth hormone levels are still higher than normal after surgery, or if surgery was not possible. 3 different types of medicine are used: Each of these medicines has different advantages and disadvantages. Speak to your doctor about the options available to you, and the benefits and risks of each. If surgery is not possible, or not all of the tumour could be removed, or if medicine has not worked, you may be offered radiotherapy. This can eventually reduce your growth hormone levels, but it may not have a noticeable effect for several years and you may need to take medicine in the meantime. 2 main types of radiotherapy are used to treat acromegaly: Stereotactic radiotherapy is more commonly used to treat adenomas because it minimises the risk of damage to nearby healthy tissue. Radiotherapy can have a number of side effects. It will often cause a gradual drop in the levels of other hormones produced by your pituitary gland, so you'll usually need hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life. It may also have an effect on your fertility. Your doctor will be able to talk to you about these risks and other possible side effects. Treatment is often effective at stopping the excessive production of growth hormone and improving the symptoms of acromegaly. After treatment, you'll need regular follow-up appointments with your specialist for the rest of your life. These will be used to monitor how well your pituitary gland is working, check you're on the correct hormone replacement treatment and make sure the condition does not return. Because the symptoms of acromegaly often develop gradually over several years, you may not get a diagnosis straight away. Your doctor may ask you to bring in photographs of yourself that span the past few years to look for the tell-tale gradual changes. If your doctor suspects you have acromegaly, you'll need to have a blood test to measure your growth hormone levels. To make sure the blood test gives an accurate result, you may be asked to drink a sugary solution before having a series of blood samples taken. For people without acromegaly, drinking the solution should stop growth hormone being released. In people with acromegaly, the level of growth hormone in the blood will remain high. This is called a glucose tolerance test. Your doctor will also measure the level of another hormone, called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). A higher level of IGF-1 is a very accurate indication that you may have acromegaly. If your blood tests show a high level of growth hormone and IGF-1, you might have an MRI scan of your brain. This will show where the adenoma is in your pituitary gland and how big it is. If you cannot have an MRI scan, a CT scan can be carried out, but this is less accurate. If you have acromegaly, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to treat and prevent acromegaly. You can opt out of the register at any time.

"Acromegaly is a rare condition that results from excessive growth hormone in the body. It is usually due to a pituitary gland tumor, known as a pituitary adenoma. Growth hormone (GH) is normally produced by the pituitary gland in the brain. Excessive amounts can result if a tumor develops in the gland. Acromegaly affects muscle strength, bone health, and energy levels, and it can lead to unusual physical features and medical complications. It can take years for the changes to appear. Premature death is possible, and life expectancy may be reduced by 10 years.  Three to four people in every million receive a diagnosis of acromegaly in the United States (U.S.) each year, and it affects 60 people  in every million at any one time. The changes brought about by acromegaly take time to develop. Changes in physical appearance can be dramatic. They include: Other changes include: There may also be enlargement of the internal organs, including the heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys. Acromegaly is very rare in children. It can lead to a condition called gigantism. The overproduction of growth hormone that is associated with acromegaly normally results from a tumor. The most common type of tumor is a non-cancerous, or benign, tumor in the pituitary gland, known as a pituitary adenoma. The tumor causes the pituitary gland to produce excess growth hormone (GH), leading to abnormal growth. Pituitary tumors are not genetically inherited from parents. They can appear randomly, due to a small genetic change of one cell within the gland. Over time, this cell will replicate and form a tumor, called an adenoma. Adenomas are not malignant, because they do not spread to other parts of the body, but they may cause problems due to their size and location. As the tumor grows, it can put pressure on surrounding brain tissue. Because the skull is a closed space, this growth can crowd the remaining tissue, leading to headaches and vision problems. The location of the tumor means that the production of other hormones can also be affected. The impact can be different for men and women, due to the type of hormone affected. Women may find that it affects their menstrual cycle, while some men experience impotence. Around 17 percent of the population are thought to have small pituitary adenomas that do not usually produce excess growth hormone or cause any symptoms. It is only when a larger tumor occurs that the problems arise.  It is also important to note that most pituitary adenomas do not secrete any hormone. However, of the ones that do, growth hormone-secreting adenomas account for a third of cases. In rare cases, a tumor elsewhere in the body, such as the lungs, adrenal glands, or pancreas, can lead to an overproduction of GH, resulting in symptoms of acromegaly. This growth hormone may either be produced by the tumors themselves or because the pituitary gland is responding to a stimulus to produce GH. For example, some hypothalamic tumors may secrete growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), which tells the body to produce GH. Sometimes, acromegaly is due to increased growth hormone production from outside the pituitary gland, such as from neuroendocrine tumors like small cell lung cancer or carcinoid tumors. As the symptoms of acromegaly appear slowly, it can take a long time, possibly years, to make a diagnosis. If the hands and feet swell and grow to a larger size, this can be an early sign of acromegaly. Often, people will notice it when their gloves or shoes no longer fit. A series of tests can confirm the presence of acromegaly. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1): Tests can show if the level is too high. IGF-1 is a hormone that is produced in the liver. It promotes growth. People with acromegaly usually have high levels of this hormone, because high levels of GH stimulate the production of IGF-1. Other pituitary hormones can also be measured. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): This can give a more accurate reading of GH levels. The patient will need to fast overnight before drinking some concentrated glucose solution, and then giving a blood sample. Ingesting the glucose would normally lead to a fall in hormone levels. In a person with acromegaly, the hormone levels would remain high, because the body is producing excess GH. MRI scan of the brain: This can determine the location and size of the tumor. Treatment will depend on the location of the tumor, the person’s age, and their medical history. Treatment will aim to reduce excess hormone production, relieve any pressure caused by the tumor, regulate hormone levels, and improve symptoms. Surgery may be carried out to remove the pituitary tumor. This would stop the overproduction of GH and relieve pressure on the surrounding tissue. Transsphenoidal surgery involves inserting an endoscope through the nasal cavity to access the pituitary gland. The endoscope will pass from the nasal cavity into the sphenoid bone, which is a bone separating the brain from the rest of the facial structures. Removing the tumor should lead to a fall in growth hormone levels. However, even if the tumor is successfully removed, hormone levels may not return to normal, and additional therapies may be necessary. Radiation therapy can be used alone or as part of a combined approach. After surgery, radiation therapy can remove any remaining tumor cells. It can also be used in conjunction with medication to reduce growth hormone levels. Conventional radiation therapy is given 5 days a week, for up to 6 weeks, but it may take up to 10 years for growth hormone levels to return to normal. In stereotactic radiosurgery, highly-focused, intense beams of radiation are directed at the tumor, minimizing damage to the surrounding tissue. This involves fewer sessions than conventional radiotherapy, and it can reduce growth hormone levels in a shorter time. Acromegaly can be treated with medication alone if surgery is considered too risky or impossible due to the location of the tumor. Medications include somatostatin analogs (SSAs), dopamine agonists, and growth hormone receptor antagonists (GHRAs). These aim to stop the rapid growth triggered by preventing the secretion of or the action of growth hormone. A combination of treatments will probably be the best option. Complications can be potentially life-threatening. They include: If not treated, acromegaly can have a serious effect on a person’s health.

" What Is Acromegaly? Acromegaly is a rare hormonal condition that results from an excess amount of growth hormone (GH) in the body. The extra amount of GH causes excess growth in the bones and soft tissues of the body. Children with the condition can grow to abnormal heights. They may also have an exaggerated bone structure. Acromegaly mostly affects the arms, legs, and face. The symptoms of acromegaly can be difficult to detect since they usually develop slowly over time. For example, you may notice over a period of several months that you have a ring that feels increasingly tight on your finger and one day it no longer fits. You may also find that you need to go up a size in shoes if you have this condition. Common symptoms of acromegaly are:  You should see your doctor if you’ve noticed one or more of these symptoms. GH is part of a group of hormones that regulate the growth and development of the body. People with acromegaly have too much GH. It accelerates bone growth and organ enlargement. Because of this growth stimulation, the bones and organs of people with acromegaly are much larger than other people’s bones and organs. GH is made in the brain’s pituitary gland. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), more than 95 percent of people with acromegaly have a benign tumor affecting their pituitary. This tumor is called an adenoma. Adenomas are common. They affect about 17 percent of people. In most people, these tumors don’t cause excess GH, but when they do can result in acromegaly. Acromegaly can start any time after puberty. However, it occurs more often in middle age. People aren’t always aware of their condition. Changes to the body may take place slowly over the course of many years. Many people with acromegaly don’t know they have the condition because the onset of symptoms is usually slow. However, if your doctor suspects you have acromegaly, they can test you for it. Acromegaly is most often diagnosed in middle-aged adults, but the symptoms may appear at any age. Blood tests can determine if you have too much GH, but these aren’t always accurate because GH levels fluctuate throughout the day. Instead, your doctor may order a glucose tolerance test. This test requires you to drink 75 to 100 grams of glucose and then have your GH levels tested. If your body is secreting normal levels of GH, excess glucose will cause your body to suppress your GH levels. People who have acromegaly will still show high GH levels.  Doctors may also test for a protein called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Levels of IGF-1 can show if there is abnormal growth in the body. IGF-1 testing can also be used to monitor the progress of other hormone treatments. X-rays and MRI scans may be ordered to check for excess bone growth if your doctor suspects you have acromegaly. Your doctor will also perform a physical exam, and they may order a sonogram to check the size of internal organs. After you’re diagnosed with acromegaly, your doctor can use MRI and CT scans to help them find the pituitary tumor and determine its size. If they don’t find a tumor on the pituitary gland, your doctor will look for tumors in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis that may be causing excess GH production.  The NIH estimates that three to four out of every 1 million people develop acromegaly every year and that 60 out of every 1 million people have the condition at any given time. However, since the condition often goes undiagnosed, the total number of affected individuals is probably underestimated.  Treatment for acromegaly is based on your age and overall health. The goals of treatment are to: Several types of treatments may be needed. Surgery to remove the tumor causing excess GH is the first option doctors usually recommend to people with acromegaly. Usually, this treatment is quick and effective in reducing GH levels, which can improve symptoms. One possible complication is damage to the pituitary tissues that surrounded the tumor. If this happens, it can mean you’ll need to start a lifelong pituitary hormone replacement treatment. Rare but serious complications include cerebrospinal fluid leaks and meningitis. Medication is another treatment option that’s often used if surgery isn’t successful in reducing GH levels, and it can also be used to shrink large tumors before surgery. These types of medications are used to regulate or block GH production: Radiation may be used to destroy large tumors or sections of tumor left after surgery or when medications alone aren’t effective. Radiation can slowly help to lower GH levels when used along with medication. A dramatic decrease in GH levels using this type of treatment may take several years, with radiation administered in multiple four- to six-week sessions. Radiation can impair your fertility. In rare cases, it can lead to vision loss, brain injury, or secondary tumors.  If it’s left untreated, acromegaly can cause serious health problems. It can even become life-threatening. Some common complications include: The outlook for people with acromegaly is usually positive if the condition is discovered in the early stages. Surgery to remove pituitary tumors is usually successful. Treatment may also help keep acromegaly from having long-term effects.

"Acromegaly is caused by an excess of growth hormone. The most obvious signs of acromegaly arise from the overgrowth of bones in the face, hands and feet causing facial disfigurement, large hands and feet. However, the changes occur so slowly that they go unnoticed for a long time.
Acromegaly develops after the person has reached adulthood. In children, the same condition causes extreme tall stature (gigantism). People aged between 30 and 50 years are most commonly affected. About 1,000 people in Australia are estimated to have acromegaly.
A non-cancerous (benign) tumour on the pituitary gland is the most common cause. The pituitary gland, located in the brain, produces a number of hormones including growth hormone. Growth hormone promotes growth in childhood and in an adult, it controls metabolism, muscle and bone mass. Excessive amounts of growth hormone stimulate the growth of all body tissues. This effect is mediated by a growth factor called IGF-I, which is produced in the liver. The symptoms and signs of acromegaly can include: 
Without medical treatment, acromegaly can cause a range of complications including: 
A pituitary tumour (adenoma) is the commonest cause of acromegaly. The adenoma secretes excessive amounts of growth hormone, which affects many tissues of the body, including the bones and skin. The hormone imbalance usually causes disturbances in other hormonal systems. For example, too much growth hormone can cause diabetes, which occurs in up to one quarter of people with the condition. Affected women can have menstrual cycle irregularities.
The adenoma slowly enlarges and may press against the surrounding tissue, causing headaches. If the nerves to the eyes are compressed, this can cause vision impairment.
Certain tumours in other organs, such as the lungs or pancreas, can very rarely cause acromegaly. These tumours either make growth hormone or make a chemical called growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) that prompts the pituitary gland to make growth hormone. 
The progression of acromegaly depends on the secretion activity and size of the tumour. In general, acromegaly progresses faster and more aggressively in people who develop a pituitary tumour early in adult life. The cause of pituitary tumours is unknown. Without a known cause, it is impossible to predict or prevent acromegaly. Acromegaly is difficult to diagnose in its early stages, because the physical changes occur over many years. Following a suspicion of acromegaly based on history and physical examination, blood tests are required for confirmation of diagnosis. 
Treatment reduces the swelling of the soft tissue in the face, hands and feet but cannot reverse the effects on the bones. Treatment is aimed at removing the pituitary tumour, or reducing its activity. Options may include: The doctor may choose one or more treatments depending on the circumstances and indications. A person with acromegaly should have regular medical tests to monitor the condition. Tests may include an annual medical check-up and blood tests to measure growth hormone status.

"Acromegaly is a rare but serious condition caused by too much growth hormone (GH) in the blood. Acromegaly in adults occurs mainly in middle-aged men and women. Acromegaly is usually caused by a non-cancerous tumor in the pituitary gland called a pituitary adenoma. The tumor produces too much GH and raises the level of GH in the blood. Too much GH also raises the level of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hormone produced in the liver that also promotes growth. Acromegaly is rarely caused by hormone-producing tumors in other parts of the body. Growth hormone (GH) is released into the bloodstream by the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. Blood carries GH to other parts of the body where it has specific effects. In children, GH stimulates growth and development. In adults, GH affects energy levels, muscle strength, bone health, and one's sense of well-being. Too much GH in children is called gigantism and is extremely rare.  

GH helps children grow taller (also called linear growth), increases muscle mass, and decreases body fat. In both children and adults, GH also helps control the body’s metabolism—the process by which cells change food into energy and make other substances that the body needs. Growth hormone deficiency (too little GH) and some other health problems can be treated with synthetic (manufactured) GH. Sometimes GH is used illegally for non-medical purposes. 

GH is available only by prescription and is injected. Synthetic GH seems to be safe and effective when used as prescribed for the FDA-approved conditions. 

In children, GH is used to treat:  In adults, GH is used to treat:  If acromegaly is suspected, an endocrinologist will recommend a blood test to check the level of IGF-1. High IGF-1 levels can mean that the levels of GH are also high. Another way to diagnose acromegaly is with an oral glucose tolerance test. In this test, GH levels in the blood are measured after you drink sugar water. Normally, the sugar water will make the pituitary gland stop producing GH and blood levels drop. However, a GH-producing pituitary tumor will not stop making GH, so the levels of GH in the blood will not change significantly. A person with acromegaly usually has large hands and feet, thick lips, coarse facial features, a jutting forehead and jaw, and widely spaced teeth. Often people with acromegaly sweat a lot. 

Other signs and symptoms fall into three categories, depending on the underlying causes. Symptoms can be caused by high GH levels, hypopituitarism (pituitary hormone deficiency caused by tumor damage to the pituitary), or by tumor volume effects (when the tumor is large enough to compress surrounding brain structures). 

Caused by high GH levels:  Caused by hypopituitarism:  Caused by tumor volume:    Acromegaly requires expert care. Too much GH and IGF-1 in the blood lower both your quality of life and how long you might live. The main goal of treatment is to lower GH and IGF-1 levels to normal. Treatment may be surgery, radiation therapy, medication, or a combination of these options. 

If the cause of acromegaly is a pituitary tumor, surgery to remove the tumor is the first treatment. Complete removal of some tumors is difficult and other types of therapy are often needed to reach normal GH and IGF-1 levels. If your GH level isn't normal after surgery, or if you aren't a candidate for surgery, then radiation therapy and medication are also options. Radiation therapy can take a long time to bring GH levels down to normal. Medication may be needed until the radiation therapy takes effect. 

Drugs are also available to treat acromegaly, but they are not a cure. If surgery or radiation does not lower your GH levels, you'll probably need to continue medications. The most effective medications for acromegaly are somatostatin analogs and a GH receptor antagonist. Another type of medication (dopamine agonists) works for some but not most patients. Some patients may benefit from a combination of these medicines.  Endocrine Library >> Endocrine Society.""Thyroid Cancer | Endocrine Society.""

"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) occurs at the most advanced stage of infection. HIV targets the body’s white blood cells, weakening the immune system. This makes it easier to get sick with diseases like tuberculosis, infections and some cancers. HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It is not spread by kisses, hugs or sharing food. It can also spread from a mother to her baby. HIV can be prevented and treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Untreated HIV can progress to AIDS, often after many years. WHO now defines Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) as CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm3 or WHO stage 3 or 4 in adults and adolescents. All children younger than 5 years of age living with HIV are considered to have advanced HIV disease. The symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection. HIV spreads more easily in the first few months after a person is infected, but many are unaware of their status until the later stages. In the first few weeks after being infected people may not experience symptoms. Others may have an influenza-like illness including: The infection progressively weakens the immune system. This can cause other signs and symptoms: Without treatment, people living with HIV infection can also develop severe illnesses: HIV causes other infections to get worse, such as hepatitis C, hepatitis B and mpox. HIV can be transmitted via the exchange of body fluids from people living with HIV, including blood, breast milk, semen, and vaginal secretions. HIV can also be transmitted to a child during pregnancy and delivery.  People cannot become infected with HIV through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water. People living with HIV who are taking ART and have an undetectable viral load will not transmit HIV to their sexual partners. Early access to ART and support to remain on treatment is therefore critical not only to improve the health of people living with HIV but also to prevent HIV transmission. Behaviours and conditions that put people at greater risk of contracting HIV include: HIV can be diagnosed through rapid diagnostic tests that provide same-day results. This greatly facilitates early diagnosis and linkage with treatment and prevention. People can also use HIV self-tests to test themselves. However, no single test can provide a full HIV positive diagnosis; confirmatory testing is required, conducted by a qualified and trained health worker or community worker. HIV infection can be detected with great accuracy using WHO prequalified tests within a nationally approved testing strategy and algorithm. Most widely used HIV diagnostic tests detect antibodies produced by a person as part of their immune response to fight HIV. In most cases, people develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of infection. During this time, people are in the so-called “window period” when they have low levels of antibodies which cannot be detected by many rapid tests, but they may still transmit HIV to others. People who have had a recent high-risk exposure and test negative can have a further test after 28 days. Following a positive diagnosis, people should be retested before they are enrolled in treatment and care to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. While testing for adolescents and adults has been made simple and efficient, this is not the case for babies born to HIV-positive mothers. For children less than 18 months of age, rapid antibody testing is not sufficient to identify HIV infection – virological testing must be provided as early as birth or at 6 weeks of age. New technologies are now available to perform this test at the point of care and enable same-day results, which will accelerate appropriate linkage with treatment and care. HIV is a preventable disease.  Reduce the risk of HIV infection by: Doctors may suggest medicines and medical devices to help prevent HIV infection, including: ARVs can also be used to prevent mothers from passing HIV to their children. People taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who have no evidence of virus in the blood will not pass HIV to their sexual partners. Access to testing and ART is an important part of preventing HIV. When given before possible exposures to HIV it is called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and when given after an exposure it is called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).  People can use PrEP or PEP when the risk of contracting HIV is high; people should seek advice from a clinician when thinking about using PrEP or PEP. There is no cure for HIV infection. It is treated with antiretroviral drugs, which stop the virus from replicating in the body. Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not cure HIV infection but allows a person’s immune system to get stronger. This helps them to fight other infections. Currently, ART must be taken every day for the rest of a person’s life. ART lowers the amount of the virus in a person’s body. This stops symptoms and allows people to live full and healthy lives. People living with HIV who are taking ART and who have no evidence of virus in the blood will not spread the virus to their sexual partners. Pregnant women with HIV should have access to, and take, ART as soon as possible. This protects the health of the mother and will help prevent HIV transmission to the fetus before birth, or through breast milk. Advanced HIV disease remains a persistent problem in the HIV response. WHO is supporting countries to implement the advanced HIV disease package of care to reduce illness and death. Newer HIV medicines and short course treatments for opportunistic infections like cryptococcal meningitis are being developed that may change the way people take ART and prevention medicines, including access to injectable formulations, in the future.

 The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)[9][10][11] is a retrovirus[12] that attacks the immune system. It can be managed with treatment. Without treatment it can lead to a spectrum of conditions including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).[5]
 Effective treatment for HIV-positive people (people living with HIV) involves a life-long regimen of medicine to suppress the virus, making the viral load undetectable. There is no vaccine or cure for HIV. An HIV-positive person on treatment can expect to live a normal life, and die with the virus, not of it.[5][6]
 Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made.[13]
 An HIV-positive person who has an undetectable viral load as a result of long-term treatment has effectively no risk of transmitting HIV sexually.[14][15] Campaigns by UNAIDS and organizations around the world have communicated this as Undetectable = Untransmittable.[16]
 Without treatment the infection can interfere with the immune system, and eventually progress to AIDS, sometimes taking many years. Following initial infection an individual may not notice any symptoms, or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness.[4] During this period the person may not know that they are HIV-positive, yet they will be able to pass on the virus. Typically, this period is followed by a prolonged incubation period with no symptoms.[5] Eventually the HIV infection increases the risk of developing other infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors which are rare in people who have normal immune function.[4] The late stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss.[5] Without treatment a person living with HIV can expect to live for 11 years.[7] Early testing can show if treatment is needed to stop this progression and to prevent infecting others.
 HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex (including anal and vaginal sex), contaminated hypodermic needles or blood transfusions, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.[17] Some bodily fluids, such as saliva, sweat, and tears, do not transmit the virus.[18] Oral sex has little risk of transmitting the virus.[19]
 Ways to avoid catching HIV and preventing the spread include safe sex, treatment to prevent infection (""PrEP""), treatment to stop infection in someone who has been recently exposed (""PEP""),[4] treating those who are infected, and needle exchange programs. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication.[4]
 Recognized worldwide in the early 1980s,[20] HIV/AIDS has had a large impact on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination.[21] The disease also has large economic impacts.[21] There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS, such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact.[22] The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion, including the Catholic Church's position not to support condom use as prevention.[23] It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.[24]
 HIV made the jump from other primates to humans in west-central Africa in the early-to-mid-20th century.[25] AIDS was first recognized by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause—HIV infection—was identified in the early part of the decade.[20] Between the first time AIDS was readily identified through 2021, the disease is estimated to have caused at least 40 million deaths worldwide.[26] In 2021, there were 650,000 deaths and about 38 million people worldwide living with HIV.[8] An estimated 20.6 million of these people live in eastern and southern Africa.[27] HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading.[28]
 The United States' National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Gates Foundation have pledged $200 million focused on developing a global cure for AIDS.[29] While there is no cure or vaccine, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy.[5][6]
 There are three main stages of HIV infection: acute infection, clinical latency, and AIDS.[1][30]
 The initial period following infection with HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome.[30][31] Many individuals develop an illness like influenza, mononucleosis or glandular fever 2–4 weeks after exposure while others have no significant symptoms.[32][33] Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, tiredness, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals.[31][33] The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular, classically.[34] Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage.[31] Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur.[33] Neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occur.[33] The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.[33]
 These symptoms are not often recognized as signs of HIV infection. Family doctors or hospitals can misdiagnose cases as one of the many common infectious diseases with similar symptoms. Someone with an unexplained fever who may have been recently exposed to HIV should consider testing to find out if they have been infected.[33]
 The initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV.[1] Without treatment, this second stage of the natural history of HIV infection can last from about three years[35] to over 20 years[36] (on average, about eight years).[37] While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near the end of this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains.[1] Between 50% and 70% of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes (other than in the groin) for over three to six months.[30]
 Although most HIV-1 infected individuals have a detectable viral load and in the absence of treatment will eventually progress to AIDS, a small proportion (about 5%) retain high levels of CD4+ T cells (T helper cells) without antiretroviral therapy for more than five years.[33][38] These individuals are classified as ""HIV controllers"" or long-term nonprogressors (LTNP).[38] Another group consists of those who maintain a low or undetectable viral load without anti-retroviral treatment, known as ""elite controllers"" or ""elite suppressors"". They represent approximately 1 in 300 infected persons.[39]
 Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is defined as an HIV infection with either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per μL or the occurrence of specific diseases associated with HIV infection.[33] In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years.[33] The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis.[33] Other common signs include recurrent respiratory tract infections.[33]
 Opportunistic infections may be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that are normally controlled by the immune system.[40] Which infections occur depends partly on what organisms are common in the person's environment.[33] These infections may affect nearly every organ system.[41]
 People with AIDS have an increased risk of developing various viral-induced cancers, including Kaposi's sarcoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer.[34] Kaposi's sarcoma is the most common cancer, occurring in 10% to 20% of people with HIV.[42] The second-most common cancer is lymphoma, which is the cause of death of nearly 16% of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3% to 4%.[42] Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).[42] Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus (HPV).[42] Conjunctival cancer (of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye) is also more common in those with HIV.[43]
 Additionally, people with AIDS frequently have systemic symptoms such as prolonged fevers, sweats (particularly at night), swollen lymph nodes, chills, weakness, and unintended weight loss.[44] Diarrhea is another common symptom, present in about 90% of people with AIDS.[45] They can also be affected by diverse psychiatric and neurological symptoms independent of opportunistic infections and cancers.[46]
 HIV is spread by three main routes: sexual contact, significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission).[17] There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood.[55] It is also possible to be co-infected by more than one strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV superinfection.[56]
 The most frequent mode of transmission of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person.[17] However, an HIV-positive person who has an undetectable viral load as a result of long-term treatment has effectively no risk of transmitting HIV sexually.[14][15] The existence of functionally noncontagious HIV-positive people on antiretroviral therapy was controversially publicized in the 2008 Swiss Statement, and has since become accepted as medically sound.[57]
 Globally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex;[17] however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2017[update], most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (82% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 70% of total new diagnoses).[58][59] In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men.[60]
 With regard to unprotected heterosexual contacts, estimates of the risk of HIV transmission per sexual act appear to be four to ten times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries.[61] In low-income countries, the risk of female-to-male transmission is estimated as 0.38% per act, and of male-to-female transmission as 0.30% per act; the equivalent estimates for high-income countries are 0.04% per act for female-to-male transmission, and 0.08% per act for male-to-female transmission.[61] The risk of transmission from anal intercourse is especially high, estimated as 1.4–1.7% per act in both heterosexual and homosexual contacts.[61][62] While the risk of transmission from oral sex is relatively low, it is still present.[63] The risk from receiving oral sex has been described as ""nearly nil"";[64] however, a few cases have been reported.[65] The per-act risk is estimated at 0–0.04% for receptive oral intercourse.[66] In settings involving prostitution in low-income countries, risk of female-to-male transmission has been estimated as 2.4% per act, and of male-to-female transmission as 0.05% per act.[61]
 Risk of transmission increases in the presence of many sexually transmitted infections[67] and genital ulcers.[61] Genital ulcers appear to increase the risk approximately fivefold.[61] Other sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis, are associated with somewhat smaller increases in risk of transmission.[66]
 The viral load of an infected person is an important risk factor in both sexual and mother-to-child transmission.[68] During the first 2.5 months of an HIV infection a person's infectiousness is twelve times higher due to the high viral load associated with acute HIV.[66] If the person is in the late stages of infection, rates of transmission are approximately eightfold greater.[61]
 Commercial sex workers (including those in pornography) have an increased likelihood of contracting HIV.[69][70] Rough sex can be a factor associated with an increased risk of transmission.[71] Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.[72]
 The second-most frequent mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products.[17] Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle-stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63% and 2.4% per act, with an average of 0.8%.[73] The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act.[55] This risk may, however, be up to 5% if the introduced blood was from a person with a high viral load and the cut was deep.[74] In the United States, intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009,[75] and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV-positive.[17]
 HIV is transmitted in about 90% of blood transfusions using infected blood.[47] In developed countries the risk of acquiring HIV from a blood transfusion is extremely low (less than one in half a million) where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed;[17] for example, in the UK the risk is reported at one in five million[76] and in the United States it was one in 1.5 million in 2008.[77] In low-income countries, only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened (as of 2008),[78] and it is estimated that up to 15% of HIV infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products, representing between 5% and 10% of global infections.[17][79] It is possible to acquire HIV from organ and tissue transplantation, although this is rare because of screening.[80]
 Unsafe medical injections play a role in HIV spread in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2007, between 12% and 17% of infections in this region were attributed to medical syringe use.[81] The World Health Organization estimates the risk of transmission as a result of a medical injection in Africa at 1.2%.[81] Risks are also associated with invasive procedures, assisted delivery, and dental care in this area of the world.[81]
 People giving or receiving tattoos, piercings, and scarification are theoretically at risk of infection but no confirmed cases have been documented.[82] It is not possible for mosquitoes or other insects to transmit HIV.[83]
 HIV can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, during delivery, or through breast milk, resulting in the baby also contracting HIV.[17][84] As of 2008, vertical transmission accounted for about 90% of cases of HIV in children.[85] In the absence of treatment, the risk of transmission before or during birth is around 20%, and in those who also breastfeed 35%.[85] Treatment decreases this risk to less than 5%.[86]
 Antiretrovirals when taken by either the mother or the baby decrease the risk of transmission in those who do breastfeed.[87] If blood contaminates food during pre-chewing it may pose a risk of transmission.[82] If a woman is untreated, two years of breastfeeding results in an HIV/AIDS risk in her baby of about 17%.[88] Due to the increased risk of death without breastfeeding in many areas in the developing world, the World Health Organization recommends either exclusive breastfeeding or the provision of safe formula.[88] All women known to be HIV-positive should be taking lifelong antiretroviral therapy.[88]
 HIV is the cause of the spectrum of disease known as HIV/AIDS. HIV is a retrovirus that primarily infects components of the human immune system such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. It directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells.[89]
 HIV is a member of the genus Lentivirus,[90] part of the family Retroviridae.[91] Lentiviruses share many morphological and biological characteristics. Many species of mammals are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period.[92] Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors.[93] Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system.[94] Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.[95]
 HIV is now known to spread between CD4+ T cells by two parallel routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms.[96] In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter.[96] HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread.[97][98] The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus' ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.[96][99]
 Two types of HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the virus that was originally discovered (and initially referred to also as LAV or HTLV-III). It is more virulent, more infective,[100] and is the cause of the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2 as compared with HIV-1 implies that fewer people exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa.[101]
 After the virus enters the body, there is a period of rapid viral replication, leading to an abundance of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood.[102] This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.[103]
 Ultimately, HIV causes AIDS by depleting CD4+ T cells. This weakens the immune system and allows opportunistic infections. T cells are essential to the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells. The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases.[104] During the acute phase, HIV-induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by CD8+ T cells accounts for CD4+ T cell depletion, although apoptosis may also be a factor. During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of the immune system to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4+ T cell numbers.[105]
 Although the symptoms of immune deficiency characteristic of AIDS do not appear for years after a person is infected, the bulk of CD4+ T cell loss occurs during the first weeks of infection, especially in the intestinal mucosa, which harbors the majority of the lymphocytes found in the body.[106] The reason for the preferential loss of mucosal CD4+ T cells is that the majority of mucosal CD4+ T cells express the CCR5 protein which HIV uses as a co-receptor to gain access to the cells, whereas only a small fraction of CD4+ T cells in the bloodstream do so.[107] A specific genetic change that alters the CCR5 protein when present in both chromosomes very effectively prevents HIV-1 infection.[108]
 HIV seeks out and destroys CCR5 expressing CD4+ T cells during acute infection.[109] A vigorous immune response eventually controls the infection and initiates the clinically latent phase. CD4+ T cells in mucosal tissues remain particularly affected.[109] Continuous HIV replication causes a state of generalized immune activation persisting throughout the chronic phase.[110] Immune activation, which is reflected by the increased activation state of immune cells and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, results from the activity of several HIV gene products and the immune response to ongoing HIV replication. It is also linked to the breakdown of the immune surveillance system of the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier caused by the depletion of mucosal CD4+ T cells during the acute phase of disease.[111]
 HIV/AIDS is diagnosed via laboratory testing and then staged based on the presence of certain signs or symptoms.[31] HIV screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force for all people 15 years to 65 years of age, including all pregnant women.[113] Additionally, testing is recommended for those at high risk, which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness.[34][113] In many areas of the world, a third of HIV carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent.[34]
 Most people infected with HIV develop seroconverted (antigen-specific) antibodies within three to twelve weeks after the initial infection.[33] Diagnosis of primary HIV before seroconversion is done by measuring HIV-RNA or p24 antigen.[33] Positive results obtained by antibody or PCR testing are confirmed either by a different antibody or by PCR.[31]
 Antibody tests in children younger than 18 months are typically inaccurate, due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies.[114] Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen.[31] Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing, and people in many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing.[114] In sub-Saharan Africa between 2007 and 2009, between 30% and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status.[115] In 2009, between 3.6% and 42% of men and women in sub-Saharan countries were tested;[115] this represented a significant increase compared to previous years.[115]
 Two main clinical staging systems are used to classify HIV and HIV-related disease for surveillance purposes: the WHO disease staging system for HIV infection and disease,[31] and the CDC classification system for HIV infection.[116] The CDC's classification system is more frequently adopted in developed countries. Since the WHO's staging system does not require laboratory tests, it is suited to the resource-restricted conditions encountered in developing countries, where it can also be used to help guide clinical management. Despite their differences, the two systems allow a comparison for statistical purposes.[30][31][116]
 The World Health Organization first proposed a definition for AIDS in 1986.[31] Since then, the WHO classification has been updated and expanded several times, with the most recent version being published in 2007.[31] The WHO system uses the following categories:
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also created a classification system for HIV, and updated it in 2008 and 2014.[116][117] This system classifies HIV infections based on CD4 count and clinical symptoms, and describes the infection in five groups.[117] In those greater than six years of age it is:[117]
 For surveillance purposes, the AIDS diagnosis still stands even if, after treatment, the CD4+ T cell count rises to above 200 per μL of blood or other AIDS-defining illnesses are cured.[30]
 Consistent condom use reduces the risk of HIV transmission by approximately 80% over the long term.[118] When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year.[119] There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection.[120] Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women.[121] By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.[122]
 Circumcision in sub-Saharan Africa ""reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men by between 38% and 66% over 24 months"".[123] Owing to these studies, both the World Health Organization and UNAIDS recommended male circumcision in 2007 as a method of preventing female-to-male HIV transmission in areas with high rates of HIV.[124] However, whether it protects against male-to-female transmission is disputed,[125][126] and whether it is of benefit in developed countries and among men who have sex with men is undetermined.[127][128][129]
 Programs encouraging sexual abstinence do not appear to affect subsequent HIV risk.[130] Evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor.[131] Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high-risk behavior.[132][133] A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high-risk practices despite knowing about HIV/AIDS, underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV.[134] Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive.[135] Enhanced family planning services appear to increase the likelihood of women with HIV using contraception, compared to basic services.[136] It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV.[67]
 Antiretroviral treatment among people with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/μL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP).[137] TASP is associated with a 10- to 20-fold reduction in transmission risk.[137][138] Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (""PrEP"") with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in people at high risk including men who have sex with men, couples where one is HIV-positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa.[121][139] It may also be effective in intravenous drug users, with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100 person years.[140] The USPSTF, in 2019, recommended PrEP in those who are at high risk.[141]
 Universal precautions within the health care environment are believed to be effective in decreasing the risk of HIV.[142] Intravenous drug use is an important risk factor, and harm reduction strategies such as needle-exchange programs and opioid substitution therapy appear effective in decreasing this risk.[143][144]
 A course of antiretrovirals administered within 48 to 72 hours after exposure to HIV-positive blood or genital secretions is referred to as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).[145] The use of the single agent zidovudine reduces the risk of an HIV infection five-fold following a needle-stick injury.[145] As of 2013[update], the prevention regimen recommended in the United States consists of three medications—tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir—as this may reduce the risk further.[146]
 PEP treatment is recommended after a sexual assault when the perpetrator is known to be HIV-positive, but is controversial when their HIV status is unknown.[147] The duration of treatment is usually four weeks[148] and is frequently associated with adverse effects—where zidovudine is used, about 70% of cases result in adverse effects such as nausea (24%), fatigue (22%), emotional distress (13%) and headaches (9%).[55]
 Programs to prevent the vertical transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%.[85][143] This primarily involves the use of a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant, and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding.[85][149] If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however, exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case.[150] If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission.[151] In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.[152]
 Currently there is no licensed vaccine for HIV or AIDS.[6] The most effective vaccine trial to date, RV 144, was published in 2009; it found a partial reduction in the risk of transmission of roughly 30%, stimulating some hope in the research community of developing a truly effective vaccine.[153]
 There is currently no cure, nor an effective HIV vaccine. Treatment consists of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART), which slows progression of the disease.[154] As of 2022, 39 million people globally were living with HIV, and 29.8 million people were accessing ART.[155] Treatment also includes preventive and active treatment of opportunistic infections. As of July 2022[update], four people have been successfully cleared of HIV.[156][157][158] Rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy within one week of diagnosis appear to improve treatment outcomes in low and medium-income settings and is recommend for newly diagnosed HIV patients.[159][160]
 Current ART options are combinations (or ""cocktails"") consisting of at least three medications belonging to at least two types, or ""classes"", of antiretroviral agents.[161] There are eight classes of antiretroviral agents (ARVs), and over 30 individual drugs: nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase, inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), a fusion inhibitor, a CCR5 antagonist, a CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) post-attachment inhibitor, and a gp120 attachment inhibitor. There are also two drugs, ritonavir (RTV) and cobicistat (COBI) which can be used as pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancers (or boosters) to improve the PK profiles of PIs and the INSTI elvitegravir (EVG).[162] Depending on the guidelines being followed, initial treatment generally consists of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors along with a third ARV, either an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or a protease inhibitor with a pharmacokinetic enhancer (also known as a booster).[162]
 The World Health Organization and the United States recommend antiretrovirals in people of all ages (including pregnant women) as soon as the diagnosis is made, regardless of CD4 count.[13][163][164] Once treatment is begun, it is recommended that it is continued without breaks or ""holidays"".[34] Many people are diagnosed only after treatment ideally should have begun.[34] The desired outcome of treatment is a long-term plasma HIV-RNA count below 50 copies/mL.[34] Levels to determine if treatment is effective are initially recommended after four weeks and once levels fall below 50 copies/mL checks every three to six months are typically adequate.[34] Inadequate control is deemed to be greater than 400 copies/mL.[34] Based on these criteria treatment is effective in more than 95% of people during the first year.[34]
 Benefits of treatment include a decreased risk of progression to AIDS and a decreased risk of death.[165] In the developing world, treatment also improves physical and mental health.[166] With treatment, there is a 70% reduced risk of acquiring tuberculosis.[161] Additional benefits include a decreased risk of transmission of the disease to sexual partners and a decrease in mother-to-child transmission.[161][167] The effectiveness of treatment depends to a large part on compliance.[34] Reasons for non-adherence to treatment include poor access to medical care,[168] inadequate social supports, mental illness and drug abuse.[169] The complexity of treatment regimens (due to pill numbers and dosing frequency) and adverse effects may reduce adherence.[170] Even though cost is an important issue with some medications,[171] 47% of those who needed them were taking them in low- and middle-income countries as of 2010[update],[172] and the rate of adherence is similar in low-income and high-income countries.[173]
 Specific adverse events are related to the antiretroviral agent taken.[174] Some relatively common adverse events include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors.[30] Other common symptoms include diarrhea,[174][175] and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[176] Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects.[34] Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.[34]
 Treatment recommendations for children are somewhat different from those for adults. The World Health Organization recommends treating all children less than five years of age; children above five are treated like adults.[177] The United States guidelines recommend treating all children less than 12 months of age and all those with HIV RNA counts greater than 100,000 copies/mL between one year and five years of age.[178]
 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended the granting of marketing authorizations for two new antiretroviral (ARV) medicines, rilpivirine (Rekambys) and cabotegravir (Vocabria), to be used together for the treatment of people with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.[179] The two medicines are the first ARVs that come in a long-acting injectable formulation.[179] This means that instead of daily pills, people receive intramuscular injections monthly or every two months.[179]
 The combination of Rekambys and Vocabria injection is intended for maintenance treatment of adults who have undetectable HIV levels in the blood (viral load less than 50 copies/mL) with their current ARV treatment, and when the virus has not developed resistance to a certain class of anti-HIV medicines called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INIs).[179]
 Cabotegravir combined with rilpivirine (Cabenuva) is a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults to replace a current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and with no known or suspected resistance to either cabotegravir or rilpivirine.[180][181]
 Measures to prevent opportunistic infections are effective in many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals reduces the risk of developing additional opportunistic infections.[174]
 Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT); the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed.[182] Children with HIV may benefit from screening for tuberculosis.[183] Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however, it may also be given after infection.[184]
 Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age, and ceasing breastfeeding of infants born to HIV-positive mothers, is recommended in resource-limited settings.[185] It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200 cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP.[186] People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC.[187] Appropriate preventive measures reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997.[188] Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.[189][190]
 The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued recommendations regarding nutrient requirements in HIV/AIDS.[191] A generally healthy diet is promoted. Dietary intake of micronutrients at RDA levels by HIV-infected adults is recommended by the WHO; higher intake of vitamin A, zinc, and iron can produce adverse effects in HIV-positive adults, and is not recommended unless there is documented deficiency.[191][192][193][194] Dietary supplementation for people who are infected with HIV and who have inadequate nutrition or dietary deficiencies may strengthen their immune systems or help them recover from infections; however, evidence indicating an overall benefit in morbidity or reduction in mortality is not consistent.[195]
 People with HIV/AIDS are up to four times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who are not tested positive with the virus.[196]
 Evidence for supplementation with selenium is mixed with some tentative evidence of benefit.[197] For pregnant and lactating women with HIV, multivitamin supplement improves outcomes for both mothers and children.[198] If the pregnant or lactating mother has been advised to take anti-retroviral medication to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission, multivitamin supplements should not replace these treatments.[198] There is some evidence that vitamin A supplementation in children with an HIV infection reduces mortality and improves growth.[199]
 In the US, approximately 60% of people with HIV use various forms of complementary or alternative medicine,[200] whose effectiveness has not been established.[201] There is not enough evidence to support the use of herbal medicines.[202] There is insufficient evidence to recommend or support the use of medical cannabis to try to increase appetite or weight gain.[203]
 HIV/AIDS has become a chronic rather than an acutely fatal disease in many areas of the world.[204] Prognosis varies between people, and both the CD4 count and viral load are useful for predicted outcomes.[33] Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.[7] After the diagnosis of AIDS, if treatment is not available, survival ranges between 6 and 19 months.[205][206] ART and appropriate prevention of opportunistic infections reduces the death rate by 80%, and raises the life expectancy for a newly diagnosed young adult to 20–50 years.[204][207][208] This is between two thirds[207] and nearly that of the general population.[34][209] If treatment is started late in the infection, prognosis is not as good:[34] for example, if treatment is begun following the diagnosis of AIDS, life expectancy is ~10–40 years.[34][204] Half of infants born with HIV die before two years of age without treatment.[185][210]
 The primary causes of death from HIV/AIDS are opportunistic infections and cancer, both of which are frequently the result of the progressive failure of the immune system.[188][211] Risk of cancer appears to increase once the CD4 count is below 500/μL.[34] The rate of clinical disease progression varies widely between individuals and has been shown to be affected by a number of factors such as a person's susceptibility and immune function;[212] their access to health care, the presence of co-infections;[205][213] and the particular strain (or strains) of the virus involved.[214][215]
 Tuberculosis co-infection is one of the leading causes of sickness and death in those with HIV/AIDS being present in a third of all HIV-infected people and causing 25% of HIV-related deaths.[216] HIV is also one of the most important risk factors for tuberculosis.[217] Hepatitis C is another very common co-infection where each disease increases the progression of the other.[218] The two most common cancers associated with HIV/AIDS are Kaposi's sarcoma and AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.[211] Other cancers that are more frequent include anal cancer, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and cervical cancer.[34][219]
 Even with anti-retroviral treatment, over the long term HIV-infected people may experience neurocognitive disorders,[220] osteoporosis,[221] neuropathy,[222] cancers,[223][224] nephropathy,[225] and cardiovascular disease.[175] Some conditions, such as lipodystrophy, may be caused both by HIV and its treatment.[175]
 HIV/AIDS is considered a global pandemic.[227] As of 2022[update], approximately 39.0 million people worldwide are living with HIV, the number of new infections that year being about 1.3 million.[155] This is down from 2.1 million new infections in 2010.[155] Among new infections, 46% are in women and are children globally.[155] There were 630,000 AIDS related deaths in 2022, down from a peak of 2 million in 2005.[155]
 Among persons living with HIV (PLWH), the largest proportion reside in eastern and southern Africa (20.6 million, 54.6%). This region also had the highest rate of adult and child deaths due to AIDS in 2020 (310,000, 46.6%). Sub-Saharan African adolescent girls and young women (aged 15–24 years) account for 77% of new infections among this age-range globally.[155] Here, in contrast to other regions, adolescent girls and young women are three times more likely to acquire HIV than age-matched males.[155] Despite these statistics, overall, new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths have substantially decreased in this region since 2010.[228]
 Eastern Europe and central Asia has observed a 43% increase in new HIV infections and 32% increase in AIDS-related deaths since 2010, the highest of all global regions.[228] These infections are predominantly distributed in persons who inject drugs, with gay men and other men who have sex with men or persons who engage in transaction sex the second and third populations most impacted in this region.[228]
 At the end of 2019, United States indicated that approximately 1.2 million people aged ≥13 years were living with HIV, resulting in about 18,500 deaths in 2020.[229] There were 34,800 estimated new infections in the US in 2019, 53% of which were in the southern region of the country.[229] In addition to geographic location, significant disparities in HIV incidence exist among men, Black or Hispanic populations, and men who reported male-to-male sexual contact. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that in that year, 158,500 people or 13% of infected Americans were unaware of their infection.[229]
 In the United Kingdom as of 2015[update], there were approximately 101,200 cases which resulted in 594 deaths.[230] In Canada as of 2008, there were about 65,000 cases causing 53 deaths.[231] Between the first recognition of AIDS (in 1981) and 2009, it has led to nearly 30 million deaths.[232] Rates of HIV are lowest in North Africa and the Middle East (0.1% or less), East Asia (0.1%), and Western and Central Europe (0.2%).[233] The worst-affected European countries, in 2009 and 2012 estimates, are Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Moldova, Portugal and Belarus, in decreasing order of prevalence.[234]
 Groups at higher risk of acquiring HIV include persons who engage in transactional sex, gay men and other men who have sex with men, persons who inject drugs, transgender persons, and those who are incarcerated or detained.[155]
 The first news story on the disease appeared on May 18, 1981, in the gay newspaper New York Native.[235][236] AIDS was first clinically reported on June 5, 1981, with five cases in the United States.[42][237] The initial cases were a cluster of injecting drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems.[238] Soon thereafter, a large number of homosexual men developed a generally rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).[239][240] Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak.[241]
 In the early days, the CDC did not have an official name for the disease, often referring to it by way of diseases associated with it, such as lymphadenopathy, the disease after which the discoverers of HIV originally named the virus.[242][243] They also used Kaposi's sarcoma and opportunistic infections, the name by which a task force had been set up in 1981.[244] At one point the CDC referred to it as the ""4H disease"", as the syndrome seemed to affect heroin users, homosexuals, haemophiliacs, and Haitians.[245][246] The term GRID, which stood for gay-related immune deficiency, had also been coined.[247] However, after determining that AIDS was not isolated to the gay community,[244] it was realized that the term GRID was misleading, and the term AIDS was introduced at a meeting in July 1982.[248] By September 1982 the CDC started referring to the disease as AIDS.[249]
 In 1983, two separate research groups led by Robert Gallo and Luc Montagnier declared that a novel retrovirus may have been infecting people with AIDS, and published their findings in the same issue of the journal Science.[250][243] Gallo claimed a virus which his group had isolated from a person with AIDS was strikingly similar in shape to other human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs) that his group had been the first to isolate. Gallo's group called their newly isolated virus HTLV-III. At the same time, Montagnier's group isolated a virus from a person presenting with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck and physical weakness, two characteristic symptoms of AIDS. Contradicting the report from Gallo's group, Montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of HTLV-I. Montagnier's group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV).[241] As these two viruses turned out to be the same, in 1986, LAV and HTLV-III were renamed HIV.[251]
 The origin of HIV / AIDS and the circumstances that led to its emergence remain unsolved.[252]
 Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are believed to have originated in non-human primates in West-central Africa and were transferred to humans in the early 20th century.[25] HIV-1 appears to have originated in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIV(cpz), a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) that infects wild chimpanzees (HIV-1 descends from the SIVcpz endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes).[253][254] The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys atys), an Old World monkey living in coastal West Africa (from southern Senegal to western Ivory Coast).[101] New World monkeys such as the owl monkey are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes.[255] HIV-1 is thought to have jumped the species barrier on at least three separate occasions, giving rise to the three groups of the virus, M, N, and O.[256]
 There is evidence that humans who participate in bushmeat activities, either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors, commonly acquire SIV.[257] However, SIV is a weak virus which is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection. It is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into HIV.[258] Furthermore, due to its relatively low person-to-person transmission rate, SIV can only spread throughout the population in the presence of one or more high-risk transmission channels, which are thought to have been absent in Africa before the 20th century.[259]
 Specific proposed high-risk transmission channels, allowing the virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to c. 1910.[260] Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of prostitution, and the accompanying high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities.[261] While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are low under regular circumstances, they are increased manyfold if one of the partners has a sexually transmitted infection causing genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable for their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers, to the degree that, as of 1928, as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Kinshasa were thought to have been prostitutes, and, as of 1933, around 15% of all residents of the same city had syphilis.[261]
 An alternative view holds that unsafe medical practices in Africa after World War II, such as unsterile reuse of single-use syringes during mass vaccination, antibiotic and anti-malaria treatment campaigns, were the initial vector that allowed the virus to adapt to humans and spread.[258][262][263]
 The earliest well-documented case of HIV in a human dates back to 1959 in the Congo.[264] The virus may have been present in the U.S. as early as the mid-to-late 1950s, as a sixteen-year-old male named Robert Rayford presented with symptoms in 1966 and died in 1969. In the 1970s, there were cases of getting parasites and becoming sick with what was called ""gay bowel disease"", but what is now suspected to have been AIDS.[265]
 The earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS is believed to have been in Norway beginning in 1966, that of Arvid Noe.[266] In July 1960, in the wake of Congo's independence, the United Nations recruited Francophone experts and technicians from all over the world to assist in filling administrative gaps left by Belgium, who did not leave behind an African elite to run the country. By 1962, Haitians made up the second-largest group of well-educated experts (out of the 48 national groups recruited), that totaled around 4,500 in the country.[267][268] Dr. Jacques Pépin, a Canadian author of The Origins of AIDS, stipulates that Haiti was one of HIV's entry points to the U.S. and that a Haitian may have carried HIV back across the Atlantic in the 1960s.[268] Although there was known to have been at least one case of AIDS in the U.S. from 1966,[269] the vast majority of infections occurring outside sub-Saharan Africa (including the U.S.) can be traced back to a single unknown individual who became infected with HIV in Haiti and brought the infection to the U.S. at some time around 1969.[252] The epidemic rapidly spread among high-risk groups (initially, sexually promiscuous men who have sex with men). By 1978, the prevalence of HIV-1 among gay male residents of New York City and San Francisco was estimated at 5%, suggesting that several thousand individuals in the country had been infected.[252]
 AIDS stigma exists around the world in a variety of ways, including ostracism, rejection, discrimination and avoidance of HIV-infected people; compulsory HIV testing without prior consent or protection of confidentiality; violence against HIV-infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with HIV; and the quarantine of HIV-infected individuals.[21] Stigma-related violence or the fear of violence prevents many people from seeking HIV testing, returning for their results, or securing treatment, possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating the spread of HIV.[271]
 AIDS stigma has been further divided into the following three categories:
 Often, AIDS stigma is expressed in conjunction with one or more other stigmas, particularly those associated with homosexuality, bisexuality, promiscuity, prostitution, and intravenous drug use.[274]
 In many developed countries, there is an association between AIDS and homosexuality or bisexuality, and this association is correlated with higher levels of sexual prejudice, such as anti-homosexual or anti-bisexual attitudes.[275] There is also a perceived association between AIDS and all male-male sexual behavior, including sex between uninfected men.[272] However, the dominant mode of spread worldwide for HIV remains heterosexual transmission.[276]
 The NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt was conceived in 1985 to celebrate the lives of those who had died of AIDS when stigma prevented many from receiving funerals. It is now cared for by the National AIDS Memorial in San Francisco.
 In 2003, as part of an overall reform of marriage and population legislation, it became legal for those diagnosed with AIDS to marry in China.[277]
 In 2013, the U.S. National Library of Medicine developed a traveling exhibition titled Surviving and Thriving: AIDS, Politics, and Culture;[278] this covered medical research, the U.S. government's response, and personal stories from people with AIDS, caregivers, and activists.[279]
 Stigma has proved an obstacle to the update of PrEP.  Within the MSM community, the greatest barrier to PrEP use has been the stigma surrounding HIV and gay men. Gay men on PrEP have experienced ""slut-shaming"".[280][281]  Numerous other barriers have been identified, including lack of quality LGBTQ care, cost, and adherence to medication use.[282]
 HIV/AIDS affects the economics of both individuals and countries.[283] The gross domestic product of the most affected countries has decreased due to the lack of human capital.[283][284] Without proper nutrition, health care and medicine, large numbers of people die from AIDS-related complications. Before death they will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. It is estimated that as of 2007 there were 12 million AIDS orphans.[283] Many are cared for by elderly grandparents.[285]
 Returning to work after beginning treatment for HIV/AIDS is difficult, and affected people often work less than the average worker. Unemployment in people with HIV/AIDS also is associated with suicidal ideation, memory problems, and social isolation. Employment increases self-esteem, sense of dignity, confidence, and quality of life for people with HIV/AIDS. Anti-retroviral treatment may help people with HIV/AIDS work more, and may increase the chance that a person with HIV/AIDS will be employed (low-quality evidence).[286]
 By affecting mainly young adults, AIDS reduces the taxable population, in turn reducing the resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to AIDS, resulting in increasing pressure on the state's finances and slower growth of the economy. This causes a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay, and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.[285]
 At the household level, AIDS causes both loss of income and increased spending on healthcare. A study in Côte d'Ivoire showed that households having a person with HIV/AIDS spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households. This additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment.[287]
 The topic of religion and AIDS has become highly controversial, primarily because some religious authorities have publicly declared their opposition to the use of condoms.[288][289] The religious approach to prevent the spread of AIDS, according to a report by American health expert Matthew Hanley titled The Catholic Church and the Global AIDS Crisis, argues that cultural changes are needed, including a re-emphasis on fidelity within marriage and sexual abstinence outside of it.[289]
 Some religious organizations have claimed that prayer can cure HIV/AIDS. In 2011, the BBC reported that some churches in London were claiming that prayer would cure AIDS, and the Hackney-based Centre for the Study of Sexual Health and HIV reported that several people stopped taking their medication, sometimes on the direct advice of their pastor, leading to many deaths.[290] The Synagogue Church Of All Nations advertised an ""anointing water"" to promote God's healing, although the group denies advising people to stop taking medication.[290]
 One of the first high-profile cases of AIDS was the American gay actor Rock Hudson. He had been diagnosed during 1984, announced that he had had the virus on July 25, 1985, and died a few months later on October 2, 1985.[291] Another notable British casualty of AIDS that year was Nicholas Eden, a gay politician and son of former prime minister Anthony Eden.[292] On November 24, 1991, British rock star Freddie Mercury died from an AIDS-related illness, having revealed the diagnosis only on the previous day.[293]
 One of the first high-profile heterosexual cases of the virus was American tennis player Arthur Ashe. He was diagnosed as HIV-positive on August 31, 1988, having contracted the virus from blood transfusions during heart surgery earlier in the 1980s. Further tests within 24 hours of the initial diagnosis revealed that Ashe had AIDS, but he did not tell the public about his diagnosis until April 1992.[294] He died as a result on February 6, 1993, aged 49.[295]
 Therese Frare's photograph of gay activist David Kirby, as he lay dying from AIDS while surrounded by family, was taken in April 1990. Life magazine said the photo became the one image ""most powerfully identified with the HIV/AIDS epidemic."" The photo was displayed in Life, was the winner of the World Press Photo, and acquired worldwide notoriety after being used in a United Colors of Benetton advertising campaign in 1992.[296]
 Many famous artists and AIDS activists such as Larry Kramer, Diamanda Galás and Rosa von Praunheim[297] campaign for AIDS education and the rights of those affected. These artists worked with various media formats.
 Criminal transmission of HIV is the intentional or reckless infection of a person with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Some countries or jurisdictions, including some areas of the United States, have laws that criminalize HIV transmission or exposure.[298] Others may charge the accused under laws enacted before the HIV pandemic.
 In 1996, Ugandan-born Canadian Johnson Aziga was diagnosed with HIV; he subsequently had unprotected sex with eleven women without disclosing his diagnosis. By 2003, seven had contracted HIV; two died from complications related to AIDS.[299][300] Aziga was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.[301]
 There are many misconceptions about HIV and AIDS. Three misconceptions are that AIDS can spread through casual contact, that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure AIDS,[302][303][304] and that HIV can infect only gay men and drug users.[305][306] In 2014, some among the British public wrongly thought one could get HIV from kissing (16%), sharing a glass (5%), spitting (16%), a public toilet seat (4%), and coughing or sneezing (5%).[307] Other misconceptions are that any act of anal intercourse between two uninfected gay men can lead to HIV infection, and that open discussion of HIV and homosexuality in schools will lead to increased rates of AIDS.[308][309]
 A small group of individuals continue to dispute the connection between HIV and AIDS,[310] the existence of HIV itself, or the validity of HIV testing and treatment methods.[311][312] These claims, known as AIDS denialism, have been examined and rejected by the scientific community.[313] However, they have had a significant political impact, particularly in South Africa, where the government's official embrace of AIDS denialism (1999–2005) was responsible for its ineffective response to that country's AIDS epidemic, and has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths and HIV infections.[314][315][316]
 Several discredited conspiracy theories have held that HIV was created by scientists, either inadvertently or deliberately. Operation INFEKTION was a worldwide Soviet active measures operation to spread the claim that the United States had created HIV/AIDS. Surveys show that a significant number of people believed—and continue to believe—in such claims.[317]
 HIV/AIDS research includes all medical research which attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS, along with fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent, and about AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.
 Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral health interventions such as sex education, and drug development, such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV vaccines, and antiretroviral drugs. Other medical research areas include the topics of pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, and circumcision and HIV. Public health officials, researchers, and programs can gain a more comprehensive picture of the barriers they face, and the efficacy of current approaches to HIV treatment and prevention, by tracking standard HIV indicators.[318] Use of common indicators is an increasing focus of development organizations and researchers.[319][320]

"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is an ongoing, also called chronic, condition. It's caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, also called HIV. HIV damages the immune system so that the body is less able to fight infection and disease. If HIV isn't treated, it can take years before it weakens the immune system enough to become AIDS. Thanks to treatment, most people in the U.S. don't get AIDS. HIV is spread through contact with genitals, such as during sex without a condom. This type of infection is called a sexually transmitted infection, also called an STI. HIV also is spread through contact with blood, such as when people share needles or syringes. It is also possible for a person with untreated HIV to spread the virus to a child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. There's no cure for HIV/AIDS. But medicines can control the infection and keep the disease from getting worse. Antiviral treatments for HIV have reduced AIDS deaths around the world. There's an ongoing effort to make ways to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS more available in resource-poor countries. The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary depending on the person and the phase of infection. Some people infected by HIV get a flu-like illness within 2 to 4 weeks after the virus enters the body. This stage may last a few days to several weeks. Some people have no symptoms during this stage. Possible symptoms include: These symptoms can be so mild that you might not notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream, called viral load, is high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads to others more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. In this stage of infection, HIV is still in the body and cells of the immune system, called white blood cells. But during this time, many people don't have symptoms or the infections that HIV can cause. This stage can last for many years for people who aren't getting antiretroviral therapy, also called ART. Some people get more-severe disease much sooner. As the virus continues to multiply and destroy immune cells, you may get mild infections or long-term symptoms such as: Better antiviral treatments have greatly decreased deaths from AIDS worldwide. Thanks to these lifesaving treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't get AIDS. Untreated, HIV most often turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years. Having AIDS means your immune system is very damaged. People with AIDS are more likely to develop diseases they wouldn't get if they had healthy immune systems. These are called opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers. Some people get opportunistic infections during the acute stage of the disease. The symptoms of some of these infections may include: If you think you may have been infected with HIV or are at risk of contracting the virus, see a healthcare professional as soon as you can.

Please, try again in a couple of minutes HIV is caused by a virus. It can spread through sexual contact, shooting of illicit drugs or use of shared needles, and contact with infected blood. It also can spread from parent to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. HIV destroys white blood cells called CD4 T cells. These cells play a large role in helping the body fight disease. The fewer CD4 T cells you have, the weaker your immune system becomes. You can have an HIV infection with few or no symptoms for years before it turns into AIDS. AIDS is diagnosed when the CD4 T cell count falls below 200 or you have a complication you get only if you have AIDS, such as a serious infection or cancer. You can get infected with HIV if infected blood, semen or fluids from a vagina enter your body. This can happen when you: You can't become infected with HIV through casual contact. That means you can't catch HIV or get AIDS by hugging, kissing, dancing or shaking hands with someone who has the infection. HIV isn't spread through air, water or insect bites. You can't get HIV by donating blood. Anyone of any age, race, sex or sexual orientation can have HIV/AIDS. However, you're at greatest risk of HIV/AIDS if you: HIV  infection weakens your immune system. The infection makes you much more likely to get many infections and certain types of cancers. Toxoplasmosis. This infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools. The parasites then can spread to other animals and humans. Toxoplasmosis can cause heart disease. Seizures happen when it spreads to the brain. And it can be fatal. There's no vaccine to prevent HIV infection and no cure for HIV/AIDS. But you can protect yourself and others from infection. To help prevent the spread of HIV: Consider preexposure prophylaxis, also called PrEP. There are two PrEP medicines taken by mouth, also called oral, and one PrEP medicine given in the form of a shot, called injectable. The oral medicines are emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine-tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy). The injectable medicine is called cabotegravir (Apretude). PrEP can reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in people at very high risk. PrEP can reduce the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% and from injecting drugs by at least 74%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Descovy hasn't been studied in people who have sex by having a penis put into their vaginas, called receptive vaginal sex. Cabotegravir (Apretude) is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved PrEP that can be given as a shot to reduce the risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in people at very high risk. A healthcare professional gives the shot. After two once-monthly shots, Apretude is given every two months. The shot is an option in place of a daily PrEP pill. Your healthcare professional prescribes these medicines to prevent HIV only to people who don't already have HIV infection. You need an HIV test before you start taking any PrEP. You need to take the test every three months for the pills or before each shot for as long as you take PrEP. You need to take the pills every day or closely follow the shot schedule. You still need to practice safe sex to protect against other STIs. If you have hepatitis B, you should see an infectious disease or liver specialist before beginning PrEP therapy. Use treatment as prevention, also called TasP. If you have HIV, taking HIV medicines can keep your partner from getting infected with the virus. If your blood tests show no virus, that means your viral load can't be detected. Then you won't transmit the virus to anyone else through sex. If you use TasP, you must take your medicines exactly as prescribed and get regular checkups. Use a new condom every time you have anal or vaginal sex. Both male and female condoms are available. If you use a lubricant, make sure it's water based. Oil-based lubricants can weaken condoms and cause them to break. During oral sex, use a cut-open condom or a piece of medical-grade latex called a dental dam without a lubricant.

"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV weakens your immune system by destroying your T-cells until you are unable to fight off even minor illnesses. You can have HIV without any symptoms. Getting tested and starting treatment early gives you the best chance of living a long life. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. HIV infects and destroys cells of your immune system, making it hard to fight off other diseases. When HIV has severely weakened your immune system, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Because HIV works backward to insert its instructions into your DNA, it is called a retrovirus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy AIDS is the final and most serious stage of an HIV infection. People with AIDS have very low counts of certain white blood cells and severely damaged immune systems. They may have additional illnesses that indicate that they have progressed to AIDS. Without treatment, HIV infections progress to AIDS in about 10 years. The difference between HIV and AIDS is that HIV is a virus that weakens your immune system. AIDS is a condition that can happen as a result of an HIV infection when your immune system is severely weakened. You can’t get AIDS if you aren’t infected with HIV. Thanks to treatment that slows down the effects of the virus, not everyone with HIV progresses to AIDS. But without treatment, almost all people living with HIV will advance to AIDS. Advertisement HIV infects white blood cells of your immune system called CD4 cells, or helper T cells. It destroys CD4 cells, causing your white blood cell count to drop. This leaves you with an immune system that can’t fight off infections, even those that wouldn’t normally make you sick. HIV initially makes you feel sick with flu-like symptoms. Then it can hide in your body for a long time without causing noticeable symptoms. During that time, it slowly destroys your T-cells. When your T-cells get very low or you begin to get certain illnesses that people with healthy immune systems don’t get, HIV has progressed to AIDS. AIDS can cause rapid weight loss, extreme tiredness, mouth or genital ulcers, fevers, night sweats and skin discolorations. Other illnesses and cancers often happen in people living with AIDS and can cause additional symptoms. A retrovirus is a virus that works backward from the way human cells do. Human cells have instructions (DNA) that send a message (RNA) to make building blocks for your body (proteins). Retroviruses have their instructions written on RNA. When a retrovirus invades your cells, it changes its RNA to look like your cells’ instructions (DNA). Then it cuts your cells’ DNA and inserts its instructions into them. Your cell then acts as though the virus’ instructions are its own. HIV is a retrovirus. All viruses invade your cells and then use your cells’ “machinery” to make more copies of themselves. HIV not only uses your cells to make more of itself, but it also inserts its instructions into your DNA. It’s a myth that HIV only infects certain people. Anyone can get HIV if they’re exposed to the virus. Having sex without a condom or sharing needles to inject drugs are the most common ways that HIV spreads. Some populations are statistically more affected by HIV than others. Groups disproportionately affected by HIV include: While these aren’t the only populations impacted by HIV, it’s important to consider that they face unique barriers to accessing preventative care, getting tested, and receiving comprehensive treatment. Homophobia, racism, poverty, and social stigmas around HIV continue to drive inequities and keep people from accessing high-quality healthcare. Advertisement The number of new HIV infections has declined. In 2019, 1.2 million people in the US were living with HIV. About 13% of those don’t know they have it, which is why routine testing for HIV is important. You can have HIV without having any symptoms. This is why it’s important to get tested even if you don’t feel sick. Sometimes you’ll have flu-like symptoms when you first get infected with HIV. These can include: HIV has three stages: Some people get flu-like symptoms a month or two after they’ve been infected with HIV. These symptoms often go away within a week to a month. After the acute stage, you can have HIV for many years without feeling sick. It's important to know that you can still spread HIV to others even if you feel well. AIDS is the most serious stage of HIV infection. In this stage, HIV has severely weakened your immune system and opportunistic infections are much more likely to make you sick. Opportunistic infections are ones that someone with a healthy immune system could typically fight off. When HIV has advanced to AIDS, these illnesses take advantage of your weakened immune system. You’re more likely to get certain cancers when you have AIDS. These cancers and opportunistic infections together are called AIDS-defining illnesses. To be diagnosed with AIDS, you must be infected with HIV and have at least one of the following: AIDS-defining illnesses are opportunistic infections, certain cancers (usually caused by viruses) and some neurological conditions. They include: Symptoms of AIDS can be caused by HIV infection, but many are from illnesses that take advantage of your weakened immune system. HIV is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus. The virus attacks the helper T-cells of your immune system, leaving it weakened. AIDS is caused by having too few immune cells to fight off other illnesses. You can get HIV through the blood, semen, vaginal fluids, breast milk and rectal fluids of an infected person. People of all sexes and sexual orientations can get infected with and spread HIV. The virus can enter your body through your mouth, anus, penis, vagina or broken skin. It can’t get through your skin unless you have a cut or wound. Pregnant people with HIV can also give it to their babies. Having sex without a condom and sharing needles to take drugs are the most common ways that HIV spreads. Even if you feel fine, you can still give HIV to others. Since HIV is not spread through spit, kissing is not a common way to get infected. In certain situations where other body fluids are shared, such as if both people have open sores in their mouths or bleeding gums, there is a chance you could get HIV from deep, open-mouthed kissing. You also don’t get HIV from: You can’t tell if someone has HIV just by looking at them, and you may not have any symptoms if you’re infected by HIV. The only way to know if you have HIV is to take an HIV test. Since nearly 1 out of 7 people with HIV don’t know it, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention recommends screening people between the ages of 13 to 64 at least once as part of routine healthcare. This test is voluntary and confidential. HIV is diagnosed with either a test of your blood or your spit (saliva). You can take a test at home, in a healthcare provider’s office or at a location that provides testing in your community. If your test comes back negative, no further testing is required if: If you have had a possible exposure within three months of testing, you should consider retesting to confirm the negative result. If your test comes back positive, the lab may do follow-up tests to confirm the result. There are three types of HIV tests: antigen/antibody tests, antibody tests and nucleic acid tests (NATs): Antigen tests look for markers on the surface of HIV called p24. Antibody tests look for chemicals your body makes when it reacts to those markers. HIV antigen/antibody tests look for both. A healthcare provider will take a small sample of blood from your arm with a needle. The blood is sent to a lab and tested for p24 and antibodies to it. An antigen/antibody test is usually able to detect HIV in 18 to 45 days after exposure. A rapid antigen/antibody test may also be done with a finger prick to draw blood. You’ll need to wait at least 18 days after exposure for this type of test to be able to detect HIV. You may need to take the test up to 90 days after exposure for accurate results. (“Rapid” refers to the amount of time it takes to get test results, not the amount of time after exposure it takes to detect the virus.) These tests look for antibodies to HIV in your blood or saliva. This can be done with a blood draw from your arm, a finger prick or with a stick that you rub on your gums to collect saliva. An antibody test can take 23 to 90 days after exposure to detect HIV. Antibody tests done with a blood draw can detect HIV sooner than those done with saliva or blood from a finger prick. NATs look for the HIV virus in your blood. A healthcare provider will take a small sample of blood from your arm with a needle. The blood then is sent to a lab and tested for HIV. A NAT can typically detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. Note that this test isn’t often used unless you have had a high-risk exposure. If your test comes back positive, your healthcare provider is likely to recommend other tests to assess your health. These may include a complete blood count (CBC), along with: Yes, there are at-home HIV test kits. Some are rapid tests, where you use a stick with a soft, flexible tip to rub your gums. Then you put the stick in a tube with a special solution to get your results. Results show up in 15 to 20 minutes. Other at-home tests use a device to prick your finger with a small needle. You put a drop of blood on a card and send the test kit through the mail to a lab to get your results. If your at-home test result is positive, you should contact your healthcare provider for additional testing to confirm your result. There is currently no cure for HIV, but there are many treatment options that can slow the progression of HIV significantly. HIV is treated with a combination of medicines (pills) taken by mouth every day. This combination of pills is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). Taking a combination of types of pills, rather than just one, is the most effective way to keep HIV from multiplying and destroying your cells. There are also combination pills that have several medications in a single pill. Your healthcare provider will carefully select a combination specifically for you. The goal of ART is to reduce HIV in the blood (viral load) to an amount that’s not detectable by an HIV test and to slow HIV’s weakening of your immune system. Each type of pill used in ART has a different way of keeping HIV from making more copies of itself or from infecting your cells. There can be many different brand names of the same type of ART drug. Types of ART medications include: It's very important to take your medications as prescribed and to make sure you don’t miss appointments. This is called treatment adherence. If you miss medications, even by accident, HIV can change how it infects your cells (mutate), potentially causing your medications to stop working. If your schedule prevents you from taking medications on time or making it to appointments, talk to your healthcare provider. The best way to reduce your risk of HIV is to be aware of how it spreads and protect yourself during certain activities. Having sex without a condom and sharing needles to take drugs are the most common ways that HIV spreads. These are some ways to reduce your risk: It's important to use a condom correctly to protect yourself against HIV. Use a male condom for any sex act that involves your penis. You can also protect the vagina or anus with dental dams or internal condoms. Dental dams are flat pieces of polyurethane or latex that you can put over your vagina or anus if you are having oral sex. An internal condom (also called a female condom) can be used by insertion into your vagina or anus. You should only use one type of condom at a time. Do not use both a male condom and an internal condom. There are medications that can help prevent HIV in people who have been exposed or are at high risk for exposure. These include pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PrEP is a pill you take every day if you don’t have HIV but are at high risk of getting infected. Specifically, it’s recommended that you take PrEP if you don’t have HIV, if you have had anal or vaginal sex in the past six months and at least one of the following is true: PrEP is also recommended if you don’t have HIV, you inject drugs and at least one of the following is true: PrEP is not a replacement for other preventative measures. You should still use condoms and avoid sharing needles to inject drugs while taking PrEP. PEP uses HIV medicines to try to prevent an HIV infection soon after you are exposed. PEP is for those who don’t have HIV or don’t know if they have HIV and think they’ve been exposed through consensual sex, sexual assault, shared needles (or other equipment), or work. You must start PEP within 72 hours of exposure and take it every day for 28 days. PEP is only for emergency use and does not replace other precautions, like condom use. If you’re diagnosed with HIV, it’s important to know that those living with HIV who follow treatment guidelines can live full lives for nearly as long as those without HIV. If you have a high CD4 count and an undetectable viral load within a year of starting treatment, research suggests you’ll have the best outcomes, as long as you continue your treatment plan. You can improve your outlook by: ART can keep blood levels undetectable but can’t entirely rid your body of the virus (which remains inactive in your cells). If you don’t take your medication every day, the virus can start multiplying again and mutate, which may cause your medications to stop working. Left untreated, it can take about 10 years for HIV to advance to AIDS. If you progress to AIDS and it goes untreated, you can expect to live about three years more. For those on treatment, if you have a high CD4 count and undetectable viral load within a year of starting treatment, you can expect to live about as long as someone without HIV. If you have a low CD4 count or a detectable viral load within a year of starting treatment, you may live 10 to 20 years less than someone without HIV. HIV doesn’t go away on its own. It inserts itself into your DNA so your cells think that it’s a part of you. There can be many years without symptoms after initial infection, but HIV can still be damaging your immune system even if you don’t feel sick. There may be periods while on medication where the virus is not detectable by an HIV test. In these cases, HIV can be hiding in your body, undetected. It can “wake up” and start destroying your cells again in the future. This is why continuing to take HIV medication, even if you don’t feel sick or the virus is undetectable, is extremely important. Without treatment, HIV will weaken your immune system until you can’t fight off other serious illnesses. The best way to take care of yourself while living with HIV is to follow your treatment plan. The best ways to keep from spreading HIV to others are many of the same ways you use to protect yourself: Some people think that HIV hurts your chances of getting pregnant, but this isn’t true. If you have HIV and want to become pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider. Together you can make a plan before you try to get pregnant to keep you, your partner and any future children healthy. HIV can spread to your partner during unprotected sex and to your baby during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding. Taking ART medications can greatly reduce your risk of transmitting HIV to your baby, especially if you have an undetectable viral load. Your provider may recommend that you don’t breastfeed your baby and use formula instead. Call your healthcare provider immediately if you think you’ve been exposed to HIV. It is important to begin treatment as soon as possible if you do have HIV. If you already know you have HIV, you should follow your healthcare provider’s instructions on when to call. It is important to treat any type of infection, so call if you have new symptoms like fever, night sweats, diarrhea or anything else that concerns you. A note from Cleveland Clinic Treatments have come a long way since the height of the AIDS epidemic. You have the best chance of living a long life if you’re diagnosed early and are able to get on and stick with ART medications. People living with HIV today are able to work, have active social lives and families, and pursue fulfilling relationships. In fact, this can have a positive impact on your well-being. While we’ve come a long way with treatments, unfortunately, social stigmas around HIV still persist. In addition to the feelings of fear and uncertainty a new diagnosis can bring, you may wonder how those around you will respond. If you’re hesitant to get tested or get treatment, or if you just aren’t sure what your next steps are, you can reach out to a community organization that specializes in HIV. Remember that you are deserving of support, compassion and high-quality healthcare. Last reviewed on 06/06/2022. Learn more about our editorial process.

 HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that damages the cells in your immune system and weakens your ability to fight everyday infections and disease. AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is the name used to describe a number of potentially life-threatening infections and illnesses that happen when your immune system has been severely damaged by the HIV virus. While AIDS cannot be transmitted from 1 person to another, the HIV virus can. There's currently no cure for HIV, but there are very effective drug treatments that enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life.  With an early diagnosis and effective treatments, most people with HIV will not develop any AIDS-related illnesses and will live a near-normal lifespan. Most people experience a short flu-like illness 2 to 6 weeks after HIV infection, which lasts for a week or 2. After these symptoms disappear, HIV may not cause any symptoms for many years, although the virus continues to damage your immune system. This means many people with HIV do not know they're infected. Anyone who thinks they could have HIV should get tested. Some people are advised to have regular tests as they're at particularly high risk. Read more about who's most at risk of HIV HIV is found in the body fluids of an infected person. This includes semen, vaginal and anal fluids, blood and breast milk. It's a fragile virus and does not survive outside the body for long. HIV cannot be transmitted through sweat, urine or saliva. The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through having anal or vaginal sex without a condom. Other ways of getting HIV include: The chance of getting HIV through oral sex is very low and will be dependent on many things, such as whether you receive or give oral sex and the oral hygiene of the person giving the oral sex. If you received a blood transfusion or blood products before 1996, there's a chance you may have been infected with HIV. If you've contracted HIV from infected blood help and support is available. Find out more about support for people who may have been affected by infected blood. Seek medical advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV. You can get tested in a number of places, including at a GP surgery, sexual health clinics and clinics run by charities. Find HIV testing services near you The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or saliva for signs of the infection. It's important to be aware that: Both positive and negative HIV tests may need to be repeated 1 to 3 months after potential exposure to HIV infection (this is known as the window period), but you should not wait this long to seek help: If your first test suggests you have HIV, a further blood test will need to be carried out to confirm the result. If this is positive, you'll be referred to a specialist HIV clinic for some more tests and a discussion about your treatment options. Antiretroviral medicines are used to treat HIV. They work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day. HIV is able to develop resistance to a single HIV medicine very easily, but taking a combination of different medicines makes this much less likely. Most people with HIV take a combination of medicines. It's vital these are taken every day as recommended by your doctor. The goal of HIV treatment is to have an undetectable viral load. This means the level of HIV virus in your body is low enough to not be detected by a test. If you're living with HIV, taking effective HIV treatment and being undetectable significantly reduces your risk of passing HIV on to others. You'll also be encouraged to: Without treatment, the immune system will become severely damaged, and life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and severe infections can occur.If you're planning on getting pregnant, it's important to talk to a GP. Although rare, it's possible to transmit HIV to your baby. Anyone who has sex without a condom or shares needles is at risk of HIV infection. There are many effective ways to prevent or reduce the risk of HIV infection, including: Speak to your local sexual health clinic or a GP for further advice about the best way to reduce your risk. For people with HIV, if you have been taking effective HIV treatment and your viral load has been undetectable for 6 months or more, it means you cannot pass the virus on through sex. This is called undetectable=untransmittable (U=U). NAM aidsmap: undetectable equals untransmittable (U=U) consensus statement

            Health A to Z
          
 Alkaptonuria, or black urine disease, is a very rare inherited disorder that prevents the body fully breaking down two protein building blocks (amino acids) called tyrosine and phenylalanine. It results in a build-up of a chemical called homogentisic acid in the body. This can turn urine and parts of the body a dark colour and lead to a range of health problems over time. Amino acids are usually broken down in a series of chemical reactions. But in alkaptonuria a substance produced along the way, homogentisic acid, cannot be broken down any further. This is because the enzyme that normally breaks it down does not work properly. Enzymes are proteins that make chemical reactions happen. One of the earliest signs of the condition is dark-stained nappies, as homogentisic acid causes urine to turn black when exposed to air for a few hours. If this sign is missed or overlooked in a baby or child, the disorder may go unnoticed until adulthood, as there are usually no other noticeable symptoms until the person reaches their late 20s to early 30s. Over the course of many years, homogentisic acid slowly builds up in tissues throughout the body. It can build up in almost any area of the body, including the cartilage, tendons, bones, nails, ears and heart. It stains the tissues dark and causes a wide range of problems. When a person with alkaptonuria reaches their 30s, they may start to experience joint problems. Typically, they'll have lower back pain and stiffness, followed by knee, hip and shoulder pain. These are similar to the early symptoms of osteoarthritis.  Eventually, cartilage – a tough, flexible tissue found throughout the body – may become brittle and break, leading to joint and spinal damage. Joint replacement operations may be needed. Many people develop brown or black spots on the whites of their eyes. Another sign in many adults with alkaptonuria is thickening of ear cartilage. The cartilage may also look blue, grey or black. This is called ochronosis. The earwax may be black or reddish-brown. Alkaptonuria can result in discoloured sweat, which can stain clothes and cause some people to have blue or black speckled areas of skin. Nails may also turn a bluish or brownish colour. The skin colour changes are most obvious on areas exposed to the sun and where sweat glands are found – the cheeks, forehead, armpits and genital area. If the bones and muscles around the lungs become stiff, it can prevent the chest expanding and lead to shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Deposits of homogentisic acid around heart valves can cause them to narrow, harden and turn brittle and black. Blood vessels can also become stiff and weaken. This can lead to heart disease and may require heart valve replacements. The deposits can also lead to kidney stones, bladder stones and prostate stones. Each cell in the body contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. These carry the genes you inherit from your parents. One of each pair of chromosomes is inherited from each parent, which means (with the exception of the sex chromosomes) there are two copies of each gene in each cell. The gene involved in alkaptonuria is the HGD gene. This provides instructions for making an enzyme called homogentisate oxidase, which is needed to break down homogentisic acid. You need to inherit two copies of the faulty HGD gene (one from each parent) to develop alkaptonuria. The chances of this are slim, which is why the condition is very rare. The parents of a person with alkaptonuria will often only carry one copy of the faulty gene themselves, which means they will not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. Alkaptonuria is a lifelong condition. A medicine called nitisinone is used to slow the advance of alkaptonuria in adults. Painkillers and lifestyle changes may help you cope with the symptoms. Nitisinone reduces the level of homogentisic acid in the body. It’s offered at the National Alkaptonuria Centre, the treatment centre for all alkaptonuria patients, based at Royal Liverpool University Hospital. Find out about the National Alkaptonuria Centre and nitisinone treatment on the Alkaptonuria Society website A protein-controlled diet can be useful in reducing the risk of potential side effects when taking nitisinone for alkaptonuria during adulthood. Your doctor or dietitian will assess and advise you about this. If alkaptonuria causes pain and stiffness, you may think exercise will make your symptoms worse. But regular gentle exercise can actually help by building muscle and strengthening your joints. Exercise is also good for relieving stress, losing weight and improving your posture, all of which can ease your symptoms. But avoid exercise that puts additional strain on the joints, such as boxing, football and rugby. Gentle exercise such as yoga and pilates might help in the early stages, while cycling, walking and swimming may be more suitable for advanced alkaptonuria. Your GP or a physiotherapist can help you come up with a suitable exercise plan to follow at home. It's important to follow this plan as there's a risk the wrong sort of exercise may damage your joints. Speak to a doctor about painkillers and other techniques to manage pain. Find tips for managing your pain levels about with 10 ways to reduce pain. A diagnosis of alkaptonuria can be confusing and overwhelming at first. Like many people with a long-term health condition, those who find out they have alkaptonuria may feel anxious or depressed. But there are people you can talk to who can help. Talk to your GP if you feel you need support to cope with your illness. You could also visit the AKU Society website, a charity offering support to patients, their families and carers. Sometimes surgery may be necessary if joints are damaged and need replacing, or if heart valves or vessels have hardened. Your doctor may recommend: People with alkaptonuria have a normal life expectancy. However, they will eventually experience symptoms, such as pain and loss of movement in the joints and spine, which can affect quality of life. Working and carrying out strenuous physical activity will usually become very difficult, and eventually you may need mobility aids such as a wheelchair to get around. Visit the AKU Society website for more information and support. If you or your child have alkaptonuria, your clinical team will pass relevant patient information on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time. Find out more about the NCARDRS register on GOV.UK

"Alkaptonuria is a rare inherited genetic disease which is caused by a mutation in the HGD gene for the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.5); if a person inherits an abnormal copy from both parents (it is a recessive condition), the body accumulates an intermediate substance called homogentisic acid in the blood and tissues. Homogentisic acid and its oxidized form alkapton are excreted in the urine, giving it an unusually dark color. The accumulating homogentisic acid causes damage to cartilage (ochronosis, leading to osteoarthritis) and heart valves, as well as precipitating as kidney stones and stones in other organs. Symptoms usually develop in people over 30 years old, although the dark discoloration of the urine is present from birth.
 Apart from treatment of the complications (such as pain relief and joint replacement for the cartilage damage), the drug nitisinone has been found to suppress homogentisic acid production, and research is ongoing as to whether it can improve symptoms. Alkaptonuria is a rare disease; it occurs in one in 250,000 people, but is more common in Slovakia and the Dominican Republic.
 Patients with alkaptonuria are asymptomatic as children or young adults, but their urine may turn brown or even inky black if collected and left exposed to open air.[1] Pigmentation may be noted in the cartilage of the ear and other cartilage,[1][2] and the sclera and corneal limbus of the eye.[3]
 After the age of 30, people begin to develop pain in the weight-bearing joints of the spine, hips, and knees. The pain can be severe to the point that interferes with activities of daily living and may affect the ability to work. Joint-replacement surgery (hip and shoulder) is often necessary at a relatively young age.[1] In the longer term, the involvement of the spinal joints leads to reduced movement of the rib cage and can affect breathing.[1] Bone mineral density may be affected, increasing the risk of bone fractures, and rupture of tendons and muscles may occur.[1]
 Valvular heart disease, mainly calcification and regurgitation of the aortic and mitral valves, may occur, and in severe and progressive cases, valve replacement may be necessary. Irregularities in the heart rhythm and heart failure affect a significant proportion of people with alkaptonuria (40% and 10%, respectively).[1] Hearing loss affects 40% of people. Also, a propensity to developing kidney stones exists, and eventually also gallstones and stones in the prostate and salivary glands (sialolithiasis) can occur.[1]
 All people carry in their DNA two copies (one received from each parent) of the gene HGD, which contains the genetic information to produce the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) which can normally be found in numerous tissues in the body (liver, kidney, small intestine, colon, and prostate). In people with alkaptonuria, both copies of the gene contain abnormalities that mean that the body cannot produce an adequately functioning enzyme.[4] HGD mutations are generally found in certain parts (exons 6, 8, 10, and 13), but a total of over 100 abnormalities has been described throughout the gene.[4] The normal HGD enzyme is a hexamer (it has six subunits) that are organized in two groups of three (two trimers) and contains an iron atom. Different mutations may affect the structure, function, or solubility of the enzyme.[4] Very occasionally, the disease appears to be transmitted in an autosomal-dominant fashion, where a single abnormal copy of HGD from a single parent is associated with alkaptonuria;  other mechanisms or defects in other genes possibly are responsible in those cases.[4]
 The HGD enzyme is involved in the metabolism (chemical processing) of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine. Normally, these enter the bloodstream through protein-containing food and the natural turnover of protein in the body. Tyrosine is specifically required for a number of functions, such as hormones (e.g. thyroxine, the thyroid hormone), melanin (the dark pigment in the skin and hair), and certain proteins, but the vast majority (over 95%) is unused and is metabolized through a group of enzymes that eventually generate acetoacetate and malate.[1] In alkaptonuria, the HGD enzyme cannot metabolize the homogentisic acid (generated from tyrosine) into 4-maleylacetoacetate, and homogentisic acid levels in the blood are 100-fold higher than would normally be expected, despite the fact that a substantial amount is eliminated into the urine by the kidneys.[1]
 The homogentisic acid is converted to the related substance benzoquinone acetic acid  which forms polymers that resemble the skin pigment melanin. These are deposited in the collagen, a connective tissue protein, of particular tissues such as cartilage. This process is called ochronosis (as the tissue looks ochre); ochronotic tissue is stiffened and unusually brittle, impairing its normal function and causing damage.[1]
 If the diagnosis of alkaptonuria is suspected, it can be confirmed or excluded by collecting urine for 24 hours and determining the amount of homogentisic acid by means of chromatography. No assay of HGA in blood has been validated.[1] The Genetic Testing Registry  is used for maintaining information about the genetic test for alkaptonuria.[5]
 The severity of the symptoms and response to treatment can be quantified through a validated questionnaire titled the AKU Severity Score Index. This  assigns scores to the presence of particular symptoms and features, such as the presence of eye and skin pigmentation, joint pain, heart problems, and organ stones.[1]
 In 2012 the AKU Society formed a consortium called DevelopAKUre to prove that nitisinone, a drug already approved for treating another rare disease, hereditary tyrosinaemia type-1, could be repurposed to treat AKU.
 The DevelopAKUre trials concluded in 2019 and successfully illustrated that nitisinone lowered levels of homogentisic acid (HGA), the acid that causes the damage in AKU, by 99% which effectively halts the progression of the disease. In 2020, the European Medicines Agency and the European Commission approved the use of nitisinone for treating AKU making the treatment available to patients across the Europe and the UK.
 Nitisinone has revolutionised the treatment of AKU, however it can lead to a condition known as hypertyrosinaemia[6] caused by elevated levels of the amino acid tyrosine. Hypertyrosinaemia can lead to serious symptoms including corneal keratopathy,[7] dermal toxicity,[8]  neurodevelopment delay issues in children,[9] and alterations of wider metabolism.[10] There is currently no effective treatment for hypertyrosinaemia other than limiting protein intake. Due to the potential side-effects of nitisinone treatment it is currently only prescribed to children aged 16 and above in Europe and patients will then have to follow a protein restricted diet and closely manage their tyrosine levels through frequent monitoring.
 The AKU Society is a charity which support all people affected by AKU. Based in the UK, the charity can be contacted here. It has a number of international AKU sister societies who provide support across the world and can be accessed here.
 The AKU Society works to provide information, education, support, and helps people to access treatment for their condition. A number of support resources are available here and they have also been translated into all major languages here.
 As part of the DevelopAKUre consortium, the AKU Society successfully proved the effectiveness of nitisinone to treat AKU, leading to the drug receiving approval from the European Medicines Agency in 2020. The AKU Society continues to drive research into developing potential treatments and cures for AKU working closely with a number of universities across the world.
 Alkaptonuria does not appear to affect life expectancy, although the latest study on the topic is from 1985.[1] The main impact is on quality of life; many people with alkaptonuria have disabling symptoms such as pain, poor sleep, and breathing symptoms. These generally start in the fourth decade. The typical age at requiring joint replacement surgery is 50–55 years.[1]
 In most ethnic groups, the prevalence of alkaptonuria is between 1:100,000 and 1:250,000.[4] In Slovakia and the Dominican Republic, the disease is much more common, with prevalence estimated at 1:19,000 people.[4] As for Slovakia, this is not the result of a single mutation, but due to a group of 12 mutations in specific ""hot spots"" of the HGD gene.[4] The Slovakian clustering probably arose in a small area in the northwest of the country and spread after the 1950s due to migration.[4]
 Alkaptonuria was one of the four diseases described by Archibald Edward Garrod, as being the result of the accumulation of intermediates due to metabolic deficiencies. He linked ochronosis with the accumulation of alkaptans in 1902,[4][11] and his views on the subject, including its mode of heritance, were summarized in a 1908 Croonian Lecture at the Royal College of Physicians.[4][12][13] The genetics of it was also studied by William Bateson in the 1902.[14]
 The defect was narrowed down to homogentisic acid oxidase deficiency in a study published in 1958.[4][15] The genetic basis was elucidated in 1996, when HGD mutations were demonstrated.[4][16]
 A 1977 study showed that an ochronotic Egyptian mummy had probably suffered from alkaptonuria.[17][18]
 Research collaborations by several national centres have been established to find a more definitive treatment for alkaptonuria. This has included studies on the use of nitisinone and investigations into antioxidants to inhibit ochronosis.[4] The ideal treatment would replace HGD enzyme function without accumulating other substances.[1]

"Alkaptonuria is a lifelong condition, but there are many ways to help manage your symptoms.  Alkaptonuria is a rare inherited disorder. It occurs when your body can’t produce enough of an enzyme called homogentisic dioxygenase (HGD). This enzyme is used to break down a toxic substance called homogentisic acid.  When you don’t produce enough HGD, homogentisic acid builds up in your body. The buildup of homogentisic acid causes your bones and cartilage to become discolored and brittle.  This typically leads to osteoarthritis, especially in your spine and large joints. People with alkaptonuria also have urine that turns dark brown or black when it’s exposed to air. Dark stains on a baby’s diaper are one of the earliest signs of alkaptonuria. There are few other symptoms during childhood. Symptoms become more obvious as you age.  Your urine may turn dark brown or black when it’s exposed to air. By the time you reach your 20s or 30s, you may notice signs of early-onset osteoarthritis. For example, you may notice chronic stiffness or pain in your lower back or large joints. Other symptoms of alkaptonuria include: Alkaptonuria can also lead to heart problems. The buildup of homogentisic acid causes your heart valves to harden. This can keep them from closing properly, resulting in aortic and mitral valve disorders.  In severe cases, heart valve replacement may be necessary. The buildup also causes your blood vessels to harden. This raises your risk of high blood pressure. Alkaptonuria is caused by a mutation on your homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) gene. It’s an autosomally recessive condition. This means that both of your parents must have the gene in order to pass the condition on to you.  Alkaptonuria is a rare disease. According to the National Institutes of Health, the condition affects about 1 in 250,000 to 1 million people worldwide, but is more common in Slovakia and the Dominican Republic, affecting about 1 in 19,000 people.  Your doctor may suspect you have alkaptonuria if your urine turns dark brown or black when it’s exposed to air. They may also test you for the condition if you develop early onset osteoarthritis. Your doctor can use a test called gas chromatography to look for traces of homogentisic acid in your urine. They can also use DNA testing to check for the mutated HGD gene. Family history is very useful in making a diagnosis of alkaptonuria. However, many people don’t know they carry the gene. Your parents might be carriers without realizing it. There’s no specific treatment for alkaptonuria. Instead, treatment is focused largely on managing symptoms. There are many therapies that have been tried, but unfortunately they haven’t been proven to be effective, and may be harmful or unhelpful in the long term. However, The National Institutes of Health warns that long-term use of vitamin C can sometimes increase the production of kidney stones and has generally proven ineffective for long-term treatment of this condition. Other treatments for alkaptonuria are focused on preventing and relieving possible complications, such as: For example, your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory medications or narcotics for joint pain. Physical and occupational therapy may help you maintain flexibility and strength in your muscles and joints.  You should also avoid activities that put a lot of strain on your joints, such as heavy manual labor and contact sports. At some point in your life, you might need surgery.  The World Institutes of Health reports adults can experience a buildup of homogentisic acid in cartilage, resulting in arthritis. As a result those with alkaptonuria may need a shoulder, knee, or hip replacement.  You may also require surgery to replace your aortic or mitral heart valves, if they stop working properly. In some cases, you may need surgery or other therapies to treat chronic kidney or prostate stones. The life expectancy for people with alkaptonuria is fairly normal. However, the disease puts you at much higher risk of certain disorders, including: Some of these complications can be delayed with regular checkups. Your doctor will want to monitor you regularly. Tests to monitor the progress of your condition might include: Share this article Learn about phthisis bulbi and its possible treatment options.

"An allergy occurs when the body overreacts to an allergen or ‘trigger’ that is typically harmless to most people. Examples of allergies include: The symptoms of allergy range from mild to severe. The most severe type of allergic reaction is anaphylaxis, which may cause death without prompt administration of adrenaline (epinephrine). For mild allergies, effective treatments are available to manage or treat allergy symptoms.  Symptoms depend on the allergy, but may include: Do not self-diagnose. The symptoms and signs of allergies are common to many other medical conditions. It is important to see your doctor or clinical immunology/allergy specialist for professional diagnosis, management and treatment. A substance in the environment that can cause an allergic reaction in susceptible people is called an ‘allergen’. There are many different allergens, but they all share one thing in common – protein. Some allergens don’t contain protein to begin with, but bind with protein once inside the body to provoke the allergic reaction. 
Common allergens include:  Allergy is the result of mistaken identity. An allergen enters the body and is wrongly identified by the immune system as a dangerous substance. In response, the immune system makes antibodies to attack the allergen. These are specific antibodies of the IgE (immunoglobulin E) class. 
When an allergen is found, IgE antibodies trigger a cascade of immune system reactions, including the release of chemicals known as mast cell chemicals. These are substances that the body normally uses to destroy micro-organisms. The most common of these is histamine. In small amounts, histamine causes itching and reddening of the local area. In large amounts, the nearby blood vessels become dilated and the area swells with accumulated fluid.
The immune system’s tendency to overreact to a harmless substance is thought to be genetic. The term ‘atopy’ describes this genetic tendency. Doctors and clinical immunology/allergy specialists describe a person who has an allergy as being ‘atopic’ – such people usually have raised levels of IgE in their blood.

"Allergies occur when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance — such as pollen, bee venom or pet dander — or a food that doesn't cause a reaction in most people. Your immune system produces substances known as antibodies. When you have allergies, your immune system makes antibodies that identify a particular allergen as harmful, even though it isn't. When you come into contact with the allergen, your immune system's reaction can inflame your skin, sinuses, airways or digestive system. The severity of allergies varies from person to person and can range from minor irritation to anaphylaxis — a potentially life-threatening emergency. While most allergies can't be cured, treatments can help relieve your allergy symptoms. Allergy symptoms, which depend on the substance involved, can affect your airways, sinuses and nasal passages, skin, and digestive system. Allergic reactions can range from mild to severe. In some severe cases, allergies can trigger a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis. Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis, can cause: A food allergy can cause: An insect sting allergy can cause: A drug allergy can cause: Atopic dermatitis, an allergic skin condition also called eczema, can cause skin to: Some types of allergies, including allergies to foods and insect stings, can trigger a severe reaction known as anaphylaxis. A life-threatening medical emergency, anaphylaxis can cause you to go into shock. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include: You might see your health care provider if you have symptoms you think are caused by an allergy, and nonprescription allergy medications don't provide enough relief. If you have symptoms after starting a new medication, call the provider who prescribed it right away. For a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), call 911 or your local emergency number or seek emergency medical help. If you carry an epinephrine auto-injector (Auvi-Q, EpiPen, others), give yourself a shot right away. Even if your symptoms improve after an epinephrine injection, you should go to the emergency department to make sure symptoms don't return when the effects of the injection wear off. If you've had a severe allergy attack or any signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis in the past, make an appointment to see your health care provider. Evaluation, diagnosis and long-term management of anaphylaxis are complicated, so you'll probably need to see a provider who specializes in allergies and immunology. There is a problem with

"Allergies are your body’s reaction to normally harmless substances. Allergy symptoms range from mild to life-threatening. Treatments include antihistamines, decongestants, nasal steroids, asthma medicines and immunotherapy. Allergies are your body’s reaction to a foreign protein. Usually, these proteins (allergens) are harmless. However, if you have an allergy to a particular protein, your body’s defense system (immune system) overreacts to its presence in your body. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy An allergic reaction is the way your body responds to an allergen. If you have allergies, the first time you encounter a specific allergen, your body responds by creating immunoglobulin E (IgE). Your immune system makes antibodies to form IgE. IgE antibodies bind to mast cells (allergy cells) that live in your skin, respiratory tract (airways) and the mucus membrane in the hollow organs that connect to each other from your mouth to your anus (gastrointestinal or GI tract). The antibodies find the allergens in your body and help remove them by taking them to the mast cell (allergy cell), where they attach to a special receptor. This causes the allergy cell to release histamine. Histamine is what causes your allergy symptoms. Allergies are very common. More than 50 million people in the United States have an allergic reaction each year. They’re the sixth-leading cause of long-term illness in the United States. Allergies can affect anyone. You’re more likely to have or develop allergies if your biological parents have allergies. The most common allergies include: Food allergies develop when your body releases a specific antibody to a particular food. An allergic reaction occurs within minutes of eating the food, and symptoms can be severe. Symptoms may include: If you have an IgE-mediated food allergy, symptoms may also include anaphylaxis. It may present as any one of the above symptoms or a combination of the above symptoms. It usually occurs within 30 minutes of ingesting a food you’re allergic to. In adults, the most common food allergies are: In children, the most common food allergies are: Inhalant allergies are airborne substances that you inhale (breathe in). They include allergens that may affect you throughout the year (perennial allergens) and seasonal allergens. Inhalant allergy symptoms include: If you have asthma, inhalant allergies can also trigger or worsen your symptoms, including wheezing and shortness of breath. Perennial allergens include: Seasonal allergies include pollens. Pollen is microspores from trees, grass or weeds that appear as a fine dust on surfaces or float in the air. Tree pollens generally appear in the spring, while weed pollens generally appear in the fall. Certain medications can cause an allergic reaction. The medicines may be herbal, over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription. Common medications that cause allergies include: Symptoms include: Latex allergies develop after repeated contact with natural rubber latex. Common natural rubber latex products include: The most common reaction to latex is skin irritation (contact dermatitis). It manifests as a rash on the area of skin that touched the latex. It may develop within minutes of exposure to latex. Other symptoms may include: Stinging insects can inject venom, which is a toxic substance. The venom in insect stings can cause an allergic reaction. The most common stinging insects that cause allergic reactions include: Venom symptoms are consistent with anaphylaxis. They may include: No, allergies can’t cause a fever. Advertisement Allergies develop when your immune system reacts to a foreign substance or protein. No, allergies aren’t contagious. You can’t spread your allergies to another person. If you think you have allergies, don’t wait to see if your symptoms go away. If your symptoms last longer than a week or two or tend to come back during certain times of the year, make an appointment with an allergist. An allergist is a healthcare provider who specializes in allergies. They can help diagnose your allergies through tests. Advertisement There are different types of allergy tests. The most common allergy tests are skin prick tests and blood tests. Skin prick (scratch) tests can identify the allergens that cause your allergy symptoms. An allergist will use a thin needle to prick your skin with a tiny amount of different possible allergens. They then check to see if your skin reacts to the allergen. Blood (IgE) tests can also identify allergies. However, they’re not as sensitive as skin prick tests. Blood tests evaluate IgE antibodies that your immune system produces against a specific protein. Avoiding allergens is an important treatment approach. However, it often doesn’t completely end allergic reactions. Over-the-counter and prescription allergy medications are also a solution to managing your allergies. These may include: These medications are very effective and safe to use daily but they may take a few days to a week to kick in. These medications should be used cautiously when treating allergies due to higher side effects and concerns related to long-term use. A healthcare provider may recommend immunotherapy (allergy shots) and/or sublingual immunotherapy (allergy drops) if you can’t manage your allergy symptoms through over-the-counter and prescription medications and avoiding allergens. The provider will expose you to small amounts of allergens and gradually increase the dosage over several months. Gradual exposure creates a tolerance to the allergen. A neti pot is an over-the-counter device that pushes a saline (salt) solution through your nasal passages. It helps clear out mucus and allergens trapped inside your nasal passages. Nasal steroid sprays are generally the most effective medication for people with allergic rhinitis symptoms. Antihistamines block some of the effects of histamine and may offer additional benefits. Immunotherapy helps create a tolerance to allergens and can improve many of the symptoms related to inhalant allergy exposure. Remember, your body is unique. What over-the-counter or prescription medications work for one person may not work well for you. Talk to a healthcare provider. They can help recommend the best treatment for you. If you have food allergies, avoid any products that contain the allergens. By law, manufacturers must include all ingredients on the label of packaged foods for sale in the United States. You should also consider other possible food allergy exposures. Some nonfood items may contain food allergens, and labeling laws don’t apply to nonfood items. During the manufacturing process, some food items share equipment or surfaces. Look for labels that state whether the product shared equipment with possible food allergens. The best way to prevent allergies is to avoid allergens. You can also take antihistamines or other medications daily to help control your symptoms and reduce your allergic reaction. If you have animal allergies, avoid petting, hugging or kissing animals. Don’t allow them in your bedroom or on your furniture. Regularly vacuuming rugs, carpets and other surfaces helps remove dust, animal dander, pollen and other allergens. High-efficiency particulate (HEPA) air filters can also help. These air purifiers remove airborne allergens from your environment. Living with allergies can be challenging. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. However, with caution, you can lead a fulfilling life. Your healthcare provider can recommend resources, support groups and specialists to help you. Your allergies will last as long as your allergen exposure. Once you’re no longer around allergens, your symptoms should go away after a few hours. However, if you have inhalant allergies, your symptoms may last for several days or longer due to ongoing exposure to pets, dust mites and pollens. Yes, some children can outgrow their allergies. However, it depends on the type of allergy and the severity of your child’s allergy. Go to the ER or call 911 immediately if you start showing symptoms of anaphylaxis. A cold is a contagious upper respiratory infection. Viruses cause colds. Allergies are your immune system’s response to an allergen. Viruses aren’t allergens. A cold shares many of the same symptoms as allergies. These include sneezing, runny nose, cough and congestion. However, there are differences between cold symptoms and allergy symptoms. A note from Cleveland Clinic Allergies occur when your immune system mistakenly triggers an allergic reaction to an allergen. Allergic reaction symptoms include congestion, watery eyes, a runny nose, vomiting and, in severe cases, anaphylaxis. Allergies can be incredibly frustrating if you don’t know what’s triggering your immune system. However, a healthcare provider can help provide relief. They can conduct tests to pinpoint your allergies and prescribe medications. They can also refer you to specialists or support groups. Last reviewed on 12/21/2022.

 Allergies, also known as allergic diseases, are various conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment.[11] These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis.[1] Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, coughing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling.[12] Note that food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions.[3][4]
 Common allergens include pollen and certain foods.[11] Metals and other substances may also cause such problems.[11] Food, insect stings, and medications are common causes of severe reactions.[2] Their development is due to both genetic and environmental factors.[2] The underlying mechanism involves immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binding to an allergen and then to a receptor on mast cells or basophils where it triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine.[13] Diagnosis is typically based on a person's medical history.[3] Further testing of the skin or blood may be useful in certain cases.[3] Positive tests, however, may not necessarily mean there is a significant allergy to the substance in question.[14]
 Early exposure of children to potential allergens may be protective.[5] Treatments for allergies include avoidance of known allergens and the use of medications such as steroids and antihistamines.[6] In severe reactions, injectable adrenaline (epinephrine) is recommended.[7] Allergen immunotherapy, which gradually exposes people to larger and larger amounts of allergen, is useful for some types of allergies such as hay fever and reactions to insect bites.[6] Its use in food allergies is unclear.[6]
 Allergies are common.[10] In the developed world, about 20% of people are affected by allergic rhinitis,[15] about 6% of people have at least one food allergy,[3][5] and about 20% have or have had atopic dermatitis at some point in time.[16] Depending on the country, about 1–18% of people have asthma.[17][18] Anaphylaxis occurs in between 0.05–2% of people.[19] Rates of many allergic diseases appear to be increasing.[7][20][21] The word ""allergy"" was first used by Clemens von Pirquet in 1906.[2]
 Many allergens such as dust or pollen are airborne particles. In these cases, symptoms arise in areas in contact with air, such as the eyes, nose, and lungs. For instance, allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, causes irritation of the nose, sneezing, itching, and redness of the eyes.[22] Inhaled allergens can also lead to increased production of mucus in the lungs, shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing.[23]
 Aside from these ambient allergens, allergic reactions can result from foods, insect stings, and reactions to medications like aspirin and antibiotics such as penicillin. Symptoms of food allergy include abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, itchy skin, and hives. Food allergies rarely cause respiratory (asthmatic) reactions, or rhinitis.[24] Insect stings, food, antibiotics, and certain medicines may produce a systemic allergic response that is also called anaphylaxis; multiple organ systems can be affected, including the digestive system, the respiratory system, and the circulatory system.[25][26][27] Depending on the severity, anaphylaxis can include skin reactions, bronchoconstriction, swelling, low blood pressure, coma, and death. This type of reaction can be triggered suddenly, or the onset can be delayed. The nature of anaphylaxis is such that the reaction can seem to be subsiding but may recur throughout a period of time.[27]
 Substances that come into contact with the skin, such as latex, are also common causes of allergic reactions, known as contact dermatitis or eczema.[28] Skin allergies frequently cause rashes, or swelling and inflammation within the skin, in what is known as a ""weal and flare"" reaction characteristic of hives and angioedema.[29]
 With insect stings, a large local reaction may occur in the form of an area of skin redness greater than 10 cm in size that can last one to two days.[30] This reaction may also occur after immunotherapy.[31]
 Risk factors for allergies can be placed in two broad categories, namely host and environmental factors.[32] Host factors include heredity, sex, race, and age, with heredity being by far the most significant. However, there has been a recent increase in the incidence of allergic disorders that cannot be explained by genetic factors alone. Four major environmental candidates are alterations in exposure to infectious diseases during early childhood, environmental pollution, allergen levels, and dietary changes.[33]
 Dust mite allergy, also known as house dust allergy, is a sensitization and allergic reaction to the droppings of house dust mites. The allergy is common[34][35] and can trigger allergic reactions such as asthma, eczema, or itching. It is the manifestation of parasitosis. The mite's gut contains potent digestive enzymes (notably peptidase 1) that persist in their feces and are major inducers of allergic reactions such as wheezing. The mite's exoskeleton can also contribute to allergic reactions. Unlike scabies mites or skin follicle mites, house dust mites do not burrow under the skin and are not parasitic.[36]
 A wide variety of foods can cause allergic reactions, but 90% of allergic responses to foods are caused by cow's milk, soy, eggs, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish.[37] Other food allergies, affecting less than 1 person per 10,000 population, may be considered ""rare"".[38] The most common food allergy in the US population is a sensitivity to crustacea.[38] Although peanut allergies are notorious for their severity, peanut allergies are not the most common food allergy in adults or children. Severe or life-threatening reactions may be triggered by other allergens and are more common when combined with asthma.[37]
 Rates of allergies differ between adults and children. Children can sometimes outgrow peanut allergies. Egg allergies affect one to two percent of children but are outgrown by about two-thirds of children by the age of 5.[39] The sensitivity is usually to proteins in the white, rather than the yolk.[40]
 Milk-protein allergies—distinct from lactose intolerance—are most common in children.[41] Approximately 60% of milk-protein reactions are immunoglobulin E–mediated, with the remaining usually attributable to inflammation of the colon.[42] Some people are unable to tolerate milk from goats or sheep as well as from cows, and many are also unable to tolerate dairy products such as cheese. Roughly 10% of children with a milk allergy will have a reaction to beef.[43] Lactose intolerance, a common reaction to milk, is not a form of allergy at all, but due to the absence of an enzyme in the digestive tract.[44]
 Those with tree nut allergies may be allergic to one or to many tree nuts, including pecans, pistachios, pine nuts, and walnuts.[40] In addition, seeds, including sesame seeds and poppy seeds, contain oils in which protein is present, which may elicit an allergic reaction.[40]
 Allergens can be transferred from one food to another through genetic engineering; however genetic modification can also remove allergens. Little research has been done on the natural variation of allergen concentrations in unmodified crops.[45][46]
 Latex can trigger an IgE-mediated cutaneous, respiratory, and systemic reaction. The prevalence of latex allergy in the general population is believed to be less than one percent. In a hospital study, 1 in 800 surgical patients (0.125 percent) reported latex sensitivity, although the sensitivity among healthcare workers is higher, between seven and ten percent. Researchers attribute this higher level to the exposure of healthcare workers to areas with significant airborne latex allergens, such as operating rooms, intensive-care units, and dental suites. These latex-rich environments may sensitize healthcare workers who regularly inhale allergenic proteins.[47]
 The most prevalent response to latex is an allergic contact dermatitis, a delayed hypersensitive reaction appearing as dry, crusted lesions. This reaction usually lasts 48–96 hours. Sweating or rubbing the area under the glove aggravates the lesions, possibly leading to ulcerations.[47] Anaphylactic reactions occur most often in sensitive patients who have been exposed to a surgeon's latex gloves during abdominal surgery, but other mucosal exposures, such as dental procedures, can also produce systemic reactions.[47]
 Latex and banana sensitivity may cross-react.  Furthermore, those with latex allergy may also have sensitivities to avocado, kiwifruit, and chestnut.[48] These people often have perioral itching and local urticaria. Only occasionally have these food-induced allergies induced systemic responses. Researchers suspect that the cross-reactivity of latex with banana, avocado, kiwifruit, and chestnut occurs because latex proteins are structurally homologous with some other plant proteins.[47]
 About 10% of people report that they are allergic to penicillin; however, of that 10%, 90% turn out not to be.[49] Serious allergies only occur in about 0.03%.[49]
 One of the main sources of human allergies is insects. An allergy to insects can be brought on by bites, stings, ingestion, and inhalation.[50]
 Another non-food protein reaction, urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, originates after contact with poison ivy, eastern poison oak, western poison oak, or poison sumac. Urushiol, which is not itself a protein, acts as a hapten and chemically reacts with, binds to, and changes the shape of integral membrane proteins on exposed skin cells. The immune system does not recognize the affected cells as normal parts of the body, causing a T-cell-mediated immune response.[51] Of these poisonous plants, sumac is the most virulent.[52][53] The resulting dermatological response to the reaction between urushiol and membrane proteins includes redness, swelling, papules, vesicles, blisters, and streaking.[54]
 Estimates vary on the population fraction that will have an immune system response. Approximately 25% of the population will have a strong allergic response to urushiol. In general, approximately 80–90% of adults will develop a rash if they are exposed to 0.0050 mg (7.7×10−5 gr) of purified urushiol, but some people are so sensitive that it takes only a molecular trace on the skin to initiate an allergic reaction.[55]
 Allergic diseases are strongly familial: identical twins are likely to have the same allergic diseases about 70% of the time; the same allergy occurs about 40% of the time in non-identical twins.[56] Allergic parents are more likely to have allergic children,[57] and those children's allergies are likely to be more severe than those in children of non-allergic parents. Some allergies, however, are not consistent along genealogies; parents who are allergic to peanuts may have children who are allergic to ragweed. The likelihood of developing allergies is inherited and related to an irregularity in the immune system, but the specific allergen is not.[57]
 The risk of allergic sensitization and the development of allergies varies with age, with young children most at risk.[58] Several studies have shown that IgE levels are highest in childhood and fall rapidly between the ages of 10 and 30 years.[58] The peak prevalence of hay fever is highest in children and young adults and the incidence of asthma is highest in children under 10.[59]
 Ethnicity may play a role in some allergies; however, racial factors have been difficult to separate from environmental influences and changes due to migration.[57] It has been suggested that different genetic loci are responsible for asthma, to be specific, in people of European, Hispanic, Asian, and African origins.[60]
 Allergic diseases are caused by inappropriate immunological responses to harmless antigens driven by a TH2-mediated immune response. Many bacteria and viruses elicit a TH1-mediated immune response, which down-regulates TH2 responses. The first proposed mechanism of action of the hygiene hypothesis was that insufficient stimulation of the TH1 arm of the immune system leads to an overactive TH2 arm, which in turn leads to allergic disease.[61] In other words, individuals living in too sterile an environment are not exposed to enough pathogens to keep the immune system busy. Since our bodies evolved to deal with a certain level of such pathogens, when they are not exposed to this level, the immune system will attack harmless antigens, and thus normally benign microbial objects—like pollen—will trigger an immune response.[62]
 The hygiene hypothesis was developed to explain the observation that hay fever and eczema, both allergic diseases, were less common in children from larger families, which were, it is presumed, exposed to more infectious agents through their siblings, than in children from families with only one child.[63] It is used to explain the increase in allergic diseases that have been seen since industrialization, and the higher incidence of allergic diseases in more developed countries.[64] The hygiene hypothesis has now expanded to include exposure to symbiotic bacteria and parasites as important modulators of immune system development, along with infectious agents.[65]
 Epidemiological data support the hygiene hypothesis. Studies have shown that various immunological and autoimmune diseases are much less common in the developing world than the industrialized world, and that immigrants to the industrialized world from the developing world increasingly develop immunological disorders in relation to the length of time since arrival in the industrialized world.[66] Longitudinal studies in the third world demonstrate an increase in immunological disorders as a country grows more affluent and, it is presumed, cleaner.[67] The use of antibiotics in the first year of life has been linked to asthma and other allergic diseases.[68] The use of antibacterial cleaning products has also been associated with higher incidence of asthma, as has birth by caesarean section rather than vaginal birth.[69][70]
 Chronic stress can aggravate allergic conditions. This has been attributed to a T helper 2 (TH2)-predominant response driven by suppression of interleukin 12 by both the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Stress management in highly susceptible individuals may improve symptoms.[71]
 Allergic diseases are more common in industrialized countries than in countries that are more traditional or agricultural, and there is a higher rate of allergic disease in urban populations versus rural populations, although these differences are becoming less defined.[72] Historically, the trees planted in urban areas were predominantly male to prevent litter from seeds and fruits, but the high ratio of male trees causes high pollen counts, a phenomenon that horticulturist Tom Ogren has called ""botanical sexism"".[73]
 Alterations in exposure to microorganisms is another plausible explanation, at present, for the increase in atopic allergy.[33] Endotoxin exposure reduces release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IFNγ, interleukin-10, and interleukin-12 from white blood cells (leukocytes) that circulate in the blood.[74] Certain microbe-sensing proteins, known as Toll-like receptors, found on the surface of cells in the body are also thought to be involved in these processes.[75]
 Parasitic worms and similar parasites are present in untreated drinking water in developing countries, and were present in the water of developed countries until the routine chlorination and purification of drinking water supplies.[76] Recent research has shown that some common parasites, such as intestinal worms (e.g., hookworms), secrete chemicals into the gut wall (and, hence, the bloodstream) that suppress the immune system and prevent the body from attacking the parasite.[77] This gives rise to a new slant on the hygiene hypothesis theory—that co-evolution of humans and parasites has led to an immune system that functions correctly only in the presence of the parasites. Without them, the immune system becomes unbalanced and oversensitive.[78] In particular, research suggests that allergies may coincide with the delayed establishment of gut flora in infants.[79] However, the research to support this theory is conflicting, with some studies performed in China and Ethiopia showing an increase in allergy in people infected with intestinal worms.[72] Clinical trials have been initiated to test the effectiveness of certain worms in treating some allergies.[80] It may be that the term 'parasite' could turn out to be inappropriate, and in fact a hitherto unsuspected symbiosis is at work.[80] For more information on this topic, see Helminthic therapy.
 In the initial stages of allergy, a type I hypersensitivity reaction against an allergen encountered for the first time and presented by a professional antigen-presenting cell causes a response in a type of immune cell called a TH2 lymphocyte, a subset of T cells that produce a cytokine called interleukin-4 (IL-4). These TH2 cells interact with other lymphocytes called B cells, whose role is production of antibodies. Coupled with signals provided by IL-4, this interaction stimulates the B cell to begin production of a large amount of a particular type of antibody known as IgE. Secreted IgE circulates in the blood and binds to an IgE-specific receptor (a kind of Fc receptor called FcεRI) on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called mast cells and basophils, which are both involved in the acute inflammatory response. The IgE-coated cells, at this stage, are sensitized to the allergen.[33]
 If later exposure to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held on the surface of the mast cells or basophils. Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule and activates the sensitized cell. Activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called degranulation, during which they release histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators (cytokines, interleukins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) from their granules into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as vasodilation, mucous secretion, nerve stimulation, and smooth muscle contraction. This results in rhinorrhea, itchiness, dyspnea, and anaphylaxis. Depending on the individual, allergen, and mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis) or localized to specific body systems. Asthma is localized to the respiratory system and eczema is localized to the dermis.[33]
 After the chemical mediators of the acute response subside, late-phase responses can often occur. This is due to the migration of other leukocytes such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages to the initial site. The reaction is usually seen 2–24 hours after the original reaction.[81] Cytokines from mast cells may play a role in the persistence of long-term effects. Late-phase responses seen in asthma are slightly different from those seen in other allergic responses, although they are still caused by release of mediators from eosinophils and are still dependent on activity of TH2 cells.[82]
 Although allergic contact dermatitis is termed an ""allergic"" reaction (which usually refers to type I hypersensitivity), its pathophysiology involves a reaction that more correctly corresponds to a type IV hypersensitivity reaction.[83] In type IV hypersensitivity, there is activation of certain types of T cells (CD8+) that destroy target cells on contact, as well as activated macrophages that produce hydrolytic enzymes.[84]
 Effective management of allergic diseases relies on the ability to make an accurate diagnosis.[85] Allergy testing can help confirm or rule out allergies.[86][87] Correct diagnosis, counseling, and avoidance advice based on valid allergy test results reduce the incidence of symptoms and need for medications, and improve quality of life.[86] To assess the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, two different methods can be used: a skin prick test, or an allergy blood test. Both methods are recommended, and they have similar diagnostic value.[87][88]
 Skin prick tests and blood tests are equally cost-effective, and health economic evidence shows that both tests were cost-effective compared with no test.[86] Early and more accurate diagnoses save cost due to reduced consultations, referrals to secondary care, misdiagnosis, and emergency admissions.[89]
 Allergy undergoes dynamic changes over time. Regular allergy testing of relevant allergens provides information on if and how patient management can be changed to improve health and quality of life. Annual testing is often the practice for determining whether allergy to milk, egg, soy, and wheat have been outgrown, and the testing interval is extended to 2–3 years for allergy to peanut, tree nuts, fish, and crustacean shellfish.[87] Results of follow-up testing can guide decision-making regarding whether and when it is safe to introduce or re-introduce allergenic food into the diet.[90]
 Skin testing is also known as ""puncture testing"" and ""prick testing"" due to the series of tiny punctures or pricks made into the patient's skin. Tiny amounts of suspected allergens and/or their extracts (e.g., pollen, grass, mite proteins, peanut extract) are introduced to sites on the skin marked with pen or dye (the ink/dye should be carefully selected, lest it cause an allergic response itself). A negative and positive control are also included for comparison (eg, negative is saline or glycerin; positive is histamine). A small plastic or metal device is used to puncture or prick the skin. Sometimes, the allergens are injected ""intradermally"" into the patient's skin, with a needle and syringe. Common areas for testing include the inside forearm and the back.
 If the patient is allergic to the substance, then a visible inflammatory reaction will usually occur within 30 minutes. This response will range from slight reddening of the skin to a full-blown hive (called ""wheal and flare"") in more sensitive patients similar to a mosquito bite. Interpretation of the results of the skin prick test is normally done by allergists on a scale of severity, with +/− meaning borderline reactivity, and 4+ being a large reaction. Increasingly, allergists are measuring and recording the diameter of the wheal and flare reaction. Interpretation by well-trained allergists is often guided by relevant literature.[91] In general, a positive response is interpreted when the wheal of an antigen is ≥3mm larger than the wheal of the negative control (eg, saline or glycerin).[92] Some patients may believe they have determined their own allergic sensitivity from observation, but a skin test has been shown to be much better than patient observation to detect allergy.[93]
 If a serious life-threatening anaphylactic reaction has brought a patient in for evaluation, some allergists will prefer an initial blood test prior to performing the skin prick test. Skin tests may not be an option if the patient has widespread skin disease or has taken antihistamines in the last several days.
 Patch testing is a method used to determine if a specific substance causes allergic inflammation of the skin. It tests for delayed reactions. It is used to help ascertain the cause of skin contact allergy or contact dermatitis. Adhesive patches, usually treated with several common allergic chemicals or skin sensitizers, are applied to the back. The skin is then examined for possible local reactions at least twice, usually at 48 hours after application of the patch, and again two or three days later.
 An allergy blood test is quick and simple and can be ordered by a licensed health care provider (e.g., an allergy specialist) or general practitioner. Unlike skin-prick testing, a blood test can be performed irrespective of age, skin condition, medication, symptom, disease activity, and pregnancy. Adults and children of any age can get an allergy blood test. For babies and very young children, a single needle stick for allergy blood testing is often gentler than several skin pricks.
 An allergy blood test is available through most laboratories. A sample of the patient's blood is sent to a laboratory for analysis, and the results are sent back a few days later. Multiple allergens can be detected with a single blood sample. Allergy blood tests are very safe since the person is not exposed to any allergens during the testing procedure.
 The test measures the concentration of specific IgE antibodies in the blood. Quantitative IgE test results increase the possibility of ranking how different substances may affect symptoms. A rule of thumb is that the higher the IgE antibody value, the greater the likelihood of symptoms. Allergens found at low levels that today do not result in symptoms cannot help predict future symptom development. The quantitative allergy blood result can help determine what a patient is allergic to, help predict and follow the disease development, estimate the risk of a severe reaction, and explain cross-reactivity.[94][95]
 A low total IgE level is not adequate to rule out sensitization to commonly inhaled allergens.[96] Statistical methods, such as ROC curves, predictive value calculations, and likelihood ratios have been used to examine the relationship of various testing methods to each other. These methods have shown that patients with a high total IgE have a high probability of allergic sensitization, but further investigation with allergy tests for specific IgE antibodies for a carefully chosen of allergens is often warranted.
 Laboratory methods to measure specific IgE antibodies for allergy testing include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, or EIA),[97] radioallergosorbent test (RAST),[97] fluorescent enzyme immunoassay (FEIA), [98] and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA).[99][100]
 Challenge testing: Challenge testing is when tiny amounts of a suspected allergen are introduced to the body orally, through inhalation, or via other routes. Except for testing food and medication allergies, challenges are rarely performed. When this type of testing is chosen, it must be closely supervised by an allergist.
 Elimination/challenge tests: This testing method is used most often with foods or medicines. A patient with a suspected allergen is instructed to modify his diet to totally avoid that allergen for a set time. If the patient experiences significant improvement, he may then be ""challenged"" by reintroducing the allergen, to see if symptoms are reproduced.
 Unreliable tests: There are other types of allergy testing methods that are unreliable, including applied kinesiology (allergy testing through muscle relaxation), cytotoxicity testing, urine autoinjection, skin titration (Rinkel method), and provocative and neutralization (subcutaneous) testing or sublingual provocation.[101]
 Before a diagnosis of allergic disease can be confirmed, other plausible causes of the presenting symptoms should be considered.[102] Vasomotor rhinitis, for example, is one of many illnesses that share symptoms with allergic rhinitis, underscoring the need for professional differential diagnosis.[103] Once a diagnosis of asthma, rhinitis, anaphylaxis, or other allergic disease has been made, there are several methods for discovering the causative agent of that allergy.
 Giving peanut products early may decrease the risk of allergies while only breastfeeding during at least the first few months of life may decrease the risk of dermatitis.[104][105] There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk of allergies,[104] nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful.[104] Early exposure to potential allergens may actually be protective.[5]
 Fish oil supplementation during pregnancy is associated with a lower risk.[105] Probiotic supplements during pregnancy or infancy may help to prevent atopic dermatitis.[106][107]
 Management of allergies typically involves avoiding the allergy trigger and taking medications to improve the symptoms.[6] Allergen immunotherapy may be useful for some types of allergies.[6]
 Several medications may be used to block the action of allergic mediators, or to prevent activation of cells and degranulation processes. These include antihistamines, glucocorticoids, epinephrine (adrenaline), mast cell stabilizers, and antileukotriene agents are common treatments of allergic diseases.[108] Anticholinergics, decongestants, and other compounds thought to impair eosinophil chemotaxis are also commonly used. Although rare, the severity of anaphylaxis often requires epinephrine injection, and where medical care is unavailable, a device known as an epinephrine autoinjector may be used.[27]
 Allergen immunotherapy is useful for environmental allergies, allergies to insect bites, and asthma.[6][109] Its benefit for food allergies is unclear and thus not recommended.[6] Immunotherapy involves exposing people to larger and larger amounts of allergen in an effort to change the immune system's response.[6]
 Meta-analyses have found that injections of allergens under the skin is effective in the treatment in allergic rhinitis in children[110][111] and in asthma.[109] The benefits may last for years after treatment is stopped.[112] It is generally safe and effective for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, allergic forms of asthma, and stinging insects.[113]
 To a lesser extent, the evidence also supports the use of sublingual immunotherapy for rhinitis and asthma.[112] For seasonal allergies the benefit is small.[114] In this form the allergen is given under the tongue and people often prefer it to injections.[112] Immunotherapy is not recommended as a stand-alone treatment for asthma.[112]
 An experimental treatment, enzyme potentiated desensitization (EPD), has been tried for decades but is not generally accepted as effective.[115] EPD uses dilutions of allergen and an enzyme, beta-glucuronidase, to which T-regulatory lymphocytes are supposed to respond by favoring desensitization, or down-regulation, rather than sensitization. EPD has also been tried for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, but evidence does not show effectiveness.[115]
 A review found no effectiveness of homeopathic treatments and no difference compared with placebo. The authors concluded that based on rigorous clinical trials of all types of homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments, there is no convincing evidence that supports the use of homeopathic treatments.[116]
 According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, U.S., the evidence is relatively strong that saline nasal irrigation and butterbur are effective, when compared to other alternative medicine treatments, for which the scientific evidence is weak, negative, or nonexistent, such as honey, acupuncture, omega 3's, probiotics, astragalus, capsaicin, grape seed extract, Pycnogenol, quercetin, spirulina, stinging nettle, tinospora, or guduchi.
[117][118]
 The allergic diseases—hay fever and asthma—have increased in the Western world over the past 2–3 decades.[119] Increases in allergic asthma and other atopic disorders in industrialized nations, it is estimated, began in the 1960s and 1970s, with further increases occurring during the 1980s and 1990s,[120] although some suggest that a steady rise in sensitization has been occurring since the 1920s.[121] The number of new cases per year of atopy in developing countries has, in general, remained much lower.[120]
 Although genetic factors govern susceptibility to atopic disease, increases in atopy have occurred within too short a period to be explained by a genetic change in the population, thus pointing to environmental or lifestyle changes.[120] Several hypotheses have been identified to explain this increased rate. Increased exposure to perennial allergens may be due to housing changes and increased time spent indoors, and a decreased activation of a common immune control mechanism may be caused by changes in cleanliness or hygiene, and exacerbated by dietary changes, obesity, and decline in physical exercise.[119] The hygiene hypothesis maintains[133] that high living standards and hygienic conditions exposes children to fewer infections. It is thought that reduced bacterial and viral infections early in life direct the maturing immune system away from TH1 type responses, leading to unrestrained TH2 responses that allow for an increase in allergy.[78][134]
 Changes in rates and types of infection alone, however, have been unable to explain the observed increase in allergic disease, and recent evidence has focused attention on the importance of the gastrointestinal microbial environment. Evidence has shown that exposure to food and fecal-oral pathogens, such as hepatitis A, Toxoplasma gondii, and Helicobacter pylori (which also tend to be more prevalent in developing countries), can reduce the overall risk of atopy by more than 60%,[135] and an increased rate of parasitic infections has been associated with a decreased prevalence of asthma.[136] It is speculated that these infections exert their effect by critically altering TH1/TH2 regulation.[137] Important elements of newer hygiene hypotheses also include exposure to endotoxins, exposure to pets and growing up on a farm.[137]
 Some symptoms attributable to allergic diseases are mentioned in ancient sources.[138] Particularly, three members of the Roman Julio-Claudian dynasty (Augustus, Claudius and Britannicus) are suspected to have a family history of atopy.[138][139] The concept of ""allergy"" was originally introduced in 1906 by the Viennese pediatrician Clemens von Pirquet, after he noticed that patients who had received injections of horse serum or smallpox vaccine usually had quicker, more severe reactions to second injections.[140] Pirquet called this phenomenon ""allergy"" from the Ancient Greek words ἄλλος allos meaning ""other"" and ἔργον ergon meaning ""work"".[141]
 All forms of hypersensitivity used to be classified as allergies, and all were thought to be caused by an improper activation of the immune system. Later, it became clear that several different disease mechanisms were implicated, with a common link to a disordered activation of the immune system. In 1963, a new classification scheme was designed by Philip Gell and Robin Coombs that described four types of hypersensitivity reactions, known as Type I to Type IV hypersensitivity.[142] With this new classification, the word allergy, sometimes clarified as a true allergy, was restricted to type I hypersensitivities (also called immediate hypersensitivity), which are characterized as rapidly developing reactions involving IgE antibodies.[143]
 A major breakthrough in understanding the mechanisms of allergy was the discovery of the antibody class labeled immunoglobulin E (IgE). IgE was simultaneously discovered in 1966–67 by two independent groups:[144] Ishizaka's team at the Children's Asthma Research Institute and Hospital in Denver, USA,[145] and by Gunnar Johansson and Hans Bennich in Uppsala, Sweden.[146] Their joint paper was published in April 1969.[147]
 Radiometric assays include the radioallergosorbent test (RAST test) method, which uses IgE-binding (anti-IgE) antibodies labeled with radioactive isotopes for quantifying the levels of IgE antibody in the blood.[148]
 The RAST methodology was invented and marketed in 1974 by Pharmacia Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden, and the acronym RAST is actually a brand name. In 1989, Pharmacia Diagnostics AB replaced it with a superior test named the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE blood test, which uses the newer fluorescence-labeled technology.[149]
 American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) and the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) issued the Joint Task Force Report ""Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing"" in 2008, and is firm in its statement that the term RAST is now obsolete:
 The term RAST became a colloquialism for all varieties of (in vitro allergy) tests.  This is unfortunate because it is well recognized that there are well-performing tests and some that do not perform so well, yet they are all called RASTs, making it difficult to distinguish which is which. For these reasons, it is now recommended that use of RAST as a generic descriptor of these tests be abandoned.[14] The updated version, the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE blood test, is the only specific IgE assay to receive Food and Drug Administration approval to quantitatively report to its detection limit of 0.1kU/L.[149]
 An allergist is a physician specially trained to manage and treat allergies, asthma, and the other allergic diseases.
In the United States physicians holding certification by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology (ABAI) have successfully completed an accredited educational program and evaluation process, including a proctored examination to demonstrate knowledge, skills, and experience in patient care in allergy and immunology.[150] Becoming an allergist/immunologist requires completion of at least nine years of training. After completing medical school and graduating with a medical degree, a physician will undergo three years of training in internal medicine (to become an internist) or pediatrics (to become a pediatrician). Once physicians have finished training in one of these specialties, they must pass the exam of either the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP), the American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics (AOBP), the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM), or the American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine (AOBIM). Internists or pediatricians wishing to focus on the sub-specialty of allergy-immunology then complete at least an additional two years of study, called a fellowship, in an allergy/immunology training program. Allergist/immunologists listed as ABAI-certified have successfully passed the certifying examination of the ABAI following their fellowship.[151]
 In the United Kingdom, allergy is a subspecialty of general medicine or pediatrics. After obtaining postgraduate exams (MRCP or MRCPCH), a doctor works for several years as a specialist registrar before qualifying for the General Medical Council specialist register. Allergy services may also be delivered by immunologists. A 2003 Royal College of Physicians report presented a case for improvement of what were felt to be inadequate allergy services in the UK.[152] In 2006, the House of Lords convened a subcommittee. It concluded likewise in 2007 that allergy services were insufficient to deal with what the Lords referred to as an ""allergy epidemic"" and its social cost; it made several recommendations.[153]
 Low-allergen foods are being developed, as are improvements in skin prick test predictions; evaluation of the atopy patch test, wasp sting outcomes predictions, a rapidly disintegrating epinephrine tablet, and anti-IL-5 for eosinophilic diseases.[154]

 An allergy is where your body reacts to something that's normally harmless like pollen, dust or animal fur. The symptoms can be mild, but for some people they can be very serious. Things that cause allergic reactions are called allergens. Common allergens include: Symptoms of an allergic reaction can include: You or the person who's unwell may also have a rash that's swollen, raised or itchy. These can be signs of a serious allergic reaction and may need immediate treatment in hospital. If you or someone you're with is having a serious allergic reaction and has an adrenaline auto-injector (such as an EpiPen), you should use it immediately. Instructions are included on the side of the injector if you forget how to use it or someone else needs to give you the injection. Call 999 for an ambulance after using the injector, even if you or the person you're with seems to be feeling better. A GP may arrange some allergy tests or refer you to a specialist allergy clinic to have them. Tests you may have include: Treatments for allergies include: Your specialist will give you an allergy management plan that will explain how to manage your allergy.

"An allergy is an immune system response to a foreign substance, or allergen, that’s not typically harmful to the body. Symptoms and treatments may vary depending on the type of allergy you have.  The immune system is responsible for keeping you healthy by fighting harmful pathogens.  It does this by creating antibodies called immunoglobulin. There are several types of immunoglobulins, which fight against possible agents like bacteria, viruses, parasites, and chemicals. Immunoglobin E (IgE) is a type that responds to certain substances and causes an allergic reaction.  Allergic reactions may involve a variety of symptoms, ranging from mild inflammation to life threatening situations.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1 in 3 people have an allergy in the United States.  Keep reading to learn more about the types, symptoms, and causes of allergies, as well as how to treat them. Sometimes, allergic reactions may cause symptoms that could be life threatening, known as anaphylaxis.  If you or someone you know suddenly experiences any of the following symptoms, call 911 or get immediate medical attention: If you or the person has an epinephrine autoinjector, use it immediately. The shot counters allergic reactions until medical help arrives and could be lifesaving. Learn more about what to do if someone has an allergic reaction.  There are several types of allergies, according to Allergy UK. These include: Symptoms of allergies may depend on several factors, such as the type and severity of your allergy. According to the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI), common allergy symptoms may include: Learn more about the most common allergy symptoms.  Certain skin symptoms may indicate an allergic reaction.  For instance, you may experience tingling in your mouth after eating a food you’re allergic to. Or, you may experience an allergic reaction if your skin comes into direct contact with an allergen, known as contact dermatitis. Symptoms of skin allergies may include: Learn more about allergy symptoms and what might cause them. It’s still unclear why the immune system causes an allergic reaction when a normally harmless foreign substance enters the body. However, researchers have identified several factors that may contribute to allergies, including: Several common allergens have also been identified, including foods, medications, and environmental irritants. The cause of allergies may depend on how you come into contact with it: A doctor will first ask about your symptoms and perform a physical exam.  They may ask about anything unusual you may have eaten recently and any substances you may have come in contact with. For example, if you have a rash on your hands, they may ask if you put on latex gloves recently. To confirm an allergy, they may order several tests, including: Learn more about allergy testing and diagnosis. Avoiding the allergen that triggers the reaction is the best way to prevent allergies. If that’s not possible, there are treatment options available. Allergy treatment usually includes over-the-counter or prescription medications, which are available as nasal sprays, pills, liquids, and topical ointments. Some allergy medications may include: It’s important to work with a healthcare professional to develop the best management plan for your allergies.  Immunotherapy is a treatment that involves administering small doses of an allergen to help your body become used to it over time.  There are two types of immunotherapy: Successful immunotherapy can prevent allergy symptoms from returning. If you have a severe, life threatening allergy, you’ll most likely have to carry an emergency epinephrine autoinjector. This is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis.  This shot counters allergic reactions until medical help arrives. Common brands of this treatment include: Several natural remedies and supplements could help relieve allergy symptoms. These may include: It’s important to note that limited research supports the efficacy of these natural remedies. They should be used alongside medical treatments, such as medication and immunotherapy.  Some home remedies may also trigger allergy symptoms in some people. For instance, some dried teas use flowers and plants closely related to plants that might be causing you to sneeze.  Learn more about 15 natural remedies for allergies.  There’s no way to prevent allergies from developing, but there are ways to prevent symptoms. The best way to prevent allergy symptoms is to avoid the allergens that trigger them.  Other tips to prevent allergies include: Learn more about how to prevent allergic reactions.  The most severe complication of allergies is anaphylaxis.  If not treated immediately, anaphylaxis may lead to death in less than 5 minutes.  Allergies and allergy treatments may lead to complications that affect your heart, circulation, and breathing. For instance, people with heart disease are at a greater risk of heart attack.  If you have allergies, speak with a healthcare professional about potential complications. They could help develop the best management plan for you.  Allergies may be associated with other conditions or cause similar symptoms.  Asthma is a common respiratory condition that can make breathing more difficult and narrow the air passageways in the lungs.  Allergies are the most common asthma trigger, according to the Allergy and Asthma Foundation of America.  Allergic asthma is when these conditions occur together.  Allergies and the common cold may have similar symptoms, such as runny nose, headache, and coughing.  However, some additional signs and symptoms may help you distinguish between them. For instance, allergies may cause skin rashes and itchy eyes, while the common cold can lead to body aches and even fever.  The common cold may last up to 2 weeks, while allergies like hay fever could last a few months. Learn more about the differences between allergies and the common cold.  Hay fever may produce symptoms that include sneezing, itchy eyes, and coughing. Chronic cough is a cough that lasts more than 8 weeks. Hay fever cough is usually temporary because it’s typically a seasonal allergy. However, sometimes hay fever may cause a dry cough that lasts longer than 3 weeks. Bronchitis is inflammation of the lungs, typically caused by a viral infection, such as influenza or the common cold.  Acute bronchitis may last up to 3 weeks, but chronic bronchitis can linger for months and return frequently. Bronchitis may result from common allergens, such as pollen, cigarette smoke, and perfume, among others.  Your child may have an allergy if they experience frequent symptoms like coughing, sneezing, skin rashes, and nausea, according to the ACAAI. According to the CDC, 1 in 4 children in the United States experienced an allergy in 2021.  The three most common allergies in children are: Common allergy symptoms include itchy eyes, sneezing, facial tenderness, headache, fatigue, difficulty breathing, wheezing, dizziness, lightheadedness, and nausea, among others. The 9 most common food allergies include cow’s milk, sesame, eggs, fish, wheat, shellfish, soy, peanuts, and tree nuts.  Treatment for allergies may include medications like antihistamines, decongestants, and epinephrine autoinjectors, as well as immunotherapy and home remedies. Allergies are common and don’t have life threatening consequences for most people.  However, if you’re at risk of anaphylaxis, it’s important to carry an epinephrine autoinjector and use it immediately if you experience allergy symptoms. This could be lifesaving.  Most allergies are manageable with avoidance, medications, and lifestyle changes. Working with a doctor can help reduce major complications and make life more enjoyable.

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and progressively worsens,[2] and is the cause of 60–70% of cases of dementia.[2][15] The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events.[1] As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, self-neglect, and behavioral issues.[2] As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society.[16] Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to twelve years.[11][12][13]
 The cause of Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood.[16] There are many environmental and genetic risk factors associated with its development. The strongest genetic risk factor is from an allele of apolipoprotein E.[17][18] Other risk factors include a history of head injury, clinical depression, and high blood pressure.[1] The progress of the protein misfolding disease is largely associated with amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and loss of neuronal connections in the brain.[19] A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing, with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes.[8][20] Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal brain aging.[16] Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis, but this can only take place after death.[21][22]
 No treatments can stop or reverse its progression, though some may temporarily improve symptoms.[2] A healthy diet, physical activity, and social engagement are generally beneficial in ageing, and may help in reducing the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's.[19] Affected people become increasingly reliant on others for assistance, often placing a burden on caregivers.[23] The pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements.[23] Exercise programs may be beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and can potentially improve outcomes.[24] Behavioral problems or psychosis due to dementia are sometimes treated with antipsychotics, but this has an increased risk of early death.[25][26]
 As of 2020, there were approximately 50 million people worldwide with Alzheimer's disease.[14] It most often begins in people over 65 years of age, although up to 10% of cases are early-onset impacting those in their 30s to mid-60s.[27][4] It affects about 6% of people 65 years and older,[16] and women more often than men.[28] The disease is named after German psychiatrist and pathologist Alois Alzheimer, who first described it in 1906.[29] Alzheimer's financial burden on society is large, with an estimated global annual cost of US$1 trillion.[14] It is ranked as the seventh leading cause of death worldwide.[30]
 The course of Alzheimer's is generally described in three stages, with a progressive pattern of cognitive and functional impairment.[31][27] The three stages are described as early or mild, middle or moderate, and late or severe.[31] The disease is known to target the hippocampus which is associated with memory, and this is responsible for the first symptoms of memory impairment. As the disease progresses so does the degree of memory impairment.[19]
 The first symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress.[32] Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up to eight years before a person fulfills the clinical criteria for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.[33] These early symptoms can affect the most complex activities of daily living.[34] The most noticeable deficit is short term memory loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information.[33]
 Subtle problems with the executive functions of attentiveness, planning, flexibility, and abstract thinking, or impairments in semantic memory (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.[33] Apathy and depression can be seen at this stage, with apathy remaining as the most persistent symptom throughout the course of the disease.[35][36] Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often found to be a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia. MCI can present with a variety of symptoms, and when memory loss is the predominant symptom, it is termed amnestic MCI and is frequently seen as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease.[37] Amnesic MCI has a greater than 90% likelihood of being associated with Alzheimer's.[38]
 In people with Alzheimer's disease, the increasing impairment of learning and memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems.[39] Alzheimer's disease does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body on how to do things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.[40][41]
 Language problems are mainly characterised by a shrinking vocabulary and decreased word fluency, leading to a general impoverishment of oral and written language.[39][42] In this stage, the person with Alzheimer's is usually capable of communicating basic ideas adequately.[39][42][43] While performing fine motor tasks such as writing, drawing, or dressing, certain movement coordination and planning difficulties (apraxia) may be present, but they are commonly unnoticed.[39] As the disease progresses, people with Alzheimer's disease can often continue to perform many tasks independently, but may need assistance or supervision with the most cognitively demanding activities.[39]
 Progressive deterioration eventually hinders independence, with subjects being unable to perform most common activities of daily living.[39] Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions (paraphasias). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost.[39][43] Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and Alzheimer's disease progresses, so the risk of falling increases.[39] During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives.[39] Long-term memory, which was previously intact, becomes impaired.[39]
 Behavioral and neuropsychiatric changes become more prevalent. Common manifestations are wandering, irritability and emotional lability, leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated aggression, or resistance to caregiving.[39] Sundowning can also appear.[44] Approximately 30% of people with Alzheimer's disease develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms.[39] Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations (anosognosia).[39] Urinary incontinence can develop.[39] These symptoms create stress for relatives and caregivers, which can be reduced by moving the person from home care to other long-term care facilities.[39][45]
 During the final stage, known as the late-stage or severe stage, there is complete dependence on caregivers.[19][31][39] Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words, eventually leading to complete loss of speech.[39][43] Despite the loss of verbal language abilities, people can often understand and return emotional signals. Although aggressiveness can still be present, extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common symptoms. People with Alzheimer's disease will ultimately not be able to perform even the simplest tasks independently; muscle mass and mobility deteriorates to the point where they are bedridden and unable to feed themselves. The cause of death is usually an external factor, such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia, not the disease itself.[39] In some cases, there is a paradoxical lucidity immediately before death, where there is an unexpected recovery of mental clarity.[46]
 Alzheimer's disease is believed to occur when abnormal amounts of amyloid beta (Aβ), accumulating extracellularly as amyloid plaques and tau proteins, or intracellularly as neurofibrillary tangles, form in the brain, affecting neuronal functioning and connectivity, resulting in a progressive loss of brain function.[47][48] This altered protein clearance ability is age-related, regulated by brain cholesterol,[49] and associated with other neurodegenerative diseases.[50][51]
 The cause for most Alzheimer's cases is still mostly unknown,[14] except for 1–2% of cases where deterministic genetic differences have been identified.[17] Several competing hypotheses attempt to explain the underlying cause; the most predominant hypothesis is the amyloid beta (Aβ) hypothesis.[14]
 The oldest hypothesis, on which most drug therapies are based, is the cholinergic hypothesis, which proposes that Alzheimer's disease is caused by reduced synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.[14] The loss of cholinergic neurons noted in the limbic system and cerebral cortex, is a key feature in the progression of Alzheimer's.[37] The 1991 amyloid hypothesis postulated that extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits are the fundamental cause of the disease.[52][53] Support for this postulate comes from the location of the gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit at least the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's disease by 40 years of age.[10] A specific isoform of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.[15] While apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task (such as APOE4), leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brain.[54]
 Late-onset Alzheimer's is about 70% heritable.[55][56] Genetic models in 2020 predict Alzheimer's disease with 90% accuracy.[57] Most cases of Alzheimer's are not familial, and so they are termed sporadic Alzheimer's disease.[medical citation needed] Most cases of sporadic Alzheimer's disease are late onset, developing after the age of 65 years.[58]
 The strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease is APOEε4.[18] APOEε4 is one of four alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE). APOE plays a major role in lipid-binding proteins in lipoprotein particles and the ε4 allele disrupts this function.[59] Between 40 and 80% of people with Alzheimer's disease possess at least one APOEε4 allele.[60] The APOEε4 allele increases the risk of the disease by three times in heterozygotes and by 15 times in homozygotes.[61] Like many human diseases, environmental effects and genetic modifiers result in incomplete penetrance. For example, Nigerian Yoruba people do not show the relationship between dose of APOEε4 and incidence or age-of-onset for Alzheimer's disease seen in other human populations.[62][63]
 Only 1–2% of Alzheimer's cases are inherited due to autosomal dominant effects, as Alzheimer's is highly polygenic. When the disease is caused by autosomal dominant variants, it is known as early onset familial Alzheimer's disease, which is rarer and has a faster rate of progression.[17] Less than 5% of sporadic Alzheimer's disease have an earlier onset,[17] and early-onset Alzheimer's is about 90% heritable.[55][56] FAD usually implies multiple persons affected in one or more generations.[medical citation needed][64]
 Early onset familial Alzheimer's disease can be attributed to mutations in one of three genes: those encoding amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and presenilins PSEN1 and PSEN2.[38] Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called amyloid beta (Aβ)42, which is the main component of amyloid plaques.[65] Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms—particularly Aβ40—without increasing Aβ42 levels in the brain.[66] Two other genes associated with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease are ABCA7 and SORL1.[67]
 Alleles in the TREM2 gene have been associated with a three to five times higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.[68]
 A Japanese pedigree of familial Alzheimer's disease was found to be associated with a deletion mutation of codon 693 of APP.[69] This mutation and its association with Alzheimer's disease was first reported in 2008,[70] and is known as the Osaka mutation. Only homozygotes with this mutation have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. This mutation accelerates Aβ oligomerization but the proteins do not form the amyloid fibrils that aggregate into amyloid plaques, suggesting that it is the Aβ oligomerization rather than the fibrils that may be the cause of this disease. Mice expressing this mutation have all the usual pathologies of Alzheimer's disease.[71]
 The tau hypothesis proposes that tau protein abnormalities initiate the disease cascade.[53] In this model, hyperphosphorylated tau begins to pair with other threads of tau as paired helical filaments. Eventually, they form neurofibrillary tangles inside nerve cell bodies.[72] When this occurs, the microtubules disintegrate, destroying the structure of the cell's cytoskeleton which collapses the neuron's transport system.[73]
 A number of studies connect the misfolded amyloid beta and tau proteins associated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, as bringing about oxidative stress that leads to neuroinflammation.[74] This chronic inflammation is also a feature of other neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease, and ALS.[75] Spirochete infections have also been linked to dementia.[14] DNA damages accumulate in AD brains; reactive oxygen species may be the major source of this DNA damage.[76]
 Sleep disturbances are seen as a possible risk factor for inflammation in Alzheimer's disease.[77] Sleep disruption was previously only seen as a consequence of Alzheimer's disease, but as of 2020[update], accumulating evidence suggests that this relationship may be bidirectional.[78]
 The cellular homeostasis of biometals such as ionic copper, iron, and zinc is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease, though it remains unclear whether this is produced by or causes the changes in proteins.[14][79] Smoking is a significant Alzheimer's disease risk factor.[1] Systemic markers of the innate immune system are risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.[80] Exposure to air pollution may be a contributing factor to the development of Alzheimer's disease.[14]
 
 Retrogenesis is a medical hypothesis that just as the fetus goes through a process of neurodevelopment beginning with neurulation and ending with myelination, the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease go through a reverse neurodegeneration process starting with demyelination and death of axons (white matter) and ending with the death of grey matter.[81] Likewise the hypothesis is, that as infants go through states of cognitive development, people with Alzheimer's disease go through the reverse process of progressive cognitive impairment.[82]
 The association with celiac disease is unclear, with a 2019 study finding no increase in dementia overall in those with CD, while a 2018 review found an association with several types of dementia including Alzheimer's disease.[83][84]
 According to one theory, dysfunction of oligodendrocytes and their associated myelin during aging contributes to axon damage, which in turn generates in amyloid production and tau hyper-phosphorylation.[85][86]
 Studies have shown a potential link between infection with certain viruses and developing Alzheimer's disease later in life.[87] Notably, a large scale study conducted on 6,245,282 patients has shown an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease following COVID-19 infection in cognitively normal individuals over 65.[88]
 Alzheimer's disease is characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy of the affected regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus.[89] Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei particularly the locus coeruleus in the pons.[90] Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with Alzheimer's disease as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.[91][92]
 Both Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are clearly visible by microscopy in brains of those with Alzheimer's disease,[93] especially in the hippocampus.[94] However, Alzheimer's disease may occur without neurofibrillary tangles in the neocortex.[95] Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau which has become hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles as a consequence of aging, the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe.[96] Lewy bodies are not rare in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.[97]
 Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a protein misfolding disease, a proteopathy, caused by the accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein into amyloid plaques, and tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.[98] Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43 amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (Aβ). Amyloid beta is a fragment from the larger amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) a transmembrane protein that penetrates the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair.[99][100] In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments.[101] One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as amyloid plaques.[93][102]
 Alzheimer's disease is also considered a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly made up of structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In Alzheimer's disease, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.[103] Pathogenic tau can also cause neuronal death through transposable element dysregulation.[104] Necroptosis has also been reported as a mechanism of cell death in brain cells affected with tau tangles.[105][106]
 Exactly how disturbances of production and aggregation of the beta-amyloid peptide give rise to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease is not known.[107][108] The amyloid hypothesis traditionally points to the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides as the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated amyloid fibrils, which are believed to be the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis, induces programmed cell death (apoptosis).[109] It is also known that Aβ selectively builds up in the mitochondria in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected brains, and it also inhibits certain enzyme functions and the utilisation of glucose by neurons.[110]
 Iron dyshomeostasis is linked to disease progression, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death called ferroptosis could be involved. Products of lipid peroxidation are also elevated in AD brain compared with controls.[111]
 Various inflammatory processes and cytokines may also have a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation is a general marker of tissue damage in any disease, and may be either secondary to tissue damage in Alzheimer's disease or a marker of an immunological response.[112] There is increasing evidence of a strong interaction between the neurons and the immunological mechanisms in the brain. Obesity and systemic inflammation may interfere with immunological processes which promote disease progression.[113]
 Alterations in the distribution of different neurotrophic factors and in the expression of their receptors such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been described in Alzheimer's disease.[114][115]
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) can only be definitively diagnosed with autopsy findings; in the absence of autopsy, clinical diagnoses of AD are ""possible"" or ""probable"", based on other findings.[21][22][116] Up to 23% of those clinically diagnosed with AD may be misdiagnosed and may have pathology suggestive of another condition with symptoms that mimic those of AD.[22]
 AD is usually clinically diagnosed based on the person's medical history, history from relatives, and behavioral observations. The presence of characteristic neurological and neuropsychological features and the absence of alternative conditions supports the diagnosis.[needs update][117][118] Advanced medical imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET), can be used to help exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia.[119] Moreover, it may predict conversion from prodromal stages (mild cognitive impairment) to Alzheimer's disease.[120] FDA-approved radiopharmaceutical diagnostic agents used in PET for Alzheimer's disease are florbetapir (2012), flutemetamol (2013), florbetaben (2014), and flortaucipir (2020).[121] Because many insurance companies in the United States do not cover this procedure, its use in clinical practice is largely limited to clinical trials as of 2018[update].[122]
 Assessment of intellectual functioning including memory testing can further characterise the state of the disease.[1] Medical organizations have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardise the diagnostic process for practising physicians. Definitive diagnosis can only be confirmed with post-mortem evaluations when brain material is available and can be examined histologically for senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.[122][123]
 There are three sets of criteria for the clinical diagnoses of the spectrum of Alzheimer's disease: the 2013 fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5); the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) definition as revised in 2011; and the International Working Group criteria as revised in 2010.[38][122] Three broad time periods, which can span decades, define the progression of Alzheimer's disease from the preclinical phase, to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), followed by Alzheimer's disease dementia.[124]
 Eight intellectual domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, motor skills, orientation, problem solving and executive functional abilities, as listed in the fourth text revision of the DSM (DSM-IV-TR).[125]
 The DSM-5 defines criteria for probable or possible Alzheimer's for both major and mild neurocognitive disorder.[126][127][116] Major or mild neurocognitive disorder must be present along with at least one cognitive deficit for a diagnosis of either probable or possible AD.[126][128] For major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease, probable Alzheimer's disease can be diagnosed if the individual has genetic evidence of Alzheimer's[129] or if two or more acquired cognitive deficits, and a functional disability that is not from another disorder, are present.[130] Otherwise, possible Alzheimer's disease can be diagnosed as the diagnosis follows an atypical route.[131] For mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's, probable Alzheimer's disease can be diagnosed if there is genetic evidence, whereas possible Alzheimer's disease can be met if all of the following are present: no genetic evidence, decline in both learning and memory, two or more cognitive deficits, and a functional disability not from another disorder.[126][132]
 The NIA-AA criteria are used mainly in research rather than in clinical assessments.[133] They define Alzheimer's disease through three major stages: preclinical, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's dementia.[134][135] Diagnosis in the preclinical stage is complex and focuses on asymptomatic individuals;[135][136] the latter two stages describe individuals experiencing symptoms.[135] The core clinical criteria for MCI is used along with identification of biomarkers,[137] predominantly those for neuronal injury (mainly tau-related) and amyloid beta deposition.[133][135] The core clinical criteria itself rests on the presence of cognitive impairment[135] without the presence of comorbidities.[138][139] The third stage is divided into probable and possible Alzheimer's disease dementia.[139] In probable Alzheimer's disease dementia there is steady impairment of cognition over time and a memory-related or non-memory-related cognitive dysfunction.[139] In possible Alzheimer's disease dementia, another causal disease such as cerebrovascular disease is present.[139]
 Neuropsychological tests including cognitive tests such as the mini–mental state examination (MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini-Cog are widely used to aid in diagnosis of the cognitive impairments in AD.[140] These tests may not always be accurate, as they lack sensitivity to mild cognitive impairment, and can be biased by language or attention problems;[140] more comprehensive test arrays are necessary for high reliability of results, particularly in the earliest stages of the disease.[141][142]
 Further neurological examinations are crucial in the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other diseases.[32] Interviews with family members are used in assessment; caregivers can supply important information on daily living abilities and on the decrease in the person's mental function.[143] A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with Alzheimer's disease is commonly unaware of their deficits.[144] Many times, families have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.[145]
 Supplemental testing can rule out other potentially treatable diagnoses and help avoid misdiagnoses.[146] Common supplemental tests include blood tests, thyroid function tests, as well as tests to assess vitamin B12 levels, rule out neurosyphilis and rule out metabolic problems (including tests for kidney function, electrolyte levels and for diabetes).[146] MRI or CT scans might also be used to rule out other potential causes of the symptoms – including tumors or strokes.[140] Delirium and depression can be common among individuals and are important to rule out.[147]
 Psychological tests for depression are used, since depression can either be concurrent with Alzheimer's disease (see Depression of Alzheimer disease), an early sign of cognitive impairment,[148] or even the cause.[149][150]
 Due to low accuracy, the C-PIB-PET scan is not recommended as an early diagnostic tool or for predicting the development of Alzheimer's disease when people show signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI).[151] The use of 18F-FDG PET scans, as a single test, to identify people who may develop Alzheimer's disease is not supported by evidence.[152]
 There are no disease-modifying treatments available to cure Alzheimer's disease and because of this, AD research has focused on interventions to prevent the onset and progression.[153] There is no evidence that supports any particular measure in preventing Alzheimer's,[1] and studies of measures to prevent the onset or progression have produced inconsistent results. Epidemiological studies have proposed relationships between an individual's likelihood of developing AD and modifiable factors, such as medications, lifestyle, and diet. There are some challenges in determining whether interventions for Alzheimer's disease act as a primary prevention method, preventing the disease itself, or a secondary prevention method, identifying the early stages of the disease.[154] These challenges include duration of intervention, different stages of disease at which intervention begins, and lack of standardization of inclusion criteria regarding biomarkers specific for Alzheimer's disease.[154] Further research is needed to determine factors that can help prevent Alzheimer's disease.[154]
 Cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking, are associated with a higher risk of onset and worsened course of AD.[155][156] The use of statins to lower cholesterol may be of benefit in Alzheimer's.[157] Antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications in individuals without overt cognitive impairment may decrease the risk of dementia by influencing cerebrovascular pathology.[1][158] More research is needed to examine the relationship with Alzheimer's disease specifically; clarification of the direct role medications play versus other concurrent lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, smoking) is needed.[1]
 Depression is associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease; management with antidepressants may provide a preventative measure.[5]
 Historically, long-term usage of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were thought to be associated with a reduced likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease as it reduces inflammation; however, NSAIDs do not appear to be useful as a treatment.[122] Additionally, because women have a higher incidence of Alzheimer's disease than men, it was once thought that estrogen deficiency during menopause was a risk factor. However, there is a lack of evidence to show that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in menopause decreases risk of cognitive decline.[159]
 Certain lifestyle activities, such as physical and cognitive exercises, higher education and occupational attainment, cigarette smoking, stress, sleep, and the management of other comorbidities, including diabetes and hypertension, may affect the risk of developing Alzheimer's.[5]
 Physical exercise is associated with a decreased rate of dementia,[6] and is effective in reducing symptom severity in those with AD.[160] Memory and cognitive functions can be improved with aerobic exercises including brisk walking three times weekly for forty minutes.[161] It may also induce neuroplasticity of the brain.[162] Participating in mental exercises, such as reading, crossword puzzles, and chess have shown a potential to be preventative.[5] Meeting the WHO recommendations for physical activity is associated with a lower risk of AD.[163]
 Higher education and occupational attainment, and participation in leisure activities, contribute to a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's,[7] or of delaying the onset of symptoms. This is compatible with the cognitive reserve theory, which states that some life experiences result in more efficient neural functioning providing the individual a cognitive reserve that delays the onset of dementia manifestations.[7] Education delays the onset of Alzheimer's disease syndrome without changing the duration of the disease.[164]
 Cessation in smoking may reduce risk of developing Alzheimer's' disease, specifically in those who carry APOE ɛ4 allele.[165][5] The increased oxidative stress caused by smoking results in downstream inflammatory or neurodegenerative processes that may increase risk of developing AD.[166] Avoidance of smoking, counseling and pharmacotherapies to quit smoking are used, and avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke is recommended.[5]
 Alzheimer's disease is associated with sleep disorders but the precise relationship is unclear.[167][168] It was once thought that as people get older, the risk of developing sleep disorders and AD independently increase, but research is examining whether sleep disorders may increase the prevalence of AD.[167] One theory is that the mechanisms to increase clearance of toxic substances, including Aβ, are active during sleep.[167][169] With decreased sleep, a person is increasing Aβ production and decreasing Aβ clearance, resulting in Aβ accumulation.[170][167][168] Receiving adequate sleep (approximately 7–8 hours) every night has become a potential lifestyle intervention to prevent the development of AD.[5]
 Stress is a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's.[5] The mechanism by which stress predisposes someone to development of Alzheimer's is unclear, but it is suggested that lifetime stressors may affect a person's epigenome, leading to an overexpression or under expression of specific genes.[171] Although the relationship of stress and Alzheimer's is unclear, strategies to reduce stress and relax the mind may be helpful strategies in preventing the progression or Alzheimer's disease.[172] Meditation, for instance, is a helpful lifestyle change to support cognition and well-being, though further research is needed to assess long-term effects.[162]
 There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease;[173] available treatments offer relatively small symptomatic benefits but remain palliative in nature.[14][174] Treatments can be divided into pharmaceutical, psychosocial, and caregiving.
 Medications used to treat the cognitive symptons of Alzheimer's disease rather than the underlying cause include: four acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, rivastigmine, galantamine, and donepezil) and memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are intended for those with mild to severe Alzheimer's, whereas memantine is intended for those with moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease.[122] The benefit from their use is small.[175][176][177][15]
 Reduction in the activity of the cholinergic neurons is a well-known feature of Alzheimer's disease.[178] Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce the rate at which acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons.[179] There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease,[180][175] and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage.[175] The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of Alzheimer's disease.[181] The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are mild to moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses.[182] Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.[180]
 Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter of the nervous system, although excessive amounts in the brain can lead to cell death through a process called excitotoxicity which consists of the overstimulation of glutamate receptors. Excitotoxicity occurs not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also in other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.[183] Memantine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist first used as an anti-influenza agent. It acts on the glutamatergic system by blocking NMDA receptors and inhibiting their overstimulation by glutamate.[183][184] Memantine has been shown to have a small benefit in the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease.[185] Reported adverse events with memantine are infrequent and mild, including hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, headache and fatigue.[186][187] The combination of memantine and donepezil[188] has been shown to be ""of statistically significant but clinically marginal effectiveness"".[189]
 An extract of Ginkgo biloba known as EGb 761 has been used for treating Alzheimer's and other neuropsychiatric disorders.[190] Its use is approved throughout Europe.[191] The World Federation of Biological Psychiatry guidelines lists EGb 761 with the same weight of evidence (level B) given to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. EGb 761 is the only one that showed improvement of symptoms in both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. EGb 761 may have a role either on its own or as an add-on if other therapies prove ineffective.[190] A 2016 review concluded that the quality of evidence from clinical trials on Ginkgo biloba has been insufficient to warrant its use for treating Alzheimer's disease.[192]
 Atypical antipsychotics are modestly useful in reducing aggression and psychosis in people with Alzheimer's disease, but their advantages are offset by serious adverse effects, such as stroke, movement difficulties or cognitive decline.[193] When used in the long-term, they have been shown to associate with increased mortality.[194] Stopping antipsychotic use in this group of people appears to be safe.[195]
 Psychosocial interventions are used as an adjunct to pharmaceutical treatment and can be classified within behavior-, emotion-, cognition- or stimulation-oriented approaches.[needs update][196]
 Behavioral interventions attempt to identify and reduce the antecedents and consequences of problem behaviors. This approach has not shown success in improving overall functioning,[197] but can help to reduce some specific problem behaviors, such as incontinence.[198] There is a lack of high quality data on the effectiveness of these techniques in other behavior problems such as wandering.[199][200] Music therapy is effective in reducing behavioral and psychological symptoms.[201]
 Emotion-oriented interventions include reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, supportive psychotherapy, sensory integration, also called snoezelen, and simulated presence therapy. A Cochrane review has found no evidence that this is effective.[202] Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. A 2018 review of the effectiveness of RT found that effects were inconsistent, small in size and of doubtful clinical significance, and varied by setting.[203] Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is based on attachment theories and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce challenging behaviors.[204]
 The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, which include reality orientation and cognitive retraining, is the reduction of cognitive deficits. Reality orientation consists of the presentation of information about time, place, or person to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand, cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercising mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities.[205]
 Stimulation-oriented treatments include art, music and pet therapies, exercise, and any other kind of recreational activities. Stimulation has modest support for improving behavior, mood, and, to a lesser extent, function. Nevertheless, as important as these effects are, the main support for the use of stimulation therapies is the change in the person's routine.[196]
 Since Alzheimer's has no cure and it gradually renders people incapable of tending to their own needs, caregiving is essentially the treatment and must be carefully managed over the course of the disease.
 During the early and moderate stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase safety and reduce caretaker burden.[206][207] Examples of such modifications are the adherence to simplified routines, the placing of safety locks, the labeling of household items to cue the person with the disease or the use of modified daily life objects.[196][208][209] If eating becomes problematic, food will need to be prepared in smaller pieces or even puréed.[210] When swallowing difficulties arise, the use of feeding tubes may be required. In such cases, the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of the caregivers and family members.[211][212] The use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease, although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with Alzheimer's disease or their caregivers.[196]
 During the final stages of the disease, treatment is centred on relieving discomfort until death, often with the help of hospice.[213]
 Diet may be a modifiable risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease. The Mediterranean diet, and the DASH diet are both associated with less cognitive decline. A different approach has been to incorporate elements of both of these diets into one known as the MIND diet.[214] Studies of individual dietary components, minerals and supplements are conflicting as to whether they prevent AD or cognitive decline.[214]
 The early stages of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.[39]
 Life expectancy of people with Alzheimer's disease is reduced.[215] The normal life expectancy for 60 to 70 years old is 23 to 15 years; for 90 years old it is 4.5 years.[216] Following Alzheimer's disease diagnosis it ranges from 7 to 10 years for those in their 60s and early 70s (a loss of 13 to 8 years), to only about 3 years or less (a loss of 1.5 years) for those in their 90s.[215]
 Fewer than 3% of people live more than fourteen years after diagnosis.[217] Disease features significantly associated with reduced survival are an increased severity of cognitive impairment, decreased functional level, disturbances in the neurological examination, history of falls, malnutrition, dehydration and weight loss.[3] Other coincident diseases such as heart problems, diabetes, or history of alcohol abuse are also related with shortened survival.[218][219][220] While the earlier the age at onset the higher the total survival years, life expectancy is particularly reduced when compared to the healthy population among those who are younger.[221] Men have a less favourable survival prognosis than women.[needs update][217][222]
 Aspiration pneumonia is the most frequent immediate cause of death brought by Alzheimer's disease.[3] While the reasons behind the lower prevalence of cancer in Alzheimer's patients remain unclear, some researchers hypothesize that biological mechanisms shared by both diseases might play a role. However, this requires further investigation.[223]
 Two main measures are used in epidemiological studies: incidence and prevalence. Incidence is the number of new cases per unit of person-time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person-years); while prevalence is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at any given time.
 Regarding incidence, cohort longitudinal studies (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person-years for all dementias and 5–8 for Alzheimer's disease,[224][225] which means that half of new dementia cases each year are Alzheimer's disease. Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every 5 years after the age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years.[224][225] Females with Alzheimer's disease are more common than males, but this difference is likely due to women's longer life spans. When adjusted for age, both sexes are affected by Alzheimer's at equal rates.[15] In the United States, the risk of dying from Alzheimer's disease in 2010 was 26% higher among the non-Hispanic white population than among the non-Hispanic black population, and the Hispanic population had a 30% lower risk than the non-Hispanic white population.[226] However, much Alzheimer's research remains to be done in minority groups, such as the African American, East Asian and Hispanic/Latino populations.[227][228] Studies have shown that these groups are underrepresented in clinical trials and do not have the same risk of developing Alzheimer's when carrying certain genetic risk factors (i.e. APOE4), compared to their caucasian counterparts.[228][229][230]
 The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in populations is dependent upon factors including incidence and survival. Since the incidence of Alzheimer's disease increases with age, prevalence depends on the mean age of the population for which prevalence is given. In the United States in 2020, Alzheimer's dementia prevalence was estimated to be 5.3% for those in the 60–74 age group, with the rate increasing to 13.8% in the 74–84 group and to 34.6% in those greater than 85.[231] Prevalence rates in some less developed regions around the globe are lower.[232][233] As the incidence and prevalence are steadily increasing, the prevalence itself is projected to triple by 2050.[clarification needed][234] As of 2020, 50 million people globally have AD, with this number expected to increase to 152 million by 2050.[14]
 The ancient Greek and Roman philosophers and physicians associated old age with increasing dementia.[29] It was not until 1901 that German psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer identified the first case of what became known as Alzheimer's disease, named after him, in a fifty-year-old woman he called Auguste D. He followed her case until she died in 1906 when he first reported publicly on it.[235] During the next five years, eleven similar cases were reported in the medical literature, some of them already using the term Alzheimer's disease.[29] The disease was first described as a distinctive disease by Emil Kraepelin after suppressing some of the clinical (delusions and hallucinations) and pathological features (arteriosclerotic changes) contained in the original report of Auguste D.[236] He included Alzheimer's disease, also named presenile dementia by Kraepelin, as a subtype of senile dementia in the eighth edition of his Textbook of Psychiatry, published on 15 July, 1910.[237]
 For most of the 20th century, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals between the ages of 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on Alzheimer's disease concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not rule out the possibility that they had different causes.[238] This eventually led to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease independent of age.[239] The term senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used to describe those who were younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and neuropathology.[240]
 The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, now known as the Alzheimer's Association) established the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984,[241] extensively updated in 2007.[242][146] These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable Alzheimer's disease. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation.[243]
 Dementia, and specifically Alzheimer's disease, may be among the most costly diseases for societies worldwide.[244] As populations age, these costs will probably increase and become an important social problem and economic burden.[245] Costs associated with AD include direct and indirect medical costs, which vary between countries depending on social care for a person with AD.[244][246][247] Direct costs include doctor visits, hospital care, medical treatments, nursing home care, specialized equipment, and household expenses.[244][245] Indirect costs include the cost of informal care and the loss in productivity of informal caregivers.[245]
 In the United States as of 2019[update], informal (family) care is estimated to constitute nearly three-fourths of caregiving for people with AD at a cost of US$234 billion per year and approximately 18.5 billion hours of care.[244] The cost to society worldwide to care for individuals with AD is projected to increase nearly ten-fold, and reach about US$9.1 trillion by 2050.[246]
 Costs for those with more severe dementia or behavioral disturbances are higher and are related to the additional caregiving time to provide physical care.[247]
 Individuals with Alzheimer's will require assistance in their lifetime, and care will most likely come in the form of a full-time caregiver which is often a role that is taken on by the spouse or a close relative. Caregiving tends to include physical and emotional burdens as well as time and financial strain at times on the person administering the aid.[248][249] Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers which includes social, psychological, physical, or economic aspects.[23][250][251] Home care is usually preferred by both those people with Alzheimer's disease as well as their families.[252] This option also delays or eliminates the need for more professional and costly levels of care.[252][253] Nevertheless, two-thirds of nursing home residents have dementias.[196]
 Dementia caregivers are subject to high rates of physical and mental disorders.[254] Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviors of the cared person such as depression, behavioral disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation.[255][256] Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with Alzheimer's disease, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and indirect costs of caring for somebody with Alzheimer's average between $18,000 and $77,500 per year in the United States, depending on the study.[257][249]
 Cognitive behavioral therapy and the teaching of coping strategies either individually or in group have demonstrated their efficacy in improving caregivers' psychological health.[23][258]
 Alzheimer's disease has been portrayed in films such as: Iris (2001), based on John Bayley's memoir of his wife Iris Murdoch;[259] The Notebook (2004), based on Nicholas Sparks's 1996 novel of the same name;[260] A Moment to Remember (2004); Thanmathra (2005);[261] Memories of Tomorrow (Ashita no Kioku) (2006), based on Hiroshi Ogiwara's novel of the same name;[262] Away from Her (2006), based on Alice Munro's short story The Bear Came over the Mountain;[263] Still Alice (2014), about a Columbia University professor who has early onset Alzheimer's disease, based on Lisa Genova's 2007 novel of the same name and featuring Julianne Moore in the title role. Documentaries on Alzheimer's disease include Malcolm and Barbara: A Love Story (1999) and Malcolm and Barbara: Love's Farewell (2007), both featuring Malcolm Pointon.[264][265][266]
 Alzheimer's disease has also been portrayed in music by English musician the Caretaker in releases such as Persistent Repetition of Phrases (2008), An Empty Bliss Beyond This World (2011), and Everywhere at the End of Time (2016–2019).[267][268][269] Paintings depicting the disorder include the late works by American artist William Utermohlen, who drew self-portraits from 1995 to 2000 as an experiment of showing his disease through art.[270][271]
 Antibodies may have the ability to alter the disease course by targeting amyloid beta with immunotherapy medications such as donanemab, aducanumab, and lecanemab.[272][273][274] Aducanumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021, using the accelerated approval process, although the approval generated controversy and more evidence is needed to address administration, safety, and effectiveness.[275][276][277][278] It has less effectiveness in people who already had severe Alzheimer's symptoms.[279] Lecanemab was approved via the FDA accelerated approval process,[280][281][282] and was converted to traditional approval in July 2023, after further testing, along with the addition of a boxed warning about amyloid-related imaging abnormalities.[283][284] Donanemab was approved by the FDA in July 2024.[285] Anti-amyloid drugs also cause brain shrinkage.[286]
 Specific medications that may reduce the risk or progression of Alzheimer's disease have been studied.[287] The research trials investigating medications generally impact Aβ plaques, inflammation, APOE, neurotransmitter receptors, neurogenesis, growth factors or hormones.[287][288][289]
 Machine learning algorithms with electronic health records are being studied as a way to predict Alzheimer's disease earlier.[290]

"Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that gets worse over time. It's characterized by changes in the brain that lead to deposits of certain proteins. Alzheimer's disease causes the brain to shrink and brain cells to eventually die. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia — a gradual decline in memory, thinking, behavior and social skills. These changes affect a person's ability to function. About 6.5 million people in the United States age 65 and older live with Alzheimer's disease. Among them, more than 70% are 75 years old and older. Of the about 55 million people worldwide with dementia, 60% to 70% are estimated to have Alzheimer's disease. The early signs of the disease include forgetting recent events or conversations. Over time, it progresses to serious memory problems and loss of the ability to perform everyday tasks. Medicines may improve or slow the progression of symptoms. Programs and services can help support people with the disease and their caregivers. There is no treatment that cures Alzheimer's disease. In advanced stages, severe loss of brain function can cause dehydration, malnutrition or infection. These complications can result in death. Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Early signs include difficulty remembering recent events or conversations. But memory gets worse and other symptoms develop as the disease progresses.  At first, someone with the disease may be aware of having trouble remembering things and thinking clearly. As symptoms get worse, a family member or friend may be more likely to notice the issues. Brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease lead to growing trouble with: Everyone has memory lapses at times, but the memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease persists and gets worse. Over time, memory loss affects the ability to function at work or at home. People with Alzheimer's disease may: Alzheimer's disease causes difficulty concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts such as numbers. Doing more than one task at once is especially difficult. It may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time. Eventually, a person with Alzheimer's disease may be unable to recognize and deal with numbers. Alzheimer's disease causes a decline in the ability to make sensible decisions and judgments in everyday situations. For example, a person may make poor choices in social settings or wear clothes for the wrong type of weather. It may become harder for someone to respond to everyday problems. For example, the person may not know how to handle food burning on the stove or decisions when driving. Routine activities that require completing steps in order become a struggle. This may include planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game. Eventually, people with advanced Alzheimer's disease forget how to do basic tasks such as dressing and bathing. Brain changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease can affect moods and behaviors. Problems may include the following: Despite major changes to memory and skills, people with Alzheimer's disease are able to hold on to some skills even as symptoms get worse. Preserved skills may include reading or listening to books, telling stories, sharing memories, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts. These skills may be preserved longer because they're controlled by parts of the brain affected later in the course of the disease. A number of conditions can result in memory loss or other dementia symptoms. Some of those conditions can be treated. If you are concerned about your memory or other thinking skills, talk to your health care professional. If you are concerned about thinking skills you observe in a family member or friend, talk about your concerns and ask about going together to talk to a health care professional.

Please, try again in a couple of minutes In the brain of someone with Alzheimer's disease, amyloid plaques form and tau proteins change shape and become tangles. In the brain of someone with Alzheimer's disease, amyloid plaques form and tau proteins change shape and become tangles. The exact causes of Alzheimer's disease aren't fully understood. But at a basic level, brain proteins fail to function as usual. This disrupts the work of brain cells, also called neurons, and triggers a series of events. The neurons become damaged and lose connections to each other. They eventually die. Scientists believe that for most people, Alzheimer's disease is caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the brain over time. In less than 1% of cases, Alzheimer's is caused by specific genetic changes that almost guarantee a person will develop the disease. In these cases, the disease usually begins in middle age. The development of the disease begins years before the first symptoms. The damage most often starts in the region of the brain that controls memory. The loss of neurons spreads in a somewhat predictable pattern to other regions of the brain. By the late stage of the disease, the brain has shrunk significantly. Researchers trying to understand the cause of Alzheimer's disease are focused on the role of two proteins: Increasing age is the greatest known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's isn't a part of typical aging. But as you grow older, the chances of developing it increases. One study found that every year there were four new diagnoses per 1,000 people ages 65 to 74. Among people ages 75 to 84, there were 32 new diagnoses per 1,000 people. For those 85 and older, there were 76 new diagnoses per 1,000 people. The risk of developing Alzheimer's is somewhat higher if a first-degree relative — your parent or sibling — has the disease. Just how genes among families affect the risk is largely unexplained, and the genetic factors are likely complex. A better understood genetic factor is a form of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. A form of the gene, APOE e4, increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. About 25% to 30% of the population carries APOE e4. But not everyone with this form of the gene develops the disease. Scientists have found rare changes in three genes that virtually guarantee a person who inherits one of them will develop Alzheimer's. But these changes account for less than 1% of people with Alzheimer's disease. Many people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease. This is likely related to having three copies of chromosome 21. Chromosome 21 is the gene involved in the production of the protein that leads to the creation of beta-amyloid. Beta-amyloid fragments can become plaques in the brain. Symptoms tend to appear 10 to 20 years earlier in people with Down syndrome than they do for the general population. Overall there are more women with the disease because they tend to live longer than men. Someone with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has a decline in memory or other thinking skills that is greater than usual for the person's age. But the decline doesn't prevent the person from functioning in social or work environments. However, people with MCI have a significant risk of developing dementia. When MCI affects mainly memory, the condition is more likely to progress to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. A diagnosis of MCI offers people the chance to put a greater focus on healthy lifestyle changes and to come up with strategies to make up for memory loss. They also can schedule regular health care appointments to monitor symptoms. Several large studies found that people age 50 years or older who had a traumatic brain injury (TBI) had an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The risk is even higher in people with more-severe and multiple TBIs. Some studies found that the risk may be greatest within the first six months to two years after the injury. Studies in animals have found that air pollution particulates can speed the breakdown of the nervous system. And human studies have found that air pollution exposure — especially from traffic exhaust and burning wood — is linked to a greater dementia risk. Drinking large amounts of alcohol has long been known to cause brain changes. Several large studies and reviews found that alcohol use disorders were linked to an increased risk of dementia — early-onset dementia in particular. Research has shown that poor sleep patterns, such as trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, are linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Research has shown that the same risk factors associated with heart disease also may increase the risk of dementia. It's unclear if these factors increase risk of dementia by worsening Alzheimer's changes in the brain or by leading to brain vascular changes. They include: These factors can all be modified. Therefore, changing lifestyle habits can to some degree alter your risk. For example, regular exercise and a healthy low-fat diet rich in fruits and vegetables are related to a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. Studies have found that socializing and engaging in activities that stimulate the mind throughout life can lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Low education levels — less than a high school education — appear to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's symptoms such as memory loss, language loss, impaired judgment and other brain changes can make it harder to manage other health conditions. A person with Alzheimer's disease may not be able to: As Alzheimer's disease moves into its last stages, brain changes begin to affect physical functions. The changes can affect the ability to swallow, balance, and control bowel and bladder movements. These effects can lead to other health problems such as: Alzheimer's disease is not a preventable condition. However, a number of lifestyle risk factors can be modified. Evidence suggests that taking steps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease may also lower your risk of developing dementia. To follow heart-healthy lifestyle choices that may reduce the risk of dementia: One large, long-term study done in Finland found that making lifestyle changes helped reduce cognitive decline among people who were at risk of dementia. Those in the study were given individual and group sessions that focused on diet, exercise and social activities. In another study done in Australia, people at risk of dementia were given coaching sessions on diet, exercise and other lifestyle changes. They had better results on cognitive tests after one, two and three years compared to people who didn't receive the coaching. Other studies have shown that staying engaged mentally and socially is linked to preserved thinking skills later in life and a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. This includes going to social events, reading, dancing, playing board games, creating art, playing an instrument and other activities.

 Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK. Dementia is the name for a group of symptoms associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning. It can affect memory, thinking skills and other mental abilities. The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet fully understood, although a number of things are thought to increase your risk of developing the condition. These include: Read more about the causes of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually over many years and eventually become more severe. It affects multiple brain functions. The first sign of Alzheimer's disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, this could be forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects. As the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and further symptoms can develop, such as: Read more about the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is most common in people over the age of 65. The risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80. But around 1 in every 13 people with Alzheimer's disease are under the age of 65. This is called early- or young-onset Alzheimer's disease. As the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there's a problem. Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older. Also, the disease process itself may (but not always) prevent people recognising changes in their memory. But Alzheimer's disease is not a ""normal"" part of the ageing process. An accurate and timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can give you the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support that may help. If you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see a GP. If possible, someone who knows you well should be with you as they can help describe any changes or problems they have noticed. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. There's no single test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. And it's important to remember that memory problems do not necessarily mean you have Alzheimer's disease. A GP will ask questions about any problems you're experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions. If Alzheimer's disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist service to: Read more about diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. There's currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medicines are available that can help relieve some of the symptoms. Various other types of support are also available to help people with Alzheimer's live as independently as possible, such as making changes to your home environment so it's easier to move around and remember daily tasks. Psychological treatments such as cognitive stimulation therapy may also be offered to help support your memory, problem solving skills and language ability. Read more about treating Alzheimer's disease. People with Alzheimer's disease can live for several years after they start to develop symptoms. But this can vary considerably from person to person. Alzheimer's disease is a life-limiting illness, although many people diagnosed with the condition will die from another cause. As Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological condition, it can cause problems with swallowing. This can lead to aspiration (food being inhaled into the lungs), which can cause frequent chest infections. It's also common for people with Alzheimer's disease to eventually have difficulty eating and have a reduced appetite. There's increasing awareness that people with Alzheimer's disease need palliative care. This includes support for families, as well as the person with Alzheimer's. As the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not clear, there's no known way to prevent the condition. But there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as: These measures have other health benefits, such as lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease and improving your overall mental health. Read more about preventing Alzheimer's disease. There are dozens of dementia research projects going on around the world, many of which are based in the UK. If you have a diagnosis of dementia or are worried about memory problems, you can help scientists better understand the disease by taking part in research. If you're a carer for someone with dementia, you can also take part in research. You can sign up to take part in trials on the NHS Join Dementia Research website. Dementia can affect all aspects of a person's life, as well as their family's. If you have been diagnosed with dementia, or you're caring for someone with the condition, remember that advice and support is available to help you live well.

"Alzheimer’s disease causes a decline in memory, thinking, learning and organizing skills over time. It’s the most common cause of dementia and usually affects people over the age of 65. There’s no cure for Alzheimer’s, but certain medications and therapies can help manage symptoms temporarily. Alzheimer’s disease (pronounced “alz-HAI-mirs”) is a brain condition that causes a progressive decline in memory, thinking, learning and organizing skills. It eventually affects a person’s ability to carry out basic daily activities. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. The symptoms of Alzheimer’s worsen over time. Researchers believe the disease process may start 10 years or more before the first symptoms appear. AD most commonly affects people over the age of 65. Dementia describes the state of a person’s mental function. It’s not a specific disease. It’s a decline in mental function from a previously higher level that’s severe enough to interfere with daily living. A person with dementia has two or more of these specific difficulties, including a change or decline in: Dementia ranges in severity. In the mildest stage, you may notice a slight decline in your mental functioning and require some assistance on daily tasks. At the most severe stage, a person depends completely on others for help with simple daily tasks. Dementia develops when infections or diseases impact the parts of your brain involved with learning, memory, decision-making or language. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for at least two-thirds of dementia cases in people 65 and older. Other common causes of dementia include: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Alzheimer’s disease mainly affects people over age 65. The higher your age over 65, the more likely you’ll develop Alzheimer’s. Some people develop Alzheimer’s disease before age 65 — typically in their 40s or 50s. This is called early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. It’s rare. Less than 10% of AD cases are early-onset. Alzheimer’s disease is common. It affects approximately 24 million people across the world. One in 10 people older than 65 and nearly a third of people older than 85 have the condition. Advertisement Alzheimer’s disease organizations and healthcare providers use various terms to describe the stages of Alzheimer’s disease based on symptoms. While the terms vary, the stages all follow the same pattern — AD symptoms progressively worsen over time. No two people experience AD in the same way, though. Each person with Alzheimer’s disease will progress through the stages at different speeds. Not all changes will occur in each person. It can sometimes be difficult for providers to place a person with AD in a specific stage as stages may overlap. Some organizations and providers frame the stages of Alzheimer’s disease in terms of dementia: Other organizations and providers more broadly explain the stages as: Or: Don’t be afraid to ask your healthcare provider or your loved one’s provider what they mean when they use certain words to describe the stages of Alzheimer’s. Providers typically only reference the preclinical stage in research on Alzheimer’s disease. People with AD in the preclinical stage typically have no symptoms (are asymptomatic). However, changes are taking place in their brain. This stage can last for years or even decades. People in this stage aren’t usually diagnosed with Alzheimer’s yet because they’re functioning at a high level. There are now brain imaging tests that can detect deposits of a protein in your brain called amyloid that interfere with your brain’s communication system before symptoms start. When memory problems become noticeable, healthcare providers often identify it as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). It’s a slight decline in mental abilities compared with others of the same age. You may notice a minor decline in abilities if you’re in the early stages of Alzheimer’s. Others close to you may notice these changes and point them out. But the changes aren’t severe enough to interfere with daily life and activities. In some cases, the effects of a treatable illness or disease cause mild cognitive impairment. However, for most people with MCI, it’s a point along the pathway to dementia. Researchers consider MCI to be the stage between the mental changes seen in normal aging and early-stage dementia. Various diseases can cause MCI, including Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease. Similarly, dementia can have a variety of causes. The signs and symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) vary based on the stage of the condition. In general, the symptoms of AD involve a gradual decline in some, most or all of the following: People with memory loss or other signs of Alzheimer’s may have difficulty recognizing their mental decline. These signs may be more obvious to loved ones. Anyone experiencing dementia-like symptoms should see a healthcare provider as soon as possible. Symptoms of AD become noticeable in the mild stage. The most common early symptom is forgetting newly learned information, especially recent events, places and names. Other signs and symptoms of mild Alzheimer’s include: Most people in the mild stage of AD have no problem recognizing familiar faces and can usually travel to familiar places. Moderate Alzheimer’s is typically the longest stage and can last many years. People in the moderate stage of Alzheimer’s often require care and assistance. People in this stage may: In the final stage of Alzheimer’s, dementia symptoms are severe. People in this stage need extensive care. In the severe stage of Alzheimer’s disease, the person often: Hospice care may be appropriate at this time for comfort. Advertisement An abnormal build-up of proteins in your brain causes Alzheimer’s disease. The build-up of these proteins — amyloid protein and tau protein — causes brain cells to die. The human brain contains over 100 billion nerve cells and other cells. The nerve cells work together to fulfill all the communications needed to perform functions such as thinking, learning, remembering and planning. Scientists believe that amyloid protein builds up in your brain cells, forming larger masses called plaques. Twisted fibers of another protein called tau form into tangles. These plaques and tangles block the communication between nerve cells, which prevents them from carrying out their processes. The slow and ongoing death of the nerve cells results in the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. Nerve cell death starts in one area of your brain (usually in the area of your brain that controls memory — the hippocampus) and then spreads to other areas. Despite ongoing research, scientists still don’t know what exactly causes these proteins to build up. So far, they believe that a genetic mutation may cause early-onset Alzheimer’s. They think that late-onset Alzheimer’s happens due to a complex series of brain changes that may occur over decades. A combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors likely contribute to the cause. Researchers don’t know why some people get Alzheimer’s disease and others don’t. But they’ve identified several factors that increase your risk for Alzheimer’s, including genetic (hereditary) factors. Having a form of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene increases your risk. This gene has several forms, and one of those, APOE ε4, increases your risk of developing Alzheimer’s and is also associated with an earlier age of disease onset. However, having the APOE ε4 form of the gene doesn’t guarantee that you’ll develop the condition. Some people with no APOE ε4 may also develop Alzheimer’s. If you have a first-degree relative (biological parent or sibling) with Alzheimer’s disease, your risk of developing the condition increases by 10% to 30%. People with two or more siblings with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease are three times more likely to develop the condition than the general population. Having trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) also increases your risk for early-onset Alzheimer’s. Healthcare providers use several methods to determine if a person with memory issues has Alzheimer’s disease. This is because many other conditions, especially neurological conditions, can cause dementia and other symptoms of Alzheimer’s. In the beginning steps of an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, a provider will ask questions to better understand your health and daily living. Your provider may also ask someone close to you, like a family member or caregiver, for insight into your symptoms. They’ll ask about: A provider will also: There’s no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, but certain medications can temporarily slow the worsening of dementia symptoms. Medications and other interventions can also help with behavioral symptoms. Beginning treatment as early as possible for Alzheimer’s could help maintain daily functioning for a while. However, current medications won’t stop or reverse AD. As AD affects everyone differently, treatment is highly individualized. Healthcare providers work with people with Alzheimer’s and their caregivers to determine the best treatment plan. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two types of drugs to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease: The FDA has given accelerated approval for aducanumab (Aduhelm™), the first disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer’s disease. The medication helps to reduce amyloid deposits in your brain. Aducanumab is a new medication, and researchers studied its effects in people living with early Alzheimer’s disease. Because of this, it may only help people in the early stage. The following cholinesterase inhibitors can help treat the symptoms of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease: These drugs work by blocking the action of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for destroying acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is one of the chemicals that help nerve cells communicate. Researchers believe that reduced levels of acetylcholine cause some of the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. These drugs can improve some memory problems and reduce some behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. These medications don’t cure Alzheimer’s disease or stop the progression of the disease. Memantine (Namenda®) is FDA-approved for treating moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. It helps keep certain brain cells healthier. Studies have shown that people with Alzheimer’s who take memantine perform better in common activities of daily living such as eating, walking, toileting, bathing and dressing. If your loved one has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, you can take steps to keep them comfortable in their environment and help manage behavior changes. You can: No medication has been approved for the management of behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer’s dementia. Certain medications may help in some people, including: These medications can cause unpleasant or potentially dangerous side effects (like dizziness, which could lead to falls), so healthcare providers typically only prescribe them for short periods when behavioral problems are severe. Or only after your loved one has tried safer non-drug therapies first. Scientists are actively researching Alzheimer’s disease and possible treatments. Ask your provider if there are any clinical trials that could benefit you or your loved one. An early diagnosis often provides people with more opportunities to participate in clinical trials or other research studies. While there are some risk factors for Alzheimer’s you can’t change, like age and genetics, you may be able to manage other factors to help reduce your risk. Risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease include: Research shows that having a healthy lifestyle helps protect your brain from cognitive decline. The following strategies may help decrease your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease: Talk to your healthcare provider if you’re concerned about your risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. It’s important to remember that no two people with Alzheimer’s disease are affected in the same way. It’s difficult to predict how your loved one will be affected. The best way you can prepare is to talk to healthcare providers who specialize in researching and treating Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. As the condition progresses, your loved one may benefit from a team of providers who can care for their needs. The prognosis (outlook) for Alzheimer’s disease is generally poor. The course of the disease varies from person to person. But on average, people with AD over 65 die within four to eight years of the diagnosis. However, some people may live up to 20 years after the first symptoms appear. Common causes of death include: Alzheimer’s disease is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. Caring for someone with Alzheimer’s can have significant physical, emotional and financial costs. The following tips can help both you and your loved one: See a healthcare provider if you or a loved one are experiencing issues with your memory or thinking. They can determine if the issues are due to Alzheimer’s or another condition. If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, you’ll need to see your healthcare team regularly to monitor the progression of the condition and to ensure your care plan is working for you. If your loved one has Alzheimer’s disease, it may be helpful to ask their healthcare team the following questions: A note from Cleveland Clinic It can be overwhelming to learn that a loved one has Alzheimer’s disease. Know that their healthcare team will help them and you through the process and provide individualized options for care. It’s important to take care of yourself as well. Consider joining support groups or creating your own support network to help you. Last reviewed on 12/10/2022. Learn more about our editorial process.

"Key factsAnxiety disorders are the world’s most common mental disorders, affecting 301 million people in 2019.More women are affected by anxiety disorders than men.Symptoms of anxiety often have onset during childhood or adolescence.There are highly effective treatments for anxiety disorders.Approximately 1 in 4 people with anxiety disorders receive treatment for this condition.OverviewEveryone can feel anxious sometimes, but people with anxiety disorders often experience fear and worry that is both intense and excessive. These feelings are typically accompanied by physical tension and other behavioural and cognitive symptoms. They are difficult to control, cause significant distress and can last a long time if untreated. Anxiety disorders interfere with daily activities and can impair a person’s family, social and school or working life.An estimated 4% of the global population currently experience an anxiety disorder (1). In 2019, 301 million people in the world had an anxiety disorder, making anxiety disorders the most common of all mental disorders (1). Although highly effective treatments for anxiety disorders exist, only about 1 in 4 people in need (27.6%) receive any treatment (2). Barriers to care include lack of awareness that this is a treatable health condition, lack of investment in mental health services, lack of trained health care providers, and social stigma.Symptoms and patternsPeople with an anxiety disorder may experience excessive fear or worry about a specific situation (for example, a panic attack or social situation) or, in the case of generalized anxiety disorder, about a broad range of everyday situations. They typically experience these symptoms over an extended period – at least several months. Usually they avoid the situations that make them anxious. Other symptoms of anxiety disorders may include:trouble concentrating or making decisionsfeeling irritable, tense or restlessexperiencing nausea or abdominal distresshaving heart palpitationssweating, trembling or shakingtrouble sleepinghaving a sense of impending danger, panic or doom.Anxiety disorders increase the risk for depression and substance use disorders as well as the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours.There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, including: generalized anxiety disorder (persistent and excessive worry about daily activities or events);panic disorder (panic attacks and fear of continued panic attacks); social anxiety disorder (high levels of fear and worry about social situations that might make the person feel humiliated, embarrassed or rejected); agoraphobia (excessive fear, worry and avoidance of situations that might cause a person to panic or feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed); separation anxiety disorder (excessive fear or worry about being separated from people with whom the person has a deep emotional bond);specific phobias (intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations that lead to avoidance behaviour and significant distress); andselective mutism (consistent inability to speak in certain social situations, despite the ability to speak comfortably in other settings, primarily affecting children).People may experience more than one anxiety disorder at the same time. Symptoms often begin during childhood or adolescence and continue into adulthood. Girls and women are more likely to experience an anxiety disorder than boys and men.Contributing factors and preventionAnxiety disorders, like other mental health conditions, result from a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors. Anyone can have an anxiety disorder, but people who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other adverse experiences are more likely to develop one. Anxiety disorders are closely related to and affected by physical health. Many of the impacts of anxiety (such as physical tension, nervous system hyperactivity or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for diseases such as cardiovascular disease. In turn, people with these diseases may also find themselves experiencing anxiety disorders due to the difficulties associated with managing their conditions.Effective community based approaches to prevent anxiety include parental education and school-based programmes to enhance social and emotional learning and build positive coping in children and adolescents. Exercise programmes can also be effective in preventing anxiety disorders in adults. Diagnosis and treatmentThere are several effective treatments for anxiety disorders. People with symptoms of anxiety should seek care. Psychological interventions are essential treatments for anxiety disorders and refer primarily to talk therapy with professionals or supervised lay therapists. These interventions can help people learn new ways of thinking, coping or relating to their anxiety, to others or to the world. They can teach people how to face the situations, events, people or places that trigger their anxiety. Psychological interventions can be provided to individuals or groups, in person or online. They may also be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps. The psychological interventions with the most evidence for treating a range of anxiety disorders are those based on principles of cognitive-behavioural therapy. These include exposure therapy, during which people learn to face their fears.In addition, learning stress management skills, such as relaxation skills and mindfulness skills, can help reduce symptoms of anxiety disorders. Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can also be useful in treating adults with anxiety disorders. Health-care providers should keep in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication, the ability to deliver either intervention (in terms of expertise, and/or treatment availability), and individual preferences. Benzodiazepines, which have historically been prescribed for anxiety disorders, are generally not recommended for anxiety disorders because of their high potential for dependence as well as their limited long-term effectiveness.Self-careSelf-care can play an important role in supporting treatment. To help manage your symptoms of anxiety and promote your overall well-being, you can:avoid or cut down on alcohol and don’t use illicit drugs, which can make anxiety worse;exercise regularly, even if it’s just a short walk;stick to regular eating and sleeping habits as much as possible and eat a healthy diet; learn relaxation techniques, such as slow breathing and progressive muscle relaxation; anddevelop the habit of mindfulness meditation, even if it’s just a few minutes per day.WHO responseWHO’s Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030 highlights the steps required to provide appropriate interventions for people with mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder are included in the priority conditions covered by WHO’s mhGAP Programme. This programme aims to help countries increase services for people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders through care provided by health workers who are not specialists in mental health. WHO has developed brief psychological intervention manuals that may be delivered by lay therapists to individuals and groups.

"Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. However, people with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations. Often, anxiety disorders involve repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). These feelings of anxiety and panic interfere with daily activities, are difficult to control, are out of proportion to the actual danger and can last a long time. You may avoid places or situations to prevent these feelings. Symptoms may start during childhood or the teen years and continue into adulthood. Examples of anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), specific phobias and separation anxiety disorder. You can have more than one anxiety disorder. Sometimes anxiety results from a medical condition that needs treatment. Whatever form of anxiety you have, treatment can help. Common anxiety signs and symptoms include: Several types of anxiety disorders exist: See your doctor if: Your worries may not go away on their own, and they may get worse over time if you don't seek help.

"Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health conditions that cause fear, dread and other symptoms that are out of proportion to the situation. There are several types, including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobias and social anxiety disorder. Treatment is effective and usually includes medication and psychotherapy (talk therapy). An anxiety disorder is a type of mental health condition. If you have an anxiety disorder, you may respond to certain things and situations with fear and dread. You may also experience physical signs of anxiety, such as a pounding heart and sweating. It’s normal to have some anxiety. You may feel anxious or nervous if you have to tackle a problem at work, go to an interview, take a test or make an important decision. Some anxiety can even be beneficial — it helps us notice dangerous situations and focuses our attention so we stay safe. But an anxiety disorder goes beyond the regular nervousness and slight fear you may feel from time to time. An anxiety disorder happens when: Children, adolescents and adults can experience anxiety disorders. Women and people assigned female at birth are about twice as likely as men and people assigned male at birth to have one. Anxiety disorders can make it difficult to get through the day. Fortunately, there are several effective treatments for these conditions. There are several types of anxiety disorders according to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). This is the standard reference manual for diagnosing mental health conditions. Types of anxiety disorders include: Other mental health conditions share features with anxiety disorders. These include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). But the American Psychiatric Association classifies them as distinct conditions and not anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are some of the most common mental health conditions: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of anxiety disorders vary depending on the type. Psychological symptoms may include: Physical symptoms may include: It’s important to talk to your healthcare provider or a mental health professional if you frequently experience these symptoms. Like other types of mental health conditions, researchers don’t know exactly what causes anxiety disorders. But they think a combination of factors plays a role: Advertisement If you or your child are experiencing symptoms of an anxiety disorder, see a healthcare provider. They’ll start with a medical evaluation. They’ll do a physical exam and ask about your medical history, any medications you’re taking and if any of your family members have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. There aren’t any blood tests or imaging scans that can diagnose anxiety disorders. But your provider may run some of these tests to rule out physical conditions that may be causing your symptoms, like hyperthyroidism, for example. If there isn’t an underlying physical cause, your provider may refer you to a mental health professional. A mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, will do an interview or survey, asking questions about your symptoms, sleeping habits and other behaviors. They use criteria in the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM-5 to make diagnoses of anxiety disorders. Typically, the provider bases a diagnosis on: An anxiety disorder is like any other health condition that requires treatment. You can’t will it away. It’s not a matter of self-discipline or attitude. Researchers have made a lot of progress in the last few decades in treating mental health conditions. Your healthcare provider will tailor a treatment plan that works for you. Your plan may include a combination of medication and psychotherapy (talk therapy). Medications can’t cure an anxiety disorder. But they can improve the symptoms and help you function better. Medications for anxiety disorders often include: Your healthcare provider will work with you to find the right medication combination and dosage. Don’t change the dose or stop taking medications without talking to your provider first. They’ll monitor you to make sure the medicines are working without causing negative side effects. “Psychotherapy,” also called talk therapy, is a term for a variety of treatment techniques that aim to help you identify and change unhealthy emotions, thoughts and behaviors. A mental health provider talks through strategies to help you better understand and manage an anxiety disorder. Approaches include: Advertisement Currently, there’s no known way to prevent anxiety disorders. But you can lessen many of the related issues with treatment. Seeking help as soon as symptoms appear can help decrease the disruption to your life. Left untreated, anxiety disorders can lead to serious complications, including: Constant anxiety also increases your risk of cardiac events, like a heart attack. This is why it’s crucial to seek help if you have an anxiety disorder. Treatment is effective. The right treatment can help improve your quality of life, relationships and productivity. It can also support your overall well-being. Aside from seeking professional medical help and treatment, certain strategies can help you manage an anxiety disorder and make treatment more effective. They include: Your healthcare provider is your partner in your care. If you feel like treatment for an anxiety disorder isn’t working or have questions about your medication, contact your provider. Together, you can figure out how to best move forward. You don’t need to live with constant worry and fear. If you notice symptoms of an anxiety disorder, talk to a healthcare provider. It’s best to get diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. Doing so can limit the problems that anxiety disorders can cause. Often, a combination of medications and counseling for anxiety can help you feel your best. Last reviewed on 07/03/2024. Learn more about our editorial process.

"  Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health problems. They include generalised anxiety disorders, social phobias, specific phobias (for example, agoraphobia and claustrophobia), and panic disorders. Depression is often related to anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders are common mental health problems that affect many people. Approximately 25% of the population have an anxiety disorder that warrants treatment at some time in their life and up to another 25% have less severe anxieties such as fears of spider and snakes. Everyone experiences anxiety and fear at times – these are normal and helpful human emotions that help us deal with danger. However, some people experience excessive and irrational anxiety and worries that become ongoing and distressing, and that interfere with their daily lives. This may indicate an anxiety disorder. Often there appears to be no obvious or logical reason for the way the person feels. This may make an anxiety disorder even more worrying to the sufferer. The main features of an anxiety disorder are fears or thoughts that are chronic (constant) and distressing and that interfere with daily living. Other symptoms of an anxiety disorder may include: A panic attack is a sudden feeling of intense terror that may occur in certain situations or for no apparent reason. A panic attack does not mean a person is necessarily suffering an anxiety disorder. However, a panic attack is a common feature of each type of anxiety disorder. Symptoms of a panic attack may include: The cause of panic attacks is unknown, but they may be related to a chemical response in the brain, caused by actual threatening or stressful events or by thinking about stressful events. The brain response leads to physiological changes in the body, such as shallow breathing and rapid heartbeat. Panic attacks can be frightening. Some people say they feel like they are going to die or go crazy. People affected by panic attacks may avoid situations in which they think attacks might occur. In some cases, this may lead to the development of other anxiety disorders including agoraphobia. Anxiety becomes a disorder when it’s irrational, excessive and when it interferes with a person’s ability to function in daily life. Anxiety disorders include: Generalised anxiety is excessive anxiety and constant worry about many things. The focus of the anxiety might be family or friends, health, work, money or forgetting important appointments. A person may be diagnosed with a generalised anxiety disorder if: People with social phobia are afraid of being negatively judged or evaluated by others. This leads to fear of doing something that may humiliate them in public – for example public speaking, using public toilets, eating and drinking in public, writing in public, or any social encounters such as parties or workplaces. Some social phobia sufferers may only fear one type of situation. Others may be concerned about several types of situations. This can lead them to avoid the feared situations, which can then lead to severe isolation and avoiding people and activities they usually enjoy. A person with a specific phobia has a persistent and irrational fear of a particular object or situation. They may fear animals, places or people. Fear of the object or situation is so severe that a person may experience physical symptoms and panic attacks. Fears may include dogs, blood, storms, spiders or other objects or situations but, in all cases, the anxiety is both excessive and interfering. The adult phobia sufferer usually knows that their fear is excessive or unreasonable. However, their need to avoid the object, place or person can significantly restrict their life. Panic or anxiety attacks are common. Panic disorders are less common, affecting about 2% of the population. For a person to be diagnosed with a panic disorder, they would usually have had at least four panic attacks each month over an extended period of time. Often panic attacks may not be related to a situation but come on spontaneously.
Panic disorder may be diagnosed if panic attacks are frequent and if there’s a strong and persistent fear of another attack occurring. An anxiety disorder may lead to social isolation and clinical depression, and can impair a person’s ability to work, study and do routine activities. It may also hurt relationships with friends, family and colleagues. It’s common for depression and anxiety to happen at the same time. Depression can be a serious illness with a high risk of self-harm and suicide. Recovery from an anxiety disorder is possible with the right treatment and support. Effective treatments for anxiety disorders may include:

Please, try again in a couple of minutes The two main types of arthritis — osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis — damage joints in different ways. The most common type of arthritis, osteoarthritis involves wear-and-tear damage to a joint's cartilage — the hard, slick coating on the ends of bones where they form a joint. Cartilage cushions the ends of the bones and allows nearly frictionless joint motion, but enough damage can result in bone grinding directly on bone, which causes pain and restricted movement. This wear and tear can occur over many years, or it can be hastened by a joint injury or infection. Osteoarthritis also causes changes in the bones and deterioration of the connective tissues that attach muscle to bone and hold the joint together. If cartilage in a joint is severely damaged, the joint lining may become inflamed and swollen. In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system attacks the lining of the joint capsule, a tough membrane that encloses all the joint parts. This lining (synovial membrane) becomes inflamed and swollen. The disease process can eventually destroy cartilage and bone within the joint. Risk factors for arthritis include: Severe arthritis, particularly if it affects your hands or arms, can make it difficult for you to do daily tasks. Arthritis of weight-bearing joints can keep you from walking comfortably or sitting up straight. In some cases, joints may gradually lose their alignment and shape.

"Arthritis is extremely common, especially in people older than 50. It causes joint pain, stiffness and inflammation. Your provider will help you understand which type of arthritis you have, what’s causing it and which treatments you’ll need. You may need a joint replacement if you have severe arthritis that you can’t manage with other treatments. Arthritis is a disease that causes damage in your joints. Joints are places in your body where two bones meet. Some joints naturally wear down as you age. Lots of people develop arthritis after that normal, lifelong wear and tear. Some types of arthritis happen after injuries that damage a joint. Certain health conditions also cause arthritis. Arthritis can affect any joint, but is most common in people’s: A healthcare provider will help you find ways to manage symptoms like pain and stiffness. Some people with severe arthritis eventually need surgery to replace their affected joints. Visit a healthcare provider if you’re experiencing joint pain that’s severe enough to affect your daily routine or if it feels like you can’t move or use your joints as well as usual. There are more than 100 different types of arthritis. Some of the most common types include: Depending on which type of arthritis you have, it can break down the natural tissue in your joint (degeneration) or cause inflammation (swelling). Some types cause inflammation that leads to degeneration. Arthritis is extremely common. Experts estimate that more than one-third of Americans have some degree of arthritis in their joints. Osteoarthritis is the most common type. Studies have found that around half of all adults will develop osteoarthritis at some point.

Policy The most common arthritis symptoms and signs include: Where you experience symptoms depends on which type of arthritis you have, and which of your joints it affects. Some types of arthritis cause symptoms in waves that come and go called flares or flare-ups. Others make your joints feel painful or stiff all the time, or after being physically active. What causes arthritis varies depending on which type you have: Anyone can develop arthritis, but some factors may make you more likely to, including: Some people have a higher arthritis risk, including: Arthritis can develop at any age. When it starts depends on which type you have and what’s causing it. In general, osteoarthritis affects adults older than 50. Rheumatoid arthritis usually develops in adults age 30 to 60. Other types that have a more direct cause usually start closer to that specific trigger. For example, people with post-traumatic arthritis don’t develop it until after their joints are injured, and gout doesn’t develop until after you’ve had high uric acid levels for at least several months. Talk to a healthcare provider about your unique arthritis risk, and when you should start watching for signs or changes in your joints. Advertisement A healthcare provider will diagnose arthritis with a physical exam. They’ll examine your affected joints and ask about your symptoms. Tell your provider when you first noticed symptoms like pain and stiffness, and if any activities or times of day make them worse. Your provider will probably check your range of motion (how far you can move a joint). They may compare one joint’s range of motion to other, similar joints (your other knee, ankle or fingers, for example). Your provider might use imaging tests to take pictures of your joints, including: These tests can help your provider see damage inside your joints. They can also help your provider rule out other injuries or issues that might cause similar symptoms, like bone fractures (broken bones). Your provider may use blood tests to check your uric acid levels if they think you have gout. Blood tests can also show signs of infections or autoimmune diseases. There’s no cure for arthritis, but your healthcare provider will help you find treatments that manage your symptoms. Which treatments you’ll need depend on what’s causing the arthritis, which type you have and which joints it affects. The most common arthritis treatments include: You may need surgery if you have severe arthritis and other treatments don’t work. The two most common types of arthritis surgery are joint fusion and joint replacement. Joint fusion is exactly what it sounds like: surgically joining bones together. It’s most common for bones in your spine (spinal fusion) or your ankle (ankle fusion). If your joints are damaged or you’ve experienced bone loss, you might need an arthroplasty (joint replacement). Your surgeon will remove your damaged natural joint and replace it with a prosthesis (artificial joint). You might need a partial or total joint replacement. Your provider or surgeon will tell you which type of surgery you’ll need and what to expect. Advertisement Some forms of arthritis happen naturally or because of health conditions you can’t change, so there’s not always a way to prevent it. However, you can lower your chances of developing arthritis by: You should expect to manage arthritis symptoms for a long time (probably the rest of your life). Your provider will help you find treatments that reduce how much (and how often) arthritis impacts your daily routine. Some people with arthritis experience more severe symptoms as they age. Ask your provider how often you should have follow-up visits to check for changes in your joints. Visit your healthcare provider if you experience any of the following symptoms: Questions you can ask your provider include: Everyone’s body responds differently to different treatments, so there’s no one answer that works for everyone. Your provider will help you find a combination of treatments that relieves your arthritis pain. You might be able to take over-the-counter or prescription medicine as soon as you feel arthritis symptoms flaring up. Some people take arthritis medicine regularly to help prevent pain before it gets bad enough to affect their day-to-day activities. Staying active is one of the best ways to relieve arthritis symptoms. Don’t force yourself to do anything that causes severe pain, but stretching and moving your body can reduce pain and stiffness and prevent them from getting worse. You don’t need to become an ultramarathoner or Olympic weightlifter. Walking, swimming, riding a bike and stretching or doing yoga are all great ways to support your joints and strengthen muscles throughout your body. Talk to your provider or physical therapist about exercises that are good for you. They’ll suggest options that help you safely stay active. Some people find that their arthritis feels worse during certain types of weather. Humidity and cold are two common joint pain triggers. There are a variety of reasons why this might happen. People tend to be less active in rainy seasons and winter. The cold and damp can also stiffen your joints and aggravate arthritis. Other theories suggest that barometric pressure (the pressure of the air around you), may have some effect on arthritis. Talk to your healthcare provider if you feel like certain weather conditions or seasons make arthritis worse. They’ll suggest ways to prevent pain and stiffness throughout the year, or they may modify your arthritis treatments to fit any changes in your environment. A note from Cleveland Clinic Arthritis is one of the most common health conditions people experience. But, just because lots of people have it, that doesn’t mean you should live in pain. Talk to a healthcare provider about ways to manage arthritis symptoms. They’ll help you find ways to spend more time doing the activities you love, and less time feeling stiff and uncomfortable. Arthritis can be a pain in the neck (and knees, and hips, and back and any other joint in your body), but try to stay as active as possible. Ask your provider about physical or occupational therapy to help you stay strong, active and confident throughout your daily routine. Last reviewed on 11/13/2023.

 Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in a joint. In the UK, millions of people have arthritis or other, similar conditions that affect the joints. Arthritis affects people of all ages, including children. Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are the 2 most common types of arthritis. Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK. It most often develops in people in their mid-40s or older. It's also more common in women and people with a family history of the condition.  But it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with other joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness. Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder. This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs called osteophytes. Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position. The most commonly affected joints are those in the: Find out more about osteoarthritis Rheumatoid arthritis is less common than osteoarthritis. It often starts when a person is between 30 and 50 years old. Women are more likely to be affected than men. In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling.  The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected. This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. This may cause the bone and cartilage to break down. People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body. Find out more about rheumatoid arthritis There are lots of different types of arthritis. The symptoms you experience will vary depending on the type you have. This is why it's important to have an accurate diagnosis if you have: Arthritis is often associated with older people, but it can also affect children. Most types of childhood arthritis are known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA causes pain and inflammation in 1 or more joints for at least 6 weeks. Although the exact cause of JIA is unknown, the symptoms often improve as a child gets older, meaning they can lead a normal life. Oligo-articular JIA is the most common type of JIA. It affects up to 4 joints in the body, most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists. Oligo-articular JIA often goes away without causing long-term joint damage. But there's a risk that children with the condition may develop eye problems, so regular eye tests with an eyecare specialist called an ophthalmologist are recommended. Polyarticular JIA, or polyarthritis, is the second most common type of JIA and affects 5 or more joints. It can affect a child of any age and may come on suddenly or develop gradually. The symptoms of polyarticular JIA are similar to the symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis. A child with the condition may also feel unwell and may occasionally have a high temperature of 38C or above. Systemic onset JIA begins with symptoms such as a fever, rash, a lack of energy and enlarged glands. Later on, joints can become swollen and inflamed. Like polyarticular JIA, systemic onset JIA can affect children of any age. Enthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that often affects the joints of the leg and spine, causing inflammation where the tendons attach to the bone. It can cause stiffness in the neck and lower back in the teenage years. It's also linked to a painful eye condition called acute uveitis. Versus Arthritis: juvenile idiopathic arthritis There's no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow it down. Osteoarthritis treatments include lifestyle changes, medicines and surgery. Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis aims to slow the condition's progress and minimise joint inflammation. This helps prevent joint damage. Treatments include medicine, physiotherapy and surgery. If you have arthritis, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP. To find out if there are any services in your area: Versus Arthritis provides help and support for people in the UK with arthritis, plus their families and friends. They have a free helpline you can call for further information and support on 0800 5200 520, Monday to Friday, 9am to 6pm. The helpline is closed from 12pm on the last Friday of every month for training. You can also look up arthritis services near where you live.

"Arthritis describes over 100 conditions that involve inflammation and damage in the joints, the tissues around the joint, and other connective tissues. Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis are three types of arthritis. The cause will depend on the type. The most common form of arthritis is osteoarthritis. Other common rheumatic conditions types of arthritis include gout and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Arthritis affects 58.5 million adults in the United States, which equals about 1 in 4 people. It is more common among adults aged 65 years or older. However, it can affect people of all ages, including children. This article discusses the different types of arthritis, what causes it, and possible treatments. Arthritis refers to more than 100 rheumatic diseases and conditions that affect joints. These conditions tend to involve pain, aching, stiffness, and swelling in and around one or more joints.  The word “arthritis” means “joint inflammation.” However, inflammation may also affect the tendons and ligaments surrounding the joint. The symptoms can develop gradually or suddenly and may impair a person’s ability to perform everyday tasks. There are more than 100 types of arthritis. Generally, arthritis can be split into the following categories: Inflammation is a normal part of the body’s healing process. It tends to occur as a defense against viruses and bacteria or as a response to injuries such as burns. However, with inflammatory arthritis, inflammation occurs in people for no apparent reason. Inflammatory arthritis is characterized by damaging inflammation that does not occur as a normal reaction to injury or infection. This type of inflammation is unhelpful and instead causes damage to the affected joints, resulting in pain, stiffness, and swelling. Inflammatory arthritis can affect several joints, and the inflammation can damage the surface of the joints and also the underlying bone. Examples of inflammatory arthritis include: Degenerative or mechanical arthritis refers to a group of conditions that mainly involve damage to the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones. The main job of the smooth, slippery cartilage is to help the joints glide and move smoothly. This type of arthritis causes the cartilage to become thinner and rougher. To compensate for the loss of cartilage and changes in joint function, the body begins to remodel the bone in an attempt to restore stability. This can cause undesirable bony growths to develop, called osteophytes. The joint can become misshapen. This condition is commonly called osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis can also result from previous damage to the joint such as a fracture or previous inflammation in the joint. Connective tissues support, bind together, or separate other body tissues and organs. They include tendons, ligaments, and cartilage. CTD involves joint pain and inflammation. The inflammation may also occur in other tissues, including the skin, muscles, lungs, and kidneys. This can result in various symptoms besides painful joints, and it may require consultation with a number of different specialists. Examples of CTD include: A bacterium, virus, or fungus that enters a joint can sometimes cause inflammation. Organisms that can infect joints include: A doctor can treat a joint infection with antibiotics or other antimicrobial medication. However, the arthritis can sometimes become chronic, and joint damage may be irreversible if the infection has persisted for some time. Uric acid is a chemical created when the body breaks down substances called purines. Purines are found in human cells and several foods. Most uric acid dissolves in blood and travels to the kidneys. From there, it passes out of the body in urine. Some people have high uric acid levels because they either naturally produce more than they need or their body cannot clear the uric acid quickly enough. Uric acid builds up and accumulates in some people and forms needle-like crystals in the joint, resulting in sudden spikes of extreme joint pain or a gout attack. Gout can either come and go in episodes or become chronic if uric acid levels are not reduced. It commonly affects a single joint or a small number of joints, such as the big toe and hands. It usually affects the extremities. One theory is that uric acid crystals form in cooler joints, away from the main warmth of the body. Some of the more common types of arthritis are discussed below. This can refer to a number of types of arthritis. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), is the most common type. Arthritis in childhood can cause permanent damage to joints, and there is no cure. However, remission is possible, during which time the disease remains inactive. It may be due to immune system problems. Septic arthritis is a joint inflammation that results from a bacterial or fungal infection. It commonly affects the knee and hip. It typically affects 2-6 people per 100,000. It may develop when bacteria or other disease-causing microorganisms spread through the blood to a joint, or when the joint is directly infected with a microorganism through injury or surgery. Bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, or Neisseria gonorrhoeae cause most cases of acute septic arthritis. Organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Candida albicans cause chronic septic arthritis. This is less common than acute septic arthritis. The following conditions increase the risk of developing septic arthritis: Septic arthritis is a rheumatologic emergency as it can lead to rapid joint destruction. It can be fatal. The symptoms of arthritis that appear and how they appear vary widely, depending on the type. They can develop gradually or suddenly. As arthritis is most often a chronic disease, symptoms may come and go, or persist over time. However, anyone who experiences any of the following four key warning signs should see a doctor. In addition to these general signs, certain types of arthritis may cause their own unique symptoms. For example, Juvenile RA can cause eye problems, including uveitis, iridocyclitis, or iritis.  Septic arthritis often causes fever and intense joint pain. It can become an emergency if it progresses to sepsis. There is no single cause of all types of arthritis. The cause or causes vary according to the type or form of arthritis. Possible causes may include: Most types of arthritis are linked to a combination of factors. However, some have no obvious cause and appear to be unpredictable in their emergence. Treatment for arthritis aims to control pain, minimize joint damage, and improve or maintain function and quality of life. A range of medications and lifestyle strategies can help achieve this and protect joints from further damage. The exact treatment depends on the type of arthritis a person develops. It may involve: Medications will depend on the type of arthritis. Commonly used drugs include: A healthful, balanced diet, along with appropriate exercise and avoidance of smoking and drinking too much alcohol can help people with arthritis maintain their overall health and reduce symptom severity.  Eating some types of food may help reduce inflammation. The following foods, found in a Mediterranean diet, can provide many nutrients that are good for joint health and can help relieve joint inflammation.  On the other hand, people living with arthritis should avoid or limit eating processed foods, foods that contain added sugar, and refined carbohydrates. These foods may actually make arthritis inflammation worse. Learn more about diet and arthritis. Doctors will often recommend a course of physical therapy to help patients with arthritis overcome some of the challenges and to reduce limitations on mobility. Forms of physical therapy that may be recommended include: In addition, although individuals with arthritis may experience short-term increases in pain when first beginning exercise, continued physical activity can effectively reduce long-term symptoms. People with arthritis can participate in joint-friendly physical activity on their own or with friends. As many people with arthritis have other conditions, such as heart disease, it is important to choose appropriate activities. Joint-friendly physical activities that are appropriate for adults with arthritis and heart disease include: A healthcare professional can help you find ways to live a healthful lifestyle and have a better quality of life. A number of natural remedies have been suggested for different types of arthritis. Research has shown that some herbal supplement may be able to relieve some pain and inflammation or help reduce the need for taking pain medications. These include: However, anyone considering using natural remedies for any type of arthritis should speak to a doctor first. Depending on the type of arthritis a person has, different surgical treatments on the affected joints may be necessary. It may depend on the degree of a person’s symptoms and whether other treatments have been successful.  Surgery options for arthritis include: Learn about these and other surgical treatments for arthritis. There are more than 100 types of arthritis.  Some types, such as RA and lupus, are caused by an overactive immune system and affect multiple organs. Other types are caused by physical degeneration in specific joints.  Factors in the development of arthritis include:  A doctor can help a person determine whether they have arthritis and the best course of treatment for them. Treatments can include medications and lifestyle changes. In some cases, a person may need surgery.

"The word arthritis is used to describe pain, swelling and stiffness in a joint or joints. Arthritis isn’t a single condition and there are several different types. Around 10 million people in the UK are thought to have arthritis. It can affect people of all ages – even children and teenagers. Some forms of arthritis are more common in older people. If you have pain in or around a joint or joints that doesn’t go away after a few days, you should see a doctor. Finding out what’s causing your pain is key to finding the right treatment and self-help options. Although there’s no cure for arthritis, treatments have improved greatly in recent years and, for many types of arthritis, particularly inflammatory arthritis, there’s a clear benefit in starting treatment at an early stage. It may be difficult to say what has caused your arthritis. There are several factors that can increase the risk of each type of arthritis. It could be that the genes you inherited from your parents or grandparents made you more likely to get arthritis. Arthritis can make life tough by causing pain and making it harder to get about. The symptoms of arthritis can vary from week to week, and even from day to day. Many types, such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, are long-term conditions. However, with the right treatment and approach you can manage your symptoms. Whatever condition you have, remaining physically active will help you stay mobile and will be good for your general health.  A joint is where two or more bones meet, such as in the fingers, knees, and shoulders. Joints hold bones in place and allow them to move freely within limits. Most of the joints in our body are surrounded by a strong capsule. The capsule is filled with a thick fluid that helps to lubricate the joint. These capsules hold our bones in place. They do this with the help of ligaments. These are a bit like very strong elastic bands. The ends of the bones within a joint are lined with cartilage. This is a smooth but tough layer of tissue that allows bones to glide over one another as you move. If we want to move a bone, our brain gives a signal to the muscle, which then pulls a tendon, and this is attached to the bone. Muscles therefore have an important role in supporting a joint. Because there are several types of arthritis, it’s important to know which one you have. There are some similarities between these conditions, but there are also some key differences. The most common type of arthritis is osteoarthritis. It is estimated that around 8.75 million people in the UK have seen a doctor about osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis starts with the roughening of cartilage. If this happens, the body can put in place a ‘repair’ process to try to make up for the loss of this important substance. The following can then happen: Sometimes, the early stages of osteoarthritis can happen without causing much pain or trouble. However, it can lead to damage inside a joint, as well as pain and stiffness. Osteoarthritis is more common in women and usually affects people from the age of 45 onwards. The parts of the body most commonly affected are the knees, hands, hips, and back. Keeping active will help you maintain a healthy weight, and this will reduce the pressure on your joints. Doing regular exercise will keep muscles around a joint strong, and this will help to support and stabilise a joint affected by osteoarthritis. Being overweight can make you more likely to get osteoarthritis and can make it worse. Taking painkillers, such as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen can help reduce your symptoms and allow you to stay active. Keeping active will also reduce pain, stiffness and swelling. There are NSAID creams that you can rub into the affected area. It might be an idea to try these first. There is a range of pain relief options available. If you’re finding the pain of osteoarthritis difficult to cope with, a doctor or physiotherapist would be able to give you specific advice. If your osteoarthritis becomes severe, particularly in your knees and hips, your doctor might discuss with you the possibility of surgery. This is usually considered only after you’ve tried all the other treatment options. Joint replacements are now very sophisticated and successful. Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis that can cause painful swelling in joints. It typically affects the big toe, but it can also affect other joints in the body. Joints affected by gout can become red and hot. The skin may also look shiny and can peel. It’s caused by having too much urate, otherwise known as uric acid, in the body. We all have a certain amount of urate in our body. However, being overweight or eating and drinking too much of certain types of food and alcoholic drinks can cause some people to have more urate in their bodies. The genes you inherit can make you more likely to develop gout. If it reaches a high level, urate can form into crystals that remain in and around the joint. They can be there for a while without causing any problems and even without the person realising they are there. A knock to a part of the body or having a fever can lead to the crystals falling into the soft part of the joint. This will cause pain and swelling. There are drugs that can reduce the amount of urate in the body and prevent gout attacks. Examples are allopurinol and febuxostat. If you’re having a gout attack, you’ll also need short-term pain relief. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as well as paracetamol can be good drugs to try first. Men can get gout from their mid-20s, and in women it’s more common after the menopause. Taking water tablets can increase the risk of gout. There are also conditions that cause calcium crystals to form in and around joints. We all need calcium to make bones and teeth strong. However, some people can have too much calcium in their bodies, which can then form as crystals around joints. This can lead to painful swelling. Calcium crystal diseases tend to clear up on their own. Taking painkillers and NSAIDs, and applying an ice pack wrapped in a damp towel, can soothe the pain and swelling. Rheumatoid arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis. It is what is known as an auto-immune condition. The immune system is the body’s natural self-defence system, and it protects us from infections and illness. When someone has an auto-immune condition, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s healthy tissues, such as the joints, causing inflammation. Inflammation is normally an important tool in the immune system. It occurs when the body sends extra blood and fluid to an area to fight an infection. This is what is happening for example if you have a cut that gets infected, and the skin around it becomes swollen and a different colour. However, in rheumatoid arthritis the inflammation and extra fluid in a joint can cause the following problems: As well as causing pain and stiffness, inflammation can cause permanent damage to a joint. Starting effective treatment early on can help to minimise damage. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis can include: Rheumatoid arthritis often starts in the small joints of the hands and feet, and it can affect the same joints on both sides of the body at the same time. It can start quite slowly and then gradually get worse, or it can start more aggressively. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect adults of any age. It most commonly starts among people between the ages of 40 and 60. It’s more common in women than men. There are drugs that can slow down an over-active immune system and therefore reduce the pain and swelling in joints. These are called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and include biological therapies. If you have rheumatoid arthritis, treatment will start with conventional DMARDs. These can have the overall effect of reducing the activity of your immune system, which is overactive and causing damage to your body. If these drugs have been tried and don’t work, doctors will look at the possibility of trying the newer biological therapies. Biological therapies have a more targeted effect on the immune system. Spondyloarthritis is a word used to describe a number of conditions that cause pain and swelling, mainly around the joints of the spine. In these conditions there is inflammation of small pieces of connective tissues, called entheses. These are tough little cords that join either ligaments or tendons to bones. Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of spondyloarthritis and it causes pain and swelling, mainly around the joints of the spine. In this condition, in response to inflammation around the spine, the body can create more of the mineral calcium. This mineral is normally used by the body to make bones strong. However, in ankylosing spondylitis the extra calcium can make new bits of bone grow in the spine, and this will cause pain and stiffness. This condition typically causes pain in the second half of the night, and swelling of your back in the morning that lasts for more than half an hour. There are drugs that can slow this process down. Keeping active will help to minimise stiffening of the spine, while maintaining a good posture will help prevent increased curving of the spine. Ankylosing spondylitis usually occurs between the ages of 20 and 30. It is more common among men. Psoriatic arthritis is an auto-immune condition. It is also a type of spondyloarthritis. The body’s immune system can cause painful swelling and stiffness within and around joints, as well as a red scaly skin rash called psoriasis. The rash can affect several places in the body, including the elbows, knees, back, buttocks and scalp. It is also common to have severe tiredness, otherwise known as fatigue. Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biological therapies can treat the cause of the inflammation in joints. There is also a variety of treatments, such as creams and medications, for psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis usually affects people who already have psoriasis. However, some people develop the arthritis before the psoriasis. It’s possible to have the arthritis but no psoriasis at all. This condition can affect people of any age, but tends to affect adults. If someone is diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis before their sixteenth birthday, it’s called juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or JIA. There are different types of JIA. They are auto-immune conditions, and the immune system can cause pain and swelling in joints. The earlier someone is diagnosed with JIA, the better. This is so that effective treatment can be started and limit any damage to the body. There are drugs that can treat the symptoms, such as painkillers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biological therapies can slow down or stop the arthritis causing the swelling inside the body. There are about 12,000 young people in the UK who have JIA. It’s common to have aches and pains in your muscles and joints from time to time. This may especially be true if you take part in unusual or strenuous physical activities. So, how can you tell the difference between the early signs of arthritis and normal pain and stiffness? And, how do you know when you should see a doctor about your symptoms? If you have swelling or stiffness that you can’t explain and that doesn't go away in a few days, or if it becomes painful to touch your joints, you should see a doctor. The earlier you get a diagnosis and start the right type of treatment, the better the outcome will be. Here are some other things to think about that might help you decide whether you need to see a doctor: It’s important to see a doctor if you get any new symptoms or if you have any trouble with drugs you’re taking. If you have an appointment with a doctor, to help make sure you get the most out of it, you could take a list of questions with you and tick them off as they are discussed. You could also keep a symptoms diary with details of how you’re feeling in between appointments. Some people find that taking a friend or relative with them to an appointment can provide support and ensure that all important points are discussed. There are a number of other conditions that can cause pain and possibly swelling in and around joints. Lupus is an auto-immune condition. The immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own healthy tissues. There can be many symptoms of lupus. It’s possible for the heart, lungs and other organs of the body to be affected. Joint pain and swelling is common in lupus, particularly in the small joints of the hands and feet. Joint pain in lupus can move around from one joint to another. Lupus can be difficult to diagnose, as it can cause many different symptoms which often appear like other conditions. Fibromyalgia is a long-term condition that can cause pain and tenderness all over the body. Symptoms can be similar to arthritis. However, the symptoms are mainly in the muscles rather than the joints. The most common symptoms of fibromyalgia are: If you have fibromyalgia, you’re probably very sensitive to pain or physical pressure. Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a condition involving painful and stiff muscles. The hips, shoulders and thighs are commonly affected. Lifting both arms above your head can be painful and difficult. The pain and stiffness are often worse in mornings. Other symptoms include a general feeling of being unwell and fatigue. It mainly affects people over the age of 70. Some people who have polymyalgia rheumatica develop a condition called giant cell arteritis (GCA). This affects the blood vessels in the head and can lead to symptoms of pain and tenderness around the side of the head. Giant cell arteritis can also cause pain in the tongue or jaw when chewing, and in rare cases problems with vision or even loss of vision. If you get any of these symptoms, it’s important to see a doctor urgently. If left untreated, giant cell arteritis can lead to permanent damage to eyesight, even blindness. Both polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis can be treated effectively with steroids, normally tablets. Back pain is a common problem that affects many of us. It’s usually caused by a simple muscle or ligament strain and not usually by a serious problem. There might not even be a specific cause. Back pain will usually clear away in a couple of weeks. Remaining active while taking painkillers is often the best thing you can do. Tendinopathy is a condition in which tendons, the strong cords that attach muscles to bones, are painful. The affected part of the body may be hot, swollen and red. This can make moving that part of the body difficult. You might also feel a grating sensation. This can be caused by over-use of that part of the body. Stopping or altering the activity that caused the problem may be the first step to recovery. Remaining generally active and taking painkillers can also help. Applying an ice pack, such as a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel, can also reduce pain and swelling. Aches and pains like back pain and neck pain usually don't have a serious cause. Find out about causes, treatments and exercises. As well as medical treatments, there are many things you can do to help yourself manage your arthritis. You might not always feel like exercising if you have arthritis. And you might be worried that exercising will make your pain or your condition worse. However, exercise can make symptoms such as pain and swelling better. There are several reasons why this is the case: People usually find that low-impact exercise is best. Swimming, cycling, brisk walking, yoga, T’ai Chi, and Pilates are all examples of exercises that have helped people with arthritis. It’s good to find something you enjoy so that you keep doing it. You may feel some discomfort and sometimes pain when you exercise. This feeling is normal and should calm down a few minutes after you finish. It’s not a sign that you are hurting yourself. Exercise will help reduce pain and can help you manage your arthritis better. While you can push yourself and do strenuous exercise, it’s important not to overdo it. If you are in pain that you can’t cope with during or after your activity, you will need to see a doctor. The key is to start off gently and to gradually increase the amount you do. Regular exercise is also an important part of maintaining a healthy weight. This will improve your symptoms as it will take pressure off joints. Being overweight can make someone more likely to have inflammation in their body. The best way to lose weight is to have a healthy, low-fat, low-sugar and balanced diet. Make sure you have plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, drink plenty of water, and exercise regularly. If you burn off more calories than you consume on a daily basis, you will lose weight. If you are ever struggling and need support or motivation to keep active, see a GP or physiotherapist. If you can afford it, another option would be to have regular sessions with a personal fitness trainer at a gym. If you are able to find someone who is trained to personal trainer level two or above, they will be able to give you advice on the best exercises for you and can monitor your progress. Make sure you tell them about your condition. Try these exercises for neck, shoulders, knees, back, hips, feet, ankles, toes, wrists, fingers and hands to manage your condition and maintain healthy joints. There’s a lot of advice about diets and supplements that can help arthritis. We explain which foods are most likely to help and how to lose weight if you need to. Having a good understanding of your condition will help you know about your treatment options and why exercise and other self-management methods are important. It will also mean you’re in a good position to get the most out of your appointments with healthcare professionals. If you’re ever struggling with any aspects of managing your arthritis, or notice new symptoms, you should see a GP. They could also refer you to another relevant healthcare professional. This could include a physiotherapist, who is trained to help you with exercise and help you maintain movement and function of any part of your body affected by arthritis. Alternatively, you might benefit from seeing an occupational therapist. These are professionals who could help you overcome the difficulties that your condition might cause, by providing practical solutions. You can be referred to physiotherapists and occupational therapists on the NHS through your GP. If you are struggling with every-day tasks at home, you may be able to get access to an occupational therapist through your local social services department. Or you can search for private physiotherapists and occupational therapists near you through the following websites: It’s difficult to say for certain how arthritis will affect you over time. In some types of arthritis symptoms can come and go. Most people with arthritis don’t have major mobility problems, and effective treatment will help reduce the risk of joint damage, even in more severe cases. There is plenty you can do to remain positive and proactive in all aspects of managing your arthritis and your overall health. If you’re worried about what impact arthritis will have on your working life, it’s important to know that you have rights and options. If you work your arthritis might mean that you need to change aspects of your job or even train for a different role. Your employer has a duty to make sure that your arthritis doesn’t make it difficult for you to do your job, or that you’re uncomfortable at work. Having a chat with your manager about your condition, how it affects you, and how your employer might be able to help you is a useful first step to unlock the rights and support you’re entitled to by law. Being in pain from arthritis can often lead to anxiety and depression. It’s important to tackle feelings like this, because they can affect how well you manage your condition. Talking to your partner, relative, friend, or a doctor can really help. You might find it helpful to try something like cognitive behaviour therapy, or mindfulness. These are talking therapies that have helped people cope better with the effects of arthritis. If you have arthritis it does have the potential to have an impact on your quality of life. However, with the right treatment, support, knowledge and approach, you will be able to live a fulfilling, happy and successful life. The more you’re able to stay physically and socially active the more control you’ll have over your life, and the less control arthritis will have over you. Having arthritis may pose some challenges in work, you can get support to help from your employer, Government programmes and other organisations.     Versus Arthritis is registered with: Fundraising Regulator © Versus Arthritis 2024.

"OverviewAsthma is a chronic lung disease affecting people of all ages. It is caused by inflammation and muscle tightening around the airways, which makes it harder to breathe. Symptoms can include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. These symptoms can be mild or severe and can come and go over time. Although asthma can be a serious condition, it can be managed with the right treatment. People with symptoms of asthma should speak to a health professional.ImpactAsthma is often under-diagnosed and under-treated, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.People with under-treated asthma can suffer sleep disturbance, tiredness during the day, and poor concentration. Asthma sufferers and their families may miss school and work, with financial impact on the family and wider community. If symptoms are severe, people with asthma may need to receive emergency health care and they may be admitted to hospital for treatment and monitoring. In the most severe cases, asthma can lead to death.SymptomsSymptoms of asthma can vary from person to person. Symptoms sometimes get significantly worse. This is known as an asthma attack. Symptoms are often worse at night or during exercise.Common symptoms of asthma include:a persistent cough, especially at nightwheezing when exhaling and sometimes when inhalingshortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sometimes even when restingchest tightness, making it difficult to breathe deeply.Some people will have worse symptoms when they have a cold or during changes in the weather. Other triggers can include dust, smoke, fumes, grass and tree pollen, animal fur and feathers, strong soaps and perfume.Symptoms can be caused by other conditions as well. People with symptoms should talk to a healthcare provider.CausesMany factors have been linked to an increased risk of developing asthma, although it is often difficult to find a single, direct cause.Asthma is more likely if other family members also have asthma – particularly      a close relative, such as a parent or sibling.Asthma is more likely in people who have other allergic conditions,      such as eczema and rhinitis (hay fever).Urbanization is associated with increased asthma prevalence,      probably due to multiple lifestyle factors. Events in early life affect the developing lungs and can increase      the risk of asthma. These include low birth weight, prematurity, exposure      to tobacco smoke and other sources of air pollution, as well as viral      respiratory infections. Exposure to a range of environmental allergens and irritants are      also thought to increase the risk of asthma, including indoor and outdoor      air pollution, house dust mites, moulds, and occupational exposure to      chemicals, fumes or dust.Children and adults who are overweight or obese are at a greater      risk of asthma.TreatmentAsthma cannot be cured but there are several treatments available. The most common treatment is to use an inhaler, which delivers medication directly to the lungs. Inhalers can help control the disease and enable people with asthma to enjoy a normal, active life. There are two main types of inhaler: bronchodilators (such      as salbutamol), that open the air passages and relieve symptoms; andsteroids (such as beclometasone)      that reduce inflammation in the air passages, which improves asthma      symptoms and reduces the risk of severe asthma attacks and death. People with asthma may need to use their inhaler every day. Their treatment will depend on the frequency of symptoms and the types of inhalers available.Using an inhaler can be difficult, especially for children and during emergency situations. Using a spacer device makes it easier to use an aerosol inhaler. This helps the medicine to reach the lungs more easily. A spacer is a plastic container with a mouthpiece or mask at one end and a hole for the inhaler in the other. A homemade spacer, made from a 500ml plastic bottle, can be as effective as commercially manufactured spacers. Access to inhalers is a problem in many countries. In 2021, bronchodilators were available in public primary health care facilities in half of low- and low-middle income countries, and steroid inhalers available in one third.  It is also important to raise community awareness to reduce the myths and stigma associated with asthma in some settings.Self-carePeople with asthma and their families need education to understand more about their asthma. This includes their treatment options, triggers to avoid, and how to manage their symptoms at home. It is important for people with asthma to know how to increase their treatment when their symptoms are worsening to avoid a serious attack. Healthcare providers may give an asthma action plan to help people with asthma to take greater control of their treatment.  WHO response Asthma is included in the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.WHO is taking action to extend diagnosis of and treatment for asthma in a number of ways.The WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions (PEN) was developed to help improve NCD management in primary health care in low-resource settings. PEN includes protocols for the assessment, diagnosis and management of chronic respiratory diseases (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and modules on healthy lifestyle counselling, including tobacco cessation and self-care. Reducing tobacco smoke exposure is important for both primary prevention of asthma and disease management. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is enabling progress in this area as are WHO initiatives such as MPOWER and mTobacco Cessation.Air pollution is an important risk factor for asthma, causing new cases and making existing disease worse. WHO has developed training for health care workers on air pollution which highlights this link and offers practical advice to reduce and mitigate exposure.  The Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD) contributes to WHO’s work to prevent and control chronic respiratory diseases.

 Asthma is a long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs.[4] It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and easily triggered bronchospasms.[9][10] Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.[3] These may occur a few times a day or a few times per week.[4] Depending on the person, asthma symptoms may become worse at night or with exercise.[4]
 Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.[3] Environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens.[4] Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers.[4] Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry lung function testing.[5] Asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.[11] It may also be classified as atopic or non-atopic, where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.[12][13]
 There is no known cure for asthma, but it can be controlled.[4] Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and respiratory irritants, and suppressed with the use of inhaled corticosteroids.[6][14] Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled.[15][16] Treatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth.[7] In very severe cases, intravenous corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and hospitalization may be required.[17]
 In 2019 asthma affected approximately 262 million people and caused approximately 461,000 deaths.[8] Most of the deaths occurred in the developing world.[4] Asthma often begins in childhood,[4] and the rates have increased significantly since the 1960s.[18] Asthma was recognized as early as Ancient Egypt.[19] The word asthma is from the Greek ἆσθμα, âsthma, which means 'panting'.[20]
 Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.[21] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up.[22] During recovery from an asthma attack (exacerbation), it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils.[23] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air.[24] Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.[25]
 A number of other health conditions occur more frequently in people with asthma, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), rhinosinusitis, and obstructive sleep apnea.[26] Psychological disorders are also more common,[27] with anxiety disorders occurring in between 16 and 52% and mood disorders in 14–41%.[28] It is not known whether asthma causes psychological problems or psychological problems lead to asthma.[29] Current asthma, but not former asthma, is associated with increased all-cause mortality, heart disease mortality, and chronic lower respiratory tract disease mortality.[30] Asthma, particularly severe asthma, is strongly associated with development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).[31][32][33] Those with asthma, especially if it is poorly controlled, are at increased risk for radiocontrast reactions.[34]
 Cavities occur more often in people with asthma.[35] This may be related to the effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists decreasing saliva.[36] These medications may also increase the risk of dental erosions.[36]
 Asthma is caused by a combination of complex and incompletely understood environmental and genetic interactions.[37][38] These influence both its severity and its responsiveness to treatment.[39] It is believed that the recent increased rates of asthma are due to changing epigenetics (heritable factors other than those related to the DNA sequence) and a changing living environment.[40] Asthma that starts before the age of 12 years old is more likely due to genetic influence, while onset after age 12 is more likely due to environmental influence.[41]
 Many environmental factors have been associated with asthma's development and exacerbation, including allergens, air pollution, and other environmental chemicals.[42] There are some substances that are known to cause asthma in exposed people and they are called asthmagens. Some common asthmagens include ammonia, latex, pesticides, solder and welding fumes, metal or wood dusts, spraying of isocyanate paint in vehicle repair, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, anhydrides, glues, dyes, metal working fluids, oil mists, molds.[43][44] Smoking during pregnancy and after delivery is associated with a greater risk of asthma-like symptoms.[45] Low air quality from environmental factors such as traffic pollution or high ozone levels[46] has been associated with both asthma development and increased asthma severity.[47] Over half of cases in children in the United States occur in areas when air quality is below the EPA standards.[48] Low air quality is more common in low-income and minority communities.[49]
 Exposure to indoor volatile organic compounds may be a trigger for asthma; formaldehyde exposure, for example, has a positive association.[50] Phthalates in certain types of PVC are associated with asthma in both children and adults.[51][52] While exposure to pesticides is linked to the development of asthma, a cause and effect relationship has yet to be established.[53][54] A meta-analysis concluded gas stoves are a major risk factor for asthma, finding around one in eight cases in the U.S. could be attributed to these.[55]
 The majority of the evidence does not support a causal role between paracetamol (acetaminophen) or antibiotic use and asthma.[56][57] A 2014 systematic review found that the association between paracetamol use and asthma disappeared when respiratory infections were taken into account.[58] Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy is a risk factor for the child to develop asthma.[59]
 Asthma is associated with exposure to indoor allergens.[60] Common indoor allergens include dust mites, cockroaches, animal dander (fragments of fur or feathers), and mold.[61][62] Efforts to decrease dust mites have been found to be ineffective on symptoms in sensitized subjects.[63][64] Weak evidence suggests that efforts to decrease mold by repairing buildings may help improve asthma symptoms in adults.[65] Certain viral respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus,[20] may increase the risk of developing asthma when acquired as young children.[66] Certain other infections, however, may decrease the risk.[20]
 The hygiene hypothesis attempts to explain the increased rates of asthma worldwide as a direct and unintended result of reduced exposure, during childhood, to non-pathogenic bacteria and viruses.[67][68] It has been proposed that the reduced exposure to bacteria and viruses is due, in part, to increased cleanliness and decreased family size in modern societies.[69] Exposure to bacterial endotoxin in early childhood may prevent the development of asthma, but exposure at an older age may provoke bronchoconstriction.[70] Evidence supporting the hygiene hypothesis includes lower rates of asthma on farms and in households with pets.[69]
 Use of antibiotics in early life has been linked to the development of asthma.[71] Also, delivery via caesarean section is associated with an increased risk (estimated at 20–80%) of asthma – this increased risk is attributed to the lack of healthy bacterial colonization that the newborn would have acquired from passage through the birth canal.[72][73] There is a link between asthma and the degree of affluence which may be related to the hygiene hypothesis as less affluent individuals often have more exposure to bacteria and viruses.[74]
 Family history is a risk factor for asthma, with many different genes being implicated.[76] If one identical twin is affected, the probability of the other having the disease is approximately 25%.[76] By the end of 2005, 25 genes had been associated with asthma in six or more separate populations, including GSTM1, IL10, CTLA-4, SPINK5, LTC4S, IL4R and ADAM33, among others.[77] Many of these genes are related to the immune system or modulating inflammation. Even among this list of genes supported by highly replicated studies, results have not been consistent among all populations tested.[77] In 2006 over 100 genes were associated with asthma in one genetic association study alone;[77] more continue to be found.[78]
 Some genetic variants may only cause asthma when they are combined with specific environmental exposures.[37] An example is a specific single nucleotide polymorphism in the CD14 region and exposure to endotoxin (a bacterial product). Endotoxin exposure can come from several environmental sources including tobacco smoke, dogs, and farms. Risk for asthma, then, is determined by both a person's genetics and the level of endotoxin exposure.[75]
 A triad of atopic eczema, allergic rhinitis and asthma is called atopy.[79] The strongest risk factor for developing asthma is a history of atopic disease;[66] with asthma occurring at a much greater rate in those who have either eczema or hay fever.[80] Asthma has been associated with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg–Strauss syndrome), an autoimmune disease and vasculitis.[81] Individuals with certain types of urticaria may also experience symptoms of asthma.[79]
 There is a correlation between obesity and the risk of asthma with both having increased in recent years.[82][83] Several factors may be at play including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of fat and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state.[84]
 Beta blocker medications such as propranolol can trigger asthma in those who are susceptible.[85] Cardioselective beta-blockers, however, appear safe in those with mild or moderate disease.[86][87] Other medications that can cause problems in asthmatics are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and NSAIDs.[88] Use of acid-suppressing medication (proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers) during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of asthma in the child.[89]
 Some individuals will have stable asthma for weeks or months and then suddenly develop an episode of acute asthma. Different individuals react to various factors in different ways.[90] Most individuals can develop severe exacerbation from a number of triggering agents.[90]
 Home factors that can lead to exacerbation of asthma include dust, animal dander (especially cat and dog hair), cockroach allergens and mold.[90][91] Perfumes are a common cause of acute attacks in women and children. Both viral and bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract can worsen the disease.[90] Psychological stress may worsen symptoms – it is thought that stress alters the immune system and thus increases the airway inflammatory response to allergens and irritants.[47][92]
 Asthma exacerbations in school‐aged children peak in autumn, shortly after children return to school. This might reflect a combination of factors, including poor treatment adherence, increased allergen and viral exposure, and altered immune tolerance. There is limited evidence to guide possible approaches to reducing autumn exacerbations, but while costly, seasonal omalizumab treatment from four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations.[93]
 Asthma is the result of chronic inflammation of the conducting zone of the airways (most especially the bronchi and bronchioles), which subsequently results in increased contractability of the surrounding smooth muscles. This among other factors leads to bouts of narrowing of the airway and the classic symptoms of wheezing. The narrowing is typically reversible with or without treatment. Occasionally the airways themselves change.[21] Typical changes in the airways include an increase in eosinophils and thickening of the lamina reticularis. Chronically the airways' smooth muscle may increase in size along with an increase in the numbers of mucous glands. Other cell types involved include T lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. There may also be involvement of other components of the immune system, including cytokines, chemokines, histamine, and leukotrienes among others.[20]
 While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed-upon definition.[20] It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as ""a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment"".[21]
 There is currently no precise test for the diagnosis, which is typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time.[5][20] Asthma may be suspected if there is a history of recurrent wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing and these symptoms occur or worsen due to exercise, viral infections, allergens or air pollution.[94] Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis.[94] In children under the age of six the diagnosis is more difficult as they are too young for spirometry.[95]
 Spirometry is recommended to aid in diagnosis and management.[96][97] It is the single best test for asthma. If the FEV1 measured by this technique improves more than 12% and increases by at least 200 milliliters following administration of a bronchodilator such as salbutamol, this is supportive of the diagnosis. It  however may be normal in those with a history of mild asthma, not currently acting up.[20] As caffeine is a bronchodilator in people with asthma, the use of caffeine before a lung function test may interfere with the results.[98] Single-breath diffusing capacity can help differentiate asthma from COPD.[20] It is reasonable to perform spirometry every one or two years to follow how well a person's asthma is controlled.[99]
 The methacholine challenge involves the inhalation of increasing concentrations of a substance that causes airway narrowing in those predisposed. If negative it means that a person does not have asthma; if positive, however, it is not specific for the disease.[20]
 Other supportive evidence includes: a ≥20% difference in peak expiratory flow rate on at least three days in a week for at least two weeks, a ≥20% improvement of peak flow following treatment with either salbutamol, inhaled corticosteroids or prednisone, or a ≥20% decrease in peak flow following exposure to a trigger.[100] Testing peak expiratory flow is more variable than spirometry, however, and thus not recommended for routine diagnosis. It may be useful for daily self-monitoring in those with moderate to severe disease and for checking the effectiveness of new medications. It may also be helpful in guiding treatment in those with acute exacerbations.[101]
 Asthma is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate.[11] Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic), based on whether symptoms are precipitated by allergens (atopic) or not (non-atopic).[12] While asthma is classified based on severity, at the moment there is no clear method for classifying different subgroups of asthma beyond this system.[102] Finding ways to identify subgroups that respond well to different types of treatments is a current critical goal of asthma research.[102] Recently, asthma has been classified based on whether it is associated with type 2 or non–type 2 inflammation. This approach to immunologic classification is driven by a developing understanding of the underlying immune processes and by the development of therapeutic approaches that target type 2 inflammation.[103]
 Although asthma is a chronic obstructive condition, it is not considered as a part of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as this term refers specifically to combinations of disease that are irreversible such as bronchiectasis and emphysema.[104] Unlike these diseases, the airway obstruction in asthma is usually reversible; however, if left untreated, the chronic inflammation from asthma can lead the lungs to become irreversibly obstructed due to airway remodeling.[105] In contrast to emphysema, asthma affects the bronchi, not the alveoli.[106] The combination of asthma with a component of irreversible airway obstruction has been termed the asthma-chronic obstructive disease (COPD) overlap syndrome (ACOS). Compared to other people with ""pure"" asthma or COPD, people with ACOS exhibit increased morbidity, mortality and possibly more comorbidities.[107]
 An acute asthma exacerbation is commonly referred to as an asthma attack. The classic symptoms are shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness.[20] The wheezing is most often when breathing out.[109] While these are the primary symptoms of asthma,[110] some people present primarily with coughing, and in severe cases, air motion may be significantly impaired such that no wheezing is heard.[108] In children, chest pain is often present.[111]
 Signs occurring during an asthma attack include the use of accessory muscles of respiration (sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles of the neck), there may be a paradoxical pulse (a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation), and over-inflation of the chest.[112] A blue color of the skin and nails may occur from lack of oxygen.[113]
 In a mild exacerbation the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is ≥200 L/min, or ≥50% of the predicted best.[114] Moderate is defined as between 80 and 200 L/min, or 25% and 50% of the predicted best, while severe is defined as ≤ 80 L/min, or ≤25% of the predicted best.[114]
 Acute severe asthma, previously known as status asthmaticus, is an acute exacerbation of asthma that does not respond to standard treatments of bronchodilators and corticosteroids.[115] Half of cases are due to infections with others caused by allergen, air pollution, or insufficient or inappropriate medication use.[115]
 Brittle asthma is a kind of asthma distinguishable by recurrent, severe attacks.[108] Type 1 brittle asthma is a disease with wide peak flow variability, despite intense medication. Type 2 brittle asthma is background well-controlled asthma with sudden severe exacerbations.[108]
 Exercise can trigger bronchoconstriction both in people with or without asthma.[116] It occurs in most people with asthma and up to 20% of people without asthma.[116] Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is common in professional athletes. The highest rates are among cyclists (up to 45%), swimmers, and cross-country skiers.[117] While it may occur with any weather conditions, it is more common when it is dry and cold.[118] Inhaled beta2 agonists do not appear to improve athletic performance among those without asthma;[119] however, oral doses may improve endurance and strength.[120][121]
 Asthma as a result of (or worsened by) workplace exposures is a commonly reported occupational disease.[122] Many cases, however, are not reported or recognized as such.[123][124] It is estimated that 5–25% of asthma cases in adults are work-related. A few hundred different agents have been implicated, with the most common being isocyanates, grain and wood dust, colophony, soldering flux, latex, animals, and aldehydes. The employment associated with the highest risk of problems include those who spray paint, bakers and those who process food, nurses, chemical workers, those who work with animals, welders, hairdressers and timber workers.[122]
 Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), also known as aspirin-induced asthma, affects up to 9% of asthmatics.[125] AERD consists of asthma, nasal polyps, sinus disease, and respiratory reactions to aspirin and other NSAID medications (such as ibuprofen and naproxen).[126] People often also develop loss of smell and most experience respiratory reactions to alcohol.[127]
 Alcohol may worsen asthmatic symptoms in up to a third of people.[128] This may be even more common in some ethnic groups such as the Japanese and those with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease.[128] Other studies have found improvement in asthmatic symptoms from alcohol.[128]
 Non-atopic asthma, also known as intrinsic or non-allergic, makes up between 10 and 33% of cases. There is negative skin test to common inhalant allergens. Often it starts later in life, and women are more commonly affected than men. Usual treatments may not work as well.[129] The concept that ""non-atopic"" is synonymous with ""non-allergic"" is called into question by epidemiological data that the prevalence of asthma is closely related to the serum IgE level standardized for age and sex (P<0.0001), indicating that asthma is almost always associated with some sort of IgE-related reaction and therefore has an allergic basis, although not all the allergic stimuli that cause asthma appear to have been included in the battery of aeroallergens studied (the ""missing antigen(s)"" hypothesis).[130] For example, an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of population-attributable risk (PAR) of Chlamydia pneumoniae biomarkers in chronic asthma found that the PAR for C. pneumoniae-specific IgE was 47%.[131]
 Infectious asthma is an easily identified clinical presentation.[132] When queried, asthma patients may report that their first asthma symptoms began after an acute lower respiratory tract illness. This type of history has been labelled the ""infectious asthma"" (IA) syndrome,[133] or as ""asthma associated with infection"" (AAWI)[134] to distinguish infection-associated asthma initiation from the well known association of respiratory infections with asthma exacerbations. Reported clinical prevalences of IA for adults range from around 40% in a primary care practice[133] to 70% in a specialty practice treating mainly severe asthma patients.[135] Additional information on the clinical prevalence  of IA in adult-onset asthma is unavailable because clinicians are not trained to elicit this type of history routinely, and recollection in child-onset asthma is challenging. A population-based incident case-control study in a geographically defined area of Finland reported that 35.8% of new-onset asthma cases had experienced acute bronchitis or pneumonia in the year preceding asthma onset, representing a significantly higher risk compared to randomly selected controls (odds ratio 7.2, 95% confidence interval 5.2-10).[136]
 Asthma phenotyping and endotyping has emerged as a novel approach to asthma classification inspired by precision medicine which separates the clinical presentations of asthma, or asthma phenotypes, from their underlying causes, or asthma endotypes. The best-supported endotypic distinction is the type 2-high/type 2-low distinction. Classification based on type 2 inflammation is useful in predicting which patients will benefit from targeted biologic therapy.[137][138]
 Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses.[139] Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.[140] According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term asthma because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.[141] In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.[139]
 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can coexist with asthma and can occur as a complication of chronic asthma. After the age of 65, most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD. In this setting, COPD can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi. However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management: corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, and smoking cessation.[142] It closely resembles asthma in symptoms, is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke, an older age, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration, and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy.[143][144]
 The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak.[145] The World Health Organization recommends decreasing risk factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, chemical irritants including perfume, and the number of lower respiratory infections.[146][147] Other efforts that show promise include: limiting smoke exposure in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.[145]
 Early pet exposure may be useful.[148] Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive[149] and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet.[150]
 Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breastfeeding have not been found to be effective at preventing asthma in children and are not recommended.[150] Omega-3 consumption, Mediterranean diet and antioxidants have been suggested by some studies to potentially help prevent crises but the evidence is still inconclusive.[151]
 Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the workplace may be effective.[122] It is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations affect the risk of exacerbations.[152] Immunization, however, is recommended by the World Health Organization.[153] Smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma.[154]
 While there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved.[155] The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as cigarette smoke, pets or other allergens, and eliminating exposure to them. If trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended. Pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms. Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories.[156][157] The medications listed below have demonstrated efficacy in improving asthma symptoms; however, real world use-effectiveness is limited as around half of people with asthma worldwide remain sub-optimally controlled, even when treated.[158][159][160] People with asthma may remain sub-optimally controlled either because optimum doses of asthma medications do not work (called ""refractory"" asthma) or because individuals are either unable (e.g. inability to afford treatment, poor inhaler technique) or unwilling (e.g., wish to avoid side effects of corticosteroids) to take optimum doses of prescribed asthma medications (called ""difficult to treat"" asthma). In practice, it is not possible to distinguish ""refractory"" from ""difficult to treat"" categories for patients who have never taken optimum doses of asthma medications. A related issue is that the asthma efficacy trials upon which the pharmacological treatment guidelines are based have systematically excluded the majority of people with asthma.[161][162] For example, asthma efficacy treatment trials always exclude otherwise eligible people who smoke, and smoking diminishes the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids, the mainstay of asthma control management.[163][164][165]
 Bronchodilators are recommended for short-term relief of symptoms. In those with occasional attacks, no other medication is needed. If mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, a leukotriene antagonist or a mast cell stabilizer by mouth is recommended. For those who have daily attacks, a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids is used. In a moderate or severe exacerbation, corticosteroids by mouth are added to these treatments.[7]
 People with asthma have higher rates of anxiety, psychological stress, and depression.[166][167] This is associated with poorer asthma control.[166] Cognitive behavioral therapy may improve quality of life, asthma control, and anxiety levels in people with asthma.[166]
 Improving people's knowledge about asthma and using a written action plan has been identified as an important component of managing asthma.[168] Providing educational sessions that include information specific to a person's culture is likely effective.[169] More research is necessary to determine if increasing preparedness and knowledge of asthma among school staff and families using home-based and school interventions results in long term improvements in safety for children with asthma.[170][171][172] School-based asthma self-management interventions, which attempt to improve knowledge of asthma, its triggers and the importance of regular practitioner review, may reduce hospital admissions and emergency department visits. These interventions may also reduce the number of days children experience asthma symptoms and may lead to small improvements in asthma-related quality of life.[173] More research is necessary to determine if shared decision-making is helpful for managing adults with asthma[174] or if a personalized asthma action plan is effective and necessary.[175] Some people with asthma use pulse oximeters to monitor their own blood oxygen levels during an asthma attack. However, there is no evidence regarding the use in these instances.[176]
 Avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing attacks. The most common triggers include allergens, smoke (from tobacco or other sources), air pollution, nonselective beta-blockers, and sulfite-containing foods.[177][178] Cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke (passive smoke) may reduce the effectiveness of medications such as corticosteroids.[179] Laws that limit smoking decrease the number of people hospitalized for asthma.[154] Dust mite control measures, including air filtration, chemicals to kill mites, vacuuming, mattress covers and other methods had no effect on asthma symptoms.[63] There is insufficient evidence to suggest that dehumidifiers are helpful for controlling asthma.[180]
 Overall, exercise is beneficial in people with stable asthma.[181] Yoga could provide small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma.[182] More research is necessary to determine how effective weight loss is in improving quality of life, the usage of health care services, and adverse effects for people of all ages with asthma.[183][184]
 Findings suggest that the Wim Hof Method may reduce inflammation in healthy and non-healthy participants as it increases epinephrine levels, causing an increase in interleukin-10 and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines.[185]
 Medications used to treat asthma are divided into two general classes: quick-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms; and long-term control medications used to prevent further exacerbation.[156] Antibiotics are generally not needed for sudden worsening of symptoms or for treating asthma at any time.[186][187]
 For children with asthma which is well-controlled on combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), the benefits and harms of stopping LABA and stepping down to ICS-only therapy are uncertain.[223] In adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), stopping LABA may increase the risk of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with corticosteroids by mouth.[224] Stopping LABA probably makes little or no important difference to asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.[224] Whether or not stopping LABA increases the risk of serious adverse events or exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation is uncertain.[224]
 Medications are typically provided as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in combination with an inhaler spacer or as a dry powder inhaler. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A nebulizer may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.[225] For delivering short-acting beta-agonists in acute asthma in children, spacers may have advantages compared to nebulisers, but children with life-threatening asthma have not been studied.[226] There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma.[227] There is insufficient evidence to directly compare the effectiveness of a metered-dose inhaler attached to a homemade spacer compared to commercially available spacer for treating children with asthma.[228]
 Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects.[229] Risks include thrush, the development of cataracts, and a slightly slowed rate of growth.[229][230][231] Rinsing the mouth after the use of inhaled steroids can decrease the risk of thrush.[232] Higher doses of inhaled steroids may result in lower bone mineral density.[233]
 Inflammation in the lungs can be estimated by the level of exhaled nitric oxide.[234][235] The use of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO) to guide asthma medication dosing may have small benefits for preventing asthma attacks but the potential benefits are not strong enough for this approach to be universally recommended as a method to guide asthma therapy in adults or children.[234][235]
 When asthma is unresponsive to usual medications, other options are available for both emergency management and prevention of flareups. Additional options include:
 Staying with a treatment approach for preventing asthma exacerbations can be challenging, especially if the person is required to take medicine or treatments daily.[256] Reasons for low adherence range from a conscious decision to not follow the suggested medical treatment regime for various reasons including avoiding potential side effects, misinformation, or other beliefs about the medication.[256] Problems accessing the treatment and problems administering the treatment effectively can also result in lower adherence. Various approaches have been undertaken to try and improve adherence to treatments to help people prevent serious asthma exacerbations including digital interventions.[256]
 Many people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy.[257][258] There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies.
 Evidence is insufficient to support the usage of vitamin C or vitamin E for controlling asthma.[259][260] There is tentative support for use of vitamin C in exercise induced bronchospasm.[261] Fish oil dietary supplements (marine n-3 fatty acids)[262] and reducing dietary sodium[263] do not appear to help improve asthma control. In people with mild to moderate asthma, treatment with vitamin D supplementation or its hydroxylated metabolites does not reduce acute exacerbations or improve control.[264] There is no strong evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplements improve day-to-day asthma symptoms or a person's lung function.[264] There is no strong evidence to suggest that adults with asthma should avoid foods that contain monosodium glutamate (MSG).[265] There have not been enough high-quality studies performed to determine if children with asthma should avoid eating food that contains MSG.[265]
 Acupuncture is not recommended for the treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use.[266][267] Air ionisers show no evidence that they improve asthma symptoms or benefit lung function; this applied equally to positive and negative ion generators.[268] Manual therapies, including osteopathic, chiropractic, physiotherapeutic and respiratory therapeutic maneuvers, have insufficient evidence to support their use in treating asthma.[269]  Pulmonary rehabilitation, however, may improve quality of life and functional exercise capacity when compared to usual care for adults with asthma.[270] The Buteyko breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use; however, the technique does not have any effect on lung function.[157]  Thus an expert panel felt that evidence was insufficient to support its use.[266] There is no clear evidence that breathing exercises are effective for treating children with asthma.[271]
 The prognosis for asthma is generally good, especially for children with mild disease.[272] Mortality has decreased over the last few decades due to better recognition and improvement in care.[273] In 2010 the death rate was 170 per million for males and 90 per million for females.[274] Rates vary between countries by 100-fold.[274]
 Globally it causes moderate or severe disability in 19.4 million people as of 2004[update] (16 million of which are in low and middle income countries).[275] Of asthma diagnosed during childhood, half of cases will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade.[76] Airway remodeling is observed, but it is unknown whether these represent harmful or beneficial changes.[276] More recent data find that severe asthma can result in airway remodeling and the ""asthma with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease syndrome (ACOS)"" that has a poor prognosis.[277]  Early treatment with corticosteroids seems to prevent or ameliorates a decline in lung function.[278] Asthma in children also has negative effects on quality of life of their parents.[279]
 In 2019, approximately 262 million people worldwide were affected by asthma and approximately 461,000 people died from the disease.[8] Rates vary between countries with prevalences between 1 and 18%.[21] It is more common in developed than developing countries.[21] One thus sees lower rates in Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.[20] Within developed countries it is more common in those who are economically disadvantaged while in contrast in developing countries it is more common in the affluent.[21] The reason for these differences is not well known.[21] Low- and middle-income countries make up more than 80% of the mortality.[282]
 While asthma is twice as common in boys as girls,[21] severe asthma occurs at equal rates.[283] In contrast adult women have a higher rate of asthma than men[21] and it is more common in the young than the old.[20] In 2010, children with asthma experienced over 900,000 emergency department visits, making it the most common reason for admission to the hospital following an emergency department visit in the US in 2011.[284][285]
 Global rates of asthma have increased significantly between the 1960s and 2008[18][286] with it being recognized as a major public health problem since the 1970s.[20] Rates of asthma have plateaued in the developed world since the mid-1990s with recent increases primarily in the developing world.[287] Asthma affects approximately 7% of the population of the United States[203] and 5% of people in the United Kingdom.[288] Canada, Australia and New Zealand have rates of about 14–15%.[289]
 The average death rate from 2011 to 2015 from asthma in the UK was about 50% higher than the average for the European Union and had increased by about 5% in that time.[290] Children are more likely see a physician due to asthma symptoms after school starts in September.[291]
 Population-based epidemiological studies describe temporal associations between acute respiratory illnesses, asthma, and development of severe asthma with irreversible airflow limitation (known as the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ""overlap"" syndrome, or ACOS).[292][293][31] Additional prospective population-based data indicate that ACOS seems to represent a form of severe asthma, characterised by more frequent hospitalisations, and to be the result of early-onset asthma that has progressed to fixed airflow obstruction.[32]
 From 2000 to 2010, the average cost per asthma-related hospital stay in the United States for children remained relatively stable at about $3,600, whereas the average cost per asthma-related hospital stay for adults increased from $5,200 to $6,600.[294] In 2010, Medicaid was the most frequent primary payer among children and adults aged 18–44 years in the United States; private insurance was the second most frequent payer.[294] Among both children and adults in the lowest income communities in the United States there is a higher rate of hospital stays for asthma in 2010 than those in the highest income communities.[294]
 Asthma was recognized in ancient Egypt and was treated by drinking an incense mixture known as kyphi.[19] It was officially named as a specific respiratory problem by Hippocrates circa 450 BC, with the Greek word for ""panting"" forming the basis of our modern name.[20] In 200 BC it was believed to be at least partly related to the emotions.[28] In the 12th century the Jewish physician-philosopher Maimonides wrote a treatise on asthma in Arabic, based partly on Arabic sources, in which he discussed the symptoms, proposed various dietary and other means of treatment, and emphasized the importance of climate and clean air.[295] Traditional Chinese medicine also offered medication for asthma, as indicated by a surviving 14th-century manuscript curated by the Wellcome Foundation.[296]
 In 1873, one of the first papers in modern medicine on the subject tried to explain the pathophysiology of the disease while one in 1872, concluded that asthma can be cured by rubbing the chest with chloroform liniment.[297][298] Medical treatment in 1880 included the use of intravenous doses of a drug called pilocarpine.[299]
 In 1886, F. H. Bosworth theorized a connection between asthma and hay fever.[300]
 At the beginning of the 20th century, the focus was the avoidance of allergens as well as selective beta-2 adrenoceptor agonists were used as treatment strategies.[301][302]
 Epinephrine was first referred to in the treatment of asthma in 1905.[303] Oral corticosteroids began to be used for the condition in 1950. The use of a pressurized metered-dose inhaler was developed in the mid-1950s for the administration of adrenaline and isoproterenol and was later used as a beta2-adrenergic agonist.
 Inhaled corticosteroids and selective short-acting beta agonists came into wide use in the 1960s.[304][305]
 A well-documented case in the 19th century was that of young Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919). At that time there was no effective treatment. Roosevelt's youth was in large part shaped by his poor health partly related to his asthma. He experienced recurring nighttime asthma attacks that felt as if he was being smothered to death, terrifying the boy and his parents.[306]
 During the 1930s to 1950s, asthma was known as one of the ""holy seven"" psychosomatic illnesses. Its cause was considered to be psychological, with treatment often based on psychoanalysis and other talking cures.[307] As these psychoanalysts interpreted the asthmatic wheeze as the suppressed cry of the child for its mother, they considered the treatment of depression to be especially important for individuals with asthma.[307]
 In January 2021, an appeal court in France overturned a deportation order against a 40-year-old Bangladeshi man, who was a patient of asthma. His lawyers had argued that the dangerous levels of pollution in Bangladesh could possibly lead to worsening of his health condition, or even premature death.[308]

"Bronchial asthma (or asthma) is a lung disease. Your airways get narrow and swollen and are blocked by excess mucus. Medications can treat these symptoms. Asthma, also called bronchial asthma, is a disease that affects your lungs. It’s a chronic (ongoing) condition, meaning it doesn’t go away and needs ongoing medical management. Asthma affects more than 25 million people in the U.S. currently. This total includes more than 5 million children. Asthma can be life-threatening if you don’t get treatment. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy When you breathe normally, muscles around your airways are relaxed, letting air move easily and quietly. During an asthma attack, three things can happen: When your airways get tighter, you make a sound called wheezing when you breathe, a noise your airways make when you breathe out. You might also hear an asthma attack called an exacerbation or a flare-up. It’s the term for when your asthma isn’t controlled. Asthma is broken down into types based on the cause and the severity of symptoms. Healthcare providers identify asthma as: Asthma has multiple causes: Asthma can also be: In addition, there are these types of asthma: Advertisement Anyone can develop asthma at any age. People with allergies or people exposed to tobacco smoke are more likely to develop asthma. This includes secondhand smoke (exposure to someone else who is smoking) and thirdhand smoke (exposure to clothing or surfaces in places where some has smoked). Statistics show that people assigned female at birth tend to have asthma more than people assigned male at birth. Asthma affects Black people more frequently than other races. Researchers don’t know why some people have asthma while others don’t. But certain factors present a higher risk: Advertisement You can have an asthma attack if you come in contact with substances that irritate you. Healthcare providers call these substances “triggers.” Knowing what triggers your asthma makes it easier to avoid asthma attacks. For some people, a trigger can bring on an attack right away. For other people, or at other times, an attack may start hours or days later. Triggers can be different for each person. But some common triggers include: People with asthma usually have obvious symptoms. These signs and symptoms resemble many respiratory infections: With asthma, you may not have all of these symptoms with every flare. You can have different symptoms and signs at different times with chronic asthma. Also, symptoms can change between asthma attacks. Your healthcare provider will review your medical history, including information about your parents and siblings. Your provider will also ask you about your symptoms. Your provider will need to know any history of allergies, eczema (a bumpy rash caused by allergies) and other lung diseases. Your provider may order spirometry. This test measures airflow through your lungs and is used to diagnose and monitor your progress with treatment. Your healthcare provider may order a chest X-ray, blood test or skin test. You have options to help manage your asthma. Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to control symptoms. These include: You can take asthma medicines in several different ways. You may breathe in the medicines using a metered-dose inhaler, nebulizer or another type of asthma inhaler. Your healthcare provider may prescribe oral medications that you swallow. The goal of asthma treatment is to control symptoms. Asthma control means you: You should keep track of your asthma symptom. It’s an important piece of managing the disease. Your healthcare provider may ask to use a peak flow (PF) meter. This device measures how fast you can blow air out of your lungs. It can help your provider make adjustments to your medication. It also tells you if your symptoms are getting worse. If your healthcare provider says you have asthma, you’ll need to figure out what triggers an attack. Avoiding the triggers can help you avoid an attack. You can’t prevent yourself from getting asthma, though. If you have asthma, you can still live a very productive life and participate in sports and other activities. Your healthcare provider can help you manage symptoms, learn your triggers and prevent or manage attacks. Your healthcare provider will work with you to develop an asthma action plan. This plan tells you how and when to use your medicines. It also tells you what to do based on your asthma symptoms and when to seek emergency care. Ask your healthcare provider about anything you don’t understand. If you have a severe asthma attack, you need to get immediate medical care. The first thing you should do is use your rescue inhaler. A rescue inhaler uses fast-acting medicines to open up your airways. It’s different than a maintenance inhaler, which you use every day. You should use the rescue inhaler when symptoms are bothering you and you can use it more frequently if your flare is severe. If your rescue inhaler doesn’t help or you don’t have it with you, go to the emergency department if you have: You’ll need to see a healthcare provider to find out if you have asthma or some other condition. There are other respiratory diseases that make it hard to breathe or cause coughing and wheezing. No. Asthma can’t be cured, but it can be managed. Children may outgrow asthma as they get older. Asthma that gets worse at night is sometimes called nighttime asthma or nocturnal asthma. There are no definite reasons that this happens, but there are some educated guesses. These include: If you have asthma that is moderate-to-severe, or if your asthma symptoms aren’t well controlled, you’re at greater risk of having to be hospitalized if you get COVID-19. Therefore, you should wear a mask if you go to indoor spaces with other people, get vaccinated and avoid exposure to people who have the virus. A note from Cleveland Clinic Many people live fulfilling lives with asthma. Some professional athletes with asthma have set records in their sports. Your healthcare provider can help you find the best way to manage your asthma. Talk to your healthcare provider about how to control your symptoms. Last reviewed on 01/19/2022.

"When a person has asthma, the inside walls of the airways in the lungs can narrow and swell. Also, the airway linings may make too much mucus. The result is an asthma attack. During an asthma attack, narrowed airways make breathing difficult and may cause coughing and wheezing. When a person has asthma, the inside walls of the airways in the lungs can narrow and swell. Also, the airway linings may make too much mucus. The result is an asthma attack. During an asthma attack, narrowed airways make breathing difficult and may cause coughing and wheezing. Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust your treatment as needed. Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. You may have infrequent asthma attacks, have symptoms only at certain times — such as when exercising — or have symptoms all the time. Asthma signs and symptoms include: Signs that your asthma is probably worsening include: For some people, asthma signs and symptoms flare up in certain situations: Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening. Work with your doctor to determine what to do when your signs and symptoms worsen — and when you need emergency treatment. Signs of an asthma emergency include: See your doctor: If your asthma symptoms get worse. Contact your doctor right away if your medication doesn't seem to ease your symptoms or if you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often. Don't take more medication than prescribed without consulting your doctor first. Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your asthma worse. There is a problem with

Exposure to various irritants and substances that trigger allergies (allergens) can trigger signs and symptoms of asthma. Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include: A number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. They include: Asthma complications include: Proper treatment makes a big difference in preventing both short-term and long-term complications caused by asthma. While there's no way to prevent asthma, you and your doctor can design a step-by-step plan for living with your condition and preventing asthma attacks. Follow your asthma action plan. With your doctor and health care team, write a detailed plan for taking medications and managing an asthma attack. Then be sure to follow your plan. Asthma is an ongoing condition that needs regular monitoring and treatment. Taking control of your treatment can make you feel more in control of your life. Monitor your breathing. You may learn to recognize warning signs of an impending attack, such as slight coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath. But because your lung function may decrease before you notice any signs or symptoms, regularly measure and record your peak airflow with a home peak flow meter. A peak flow meter measures how hard you can breathe out. Your doctor can show you how to monitor your peak flow at home. Identify and treat attacks early. If you act quickly, you're less likely to have a severe attack. You also won't need as much medication to control your symptoms. When your peak flow measurements decrease and alert you to an oncoming attack, take your medication as instructed. Also, immediately stop any activity that may have triggered the attack. If your symptoms don't improve, get medical help as directed in your action plan.

"Asthma occurs because of inflammation and mucus in the lining of your airways. During an attack, this inflammation causes a wheezing or whistling sound when you breathe, along with other symptoms. Asthma is an inflammatory disease that can affect the airways to your lungs. It makes breathing difficult and can make some physical activities challenging or even impossible. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 25 million people in the United States have asthma. It’s the most common chronic lung condition among children in the United States: In 2018, the CDC reported that about 1 of every 12 children had asthma. To understand asthma, it’s necessary to know a little about what happens when you breathe. Usually, with every breath you take, air goes through your nose or mouth, down into your throat, and into your airways, eventually reaching your lungs.  There are lots of small air passages in your lungs that help deliver oxygen from the air to your bloodstream. Asthma symptoms happen when the lining of your airways swells and the muscles around them tighten. Mucus then fills your airways, further reducing the amount of air that can pass through. These effects can bring on an asthma “attack,” which involves the coughing and chest tightness that are typical of asthma. The most common symptom of asthma is wheezing — a squealing or whistling sound that happens when you breathe.  Other possible asthma symptoms include: The type of asthma you have can determine which symptoms you experience. Some people experience symptoms consistently throughout the day. Others may find that certain activities make their symptoms worse. But not everyone with asthma will experience these particular symptoms. If you think the symptoms you’re experiencing could be related to a condition such as asthma, make an appointment to see a healthcare professional. If you have asthma, remember that even if your condition is well managed, you may occasionally have a flare-up of symptoms. Flare-ups often decrease with the use of quick-acting treatments, such as inhalers, but may require medical attention in severe cases. Symptoms of an asthma flare-up may include: If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve with the use of an inhaler, you should seek immediate medical treatment. You should also seek treatment if you have symptoms of an asthma emergency, such as: If you or someone around you is experiencing symptoms of an asthma emergency, call 911 or your local emergency number or go to the nearest emergency department. Although asthma is especially common in children, many people don’t develop asthma until adulthood. Health experts have not identified a specific cause of asthma. Instead, researchers believe it’s caused by a variety of factors, including: Many factors can also trigger asthma, causing the symptoms to worsen. Triggers for asthma can vary, and some people may be more sensitive to certain triggers than others. The most common triggers include: Your doctor will need to determine the type of asthma you have. The most common type is allergic asthma, which accounts for 60% of all cases of asthma. Some types of asthma are related to your stage of life. While asthma can appear at any age, pediatric asthma specifically affects children, and adult-onset asthma doesn’t begin until adulthood. The sections below describe other specific types of asthma. This common type of asthma is triggered by allergens, including: Allergic asthma is often seasonal because it goes hand-in-hand with seasonal allergies. Irritants in the air that are not related to allergies trigger this type of asthma. These irritants might include: Occupational asthma is triggered by irritants in the workplace, such as: These irritants can exist in a wide range of industries, including: EIB usually affects people within a few minutes of starting exercise and can last until 10–15 minutes after physical activity.  This condition was previously called exercise-induced asthma. Up to 90% of people with asthma also experience EIB, but not everyone with EIB will have other types of asthma. Aspirin-induced asthma (AIA), or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, is usually severe.  It’s triggered by taking aspirin or another NSAID, such as naproxen (Aleve) or ibuprofen (Advil).  The symptoms may begin within minutes or hours. People with AIA also typically have nasal polyps. About 9% of people with asthma have AIA. It usually develops suddenly in adults ages 20–50 years. In this type of asthma, symptoms worsen at night. Triggers that might bring on symptoms at night include: Your body’s natural sleep cycle may also trigger nocturnal asthma. CVA doesn’t cause the classic asthma symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath. Instead, it involves a persistent dry cough. However, if it’s not treated, CVA can lead to full-blown asthma flares that include the more common symptoms.  No single test or exam can determine whether you or your child has asthma. Instead, healthcare professionals will use a variety of criteria to find out whether your symptoms are the result of asthma. The following steps can help healthcare professionals diagnose asthma: Doctors don’t typically perform breathing tests in children under 5 years of age because it’s difficult to get an accurate reading.  Instead, they may prescribe asthma medications to your child and wait to see whether their symptoms improve. If your child’s symptoms improve with medication, your child likely has asthma. Your doctor may prescribe a bronchodilator or another asthma medication if your test results indicate asthma. If your symptoms improve with the use of this medication, your doctor will continue to treat your condition as asthma. To help treat asthma, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) classifies the condition based on its severity before treatment.  Asthma classifications include: Treatments for asthma fall into four primary categories:  Your doctor will recommend one treatment or a combination of treatments based on: Your treatment plan may also involve learning your triggers, carefully monitoring your symptoms, and taking steps to avoid flare-ups. These medications should be used only in the event of asthma symptoms or an attack. They provide quick relief to help you breathe again.  Bronchodilators work within minutes to relax the tightened muscles around your airways and quickly decrease your symptoms. Although they can come in the form of an oral medication or injection, bronchodilators are most commonly taken with an inhaler (rescue) or nebulizer. Your doctor may recommend that you use them to treat sudden asthma symptoms or take them before exercise to prevent a flare-up. If you think someone you know is having an asthma attack, tell them to sit them upright and help them use their rescue inhaler or nebulizer.  The dosage will depend on the medication. Check the instructions insert to make sure you know how many puffs of medications you need in the event of an attack. If symptoms persist for more than 20 minutes and a second round of medication doesn’t help, seek emergency medical attention. If you need to use quick-relief medications frequently, ask your doctor about another type of medication for long-term asthma control.  You can take these medications daily to help reduce the number and severity of asthma symptoms. But they don’t manage the immediate symptoms of an attack. Long-term asthma control medications include: Doctors use biologics to treat severe asthma that doesn’t respond to other medications or to treatment by trigger management.  They work by targeting specific antibodies in your body, disrupting the pathway that leads to asthma-causing inflammation. There are five types of biologic medications on the market, and others are in development. You can receive this type of medication either as an injection or as an infusion in your doctor’s office. This treatment uses an electrode to heat the airways inside your lungs, helping to reduce the size of the surrounding muscle and prevent it from tightening.  A doctor will perform this minimally invasive procedure in a clinic or hospital. It usually takes about an hour. Bronchial thermoplasty is intended for people with severe asthma and can provide relief from symptoms for up to 5 years. However, because it’s a relatively new procedure, it’s not yet widely available. When your asthma symptoms get progressively worse, it’s known as an exacerbation, or an asthma attack.  Breathing becomes increasingly difficult because your airways are swollen and your bronchial tubes have narrowed. The symptoms of an exacerbation may include: Although an exacerbation can end quickly without medication, you should contact your doctor when you experience one, because it can be life threatening.  The longer an exacerbation lasts, the more it can affect your ability to breathe. That’s why exacerbations often require a trip to the emergency room.  You can help prevent exacerbations by taking medications that help manage your asthma symptoms.  Because researchers have not yet found the exact cause, it’s challenging to know how to prevent asthma. But some strategies can help prevent asthma attacks, including: Your doctor can help you create an asthma action plan so you know which treatments to use and when. In addition to using maintenance medications, you can take steps each day to improve your overall health and reduce your risk for asthma attacks. These include: At the moment, there’s no cure for asthma. But there are many effective treatments that can decrease the symptoms. Lifestyle strategies and medications can also help improve your quality of life. If you haven’t received an asthma diagnosis but you’re experiencing symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, it’s a good idea to make an appointment with a healthcare professional. You can find one in your area using the Healthline FindCare tool. If you receive a diagnosis of asthma, you should see your doctor at least once per year. If you have persistent symptoms even after trying some treatments, you may need to see your doctor more often.  Call your doctor immediately if you: It’s important to learn about your condition and its symptoms. The more you know, the more proactive you can be in improving your lung function and how you feel.  Talk with your doctor about: Most inhalers are safe to use for up to 1 year after their expiration date. However, the medication will gradually lose its potency over time, and the manufacturer can no longer guarantee its effectiveness. While asthma attacks can be mild and short, a severe asthma attack is a serious medical condition and has the potential to be fatal. Seek medical attention if you or someone else experiences the following symptoms: An anxiety attack and an asthma attack can sometimes feel very similar, as both can involve shortness of breath, insomnia, and fatigue. Watch for wheezing and coughing, which are clear symptoms of asthma. Choking sensations and muscle tension are more common in an anxiety attack.  Asthma is a condition that inflames your lungs and makes breathing difficult. It can affect both adults and children and has multiple forms and varying levels of severity.  There are some medications available to treat asthma. The most common treatments are bronchodilators, which can be used in the short term to treat an asthma attack or in the long term to manage symptoms over time. Lifestyle strategies such as dietary changes, exercise, and stress management may also help reduce asthma flare-ups. A doctor can identify the type of asthma you have and help you find the best treatment and management options. Read this article in Spanish.

 Asthma is a common lung condition that causes occasional breathing difficulties. It affects people of all ages and often starts in childhood, although it can also develop for the first time in adults. There's currently no cure, but there are simple treatments that can help keep the symptoms under control so it does not have a big impact on your life. The main symptoms of asthma are: The symptoms can sometimes get temporarily worse. This is known as an asthma attack. See a GP if you think you or your child may have asthma. Several conditions can cause similar symptoms, so it's important to get a proper diagnosis and correct treatment. The GP will usually be able to diagnose asthma by asking about symptoms and carrying out some simple tests. Find out more about how asthma is diagnosed. Asthma is usually treated by using an inhaler, a small device that lets you breathe in medicines. The main types are: Some people also need to take tablets. Asthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) of the breathing tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. This makes the tubes highly sensitive, so they temporarily narrow. It may happen randomly or after exposure to a trigger. Common asthma triggers include: Identifying and avoiding your asthma triggers can help you keep your symptoms under control. Asthma is a long-term condition for many people, particularly if it first develops when you're an adult. In children, it sometimes goes away or improves during the teenage years, but can come back later in life. The symptoms can usually be controlled with treatment. Most people will have normal, active lives, although some people with more severe asthma may have ongoing problems. Although asthma can normally be kept under control, it's still a serious condition that can cause a number of problems. This is why it's important to follow your treatment plan and not ignore your symptoms if they're getting worse. Badly controlled asthma can cause problems such as: There's also a risk of severe asthma attacks, which can be life threatening.

"Autoimmune diseases are conditions in which your immune system mistakenly damages healthy cells in your body. Types include rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and some thyroid conditions. Your immune system usually protects you from diseases and infections. When it senses these pathogens, it creates specific cells to target foreign cells. Usually, your immune system can tell the difference between foreign cells and your cells. But if you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system mistakes parts of your body, such as your joints or skin, as foreign. It releases proteins called autoantibodies that attack healthy cells. Some autoimmune diseases target only one organ. Type 1 diabetes damages your pancreas. Other conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, can affect your whole body. Below we provide an overview of some of the most common autoimmune diseases. Doctors don’t know exactly what causes the immune system to misfire. Yet some people are more likely to get an autoimmune disease than others.  Some factors that may increase your risk of developing an autoimmune disease can include: Different autoimmune diseases may have similar early symptoms. These can include: With some autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), symptoms may come and go. A period of symptoms is called a flare up. A period when the symptoms go away is called remission. Individual autoimmune diseases can also have their own unique symptoms depending on the body systems affected. For example, with type 1 diabetes, you may experience extreme thirst and weight loss. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause bloating and diarrhea. Researchers have identified more than 100 autoimmune diseases. Here are 14 more common ones. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar levels. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys insulin-producing cells in your pancreas. High blood sugar from type 1 diabetes can damage the blood vessels and organs. This can include your: In RA, your immune system attacks the joints. This causes symptoms affecting the joints such as: While RA more commonly affects people as they get older, it can also start as early as your 30s. A related condition, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, can start in childhood. Skin cells grow and then shed when they’re no longer needed. Psoriasis causes skin cells to multiply too quickly. The extra cells build up and form inflamed patches. On lighter skin tones, patches may appear red with silver-white scales of plaque. On darker skin tones, psoriasis may appear purplish or dark brown with gray scales.  Up to 30% of people with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis. This can cause joint symptoms that include:  Multiple sclerosis (MS) damages the protective coating surrounding nerve cells (myelin sheath) in your central nervous system. Damage to the myelin sheath slows the transmission speed of messages between your brain and spinal cord to and from the rest of your body. This damage can lead to: Different forms of MS progress at different rates. Difficulties with walking are one of the most common mobility issues with MS. Although doctors in the 1800s first described lupus as a skin disease because of the rash it commonly produces, the systemic form, which is most common, actually affects many organs. This can include your: Common symptoms can include: IBD describes conditions that cause inflammation in the lining of the intestinal wall. Each type of IBD affects a different part of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Common symptoms of IBD can include: Addison’s disease affects the adrenal glands, which produce the hormones cortisol and aldosterone as well as androgen hormones. Too little cortisol can affect how your body uses and stores carbohydrates and sugar (glucose). Too little aldosterone can lead to sodium loss and excess potassium in your bloodstream. Common symptoms of Addison’s disease can include: Graves’ disease attacks the thyroid gland in your neck, causing it to produce too much of its hormones. Thyroid hormones control the body’s energy usage, known as metabolism. Having too much of these hormones revs up your body’s activities, causing symptoms that may include: Some people with Graves’ disease may also experience symptoms affecting the skin (Graves’ dermopathy) or eyes (Graves’ ophthalmopathy). This condition attacks the glands that provide lubrication to your eyes and mouth. The hallmark symptoms of Sjögren’s disease are dry eyes and dry mouth, but it may also affect your joints or skin. In Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, thyroid hormone production slows to a deficiency. Common symptoms of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis can include: Myasthenia gravis affects nerve impulses that help the brain control muscles. When the communication from nerves to muscles is impaired, signals can’t direct the muscles to contract. The most common symptom is muscle weakness. It may worsen with activity and improve with rest. Muscle weakness can also affect: People with celiac disease can’t eat foods containing gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and other grain products. When gluten is in the small intestine, the immune system attacks this part of the GI tract and causes inflammation. People with celiac disease may experience digestive issues after consuming gluten. Symptoms can include: According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, celiac disease affects about 1% of people in the world. Autoimmune vasculitis happens when your immune system attacks blood vessels. The inflammation that results narrows your arteries and veins, allowing less blood to flow through them. Pernicious anemia may happen when an autoimmune disorder causes your body to not produce enough of a substance called intrinsic factor. Having a deficiency in this substance reduces the amount of vitamin B12 your small intestine absorbs from food. It can cause a low red blood cell count. Without enough of this vitamin, you’ll develop anemia, and your body’s ability for proper DNA synthesis will be altered. It can cause symptoms that include: This rare autoimmune disease typically occurs in people ages 60 to 70 and older. Generally speaking, autoimmune disorders cannot be cured. They can, however, be controlled with medications and other treatments. Researchers are continuing to look for a cure, so the answer to this question may change in the coming years.  There are over 80 different types of autoimmune disorders and most are not fatal. People can expect to live full lives with no shortening of typical life expectancy. Some autoimmune disorders can have similar symptoms at early stages. These can include fatigue, dizziness or lightheadedness, low grade fever, muscle aches, and swelling. Many researchers recognize giant cell myocarditis, a rare autoimmune condition that can lead to heart failure, as one of the most serious autoimmune diseases. It has a 1-year mortality rate of 70%. The most common autoimmune diseases are psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, connective tissue diseases, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroid diseases such as Hashimoto’s, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. The symptoms of autoimmune diseases often overlap, complicating diagnoses. Blood tests that look for autoantibodies can help doctors diagnose these conditions.

But if the immune system malfunctions, it mistakenly attacks healthy cells, tissues, and organs. Called autoimmune disease, these attacks can affect any part of the body, weakening bodily function and even turning life-threatening. Scientists know about more than 80 autoimmune diseases. Some are well known, such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis, while others are rare and difficult to diagnose. With unusual autoimmune diseases, patients may suffer years before getting a proper diagnosis. Most of these diseases have no cure. Some require lifelong treatment to ease symptoms.   To volunteer for a study seeking causes of and possible treatments for autoimmune diseases, visit this clinical trials website, and you may find one that addresses your condition. Autoimmune diseases are affecting more people. As many as 50 million people in the U.S. have an autoimmune disease, making it the third most prevalent disease category, surpassed only by cancer and heart disease. A person’s genes in combination with infections and other environmental exposures likely play a significant role in disease development.  Nearly 80% of people with a chronic autoimmune condition are women. These autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, scleroderma, lupus, Sjögren’s syndrome, and others. Researchers are conducting studies to understand why there is a sex-biased trend in this disease category. Studies indicate these diseases likely result from interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Gender, race, and ethnicity characteristics are linked to a likelihood of developing an autoimmune disease.1
 Autoimmune diseases are more common when people are in contact with certain environmental exposures, as described below. Unraveling the genetic and environmental underpinnings of autoimmune disease is a focus at NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program (NTP). Progress happens through multiple research efforts, such as: This content is available to use on your website."
"An autoimmune disease is a condition that results from an anomalous response of the adaptive immune system, wherein it mistakenly targets and attacks healthy, functioning parts of the body as if they were foreign organisms.[1] It is estimated that there are more than 80 recognized autoimmune diseases, with recent scientific evidence suggesting the existence of potentially more than 100 distinct conditions.[4][5][6] Nearly any body part can be involved.[7]
 Autoimmune diseases are a separate class from autoinflammatory diseases. Both are characterized by an immune system malfunction which may cause similar symptoms, such as rash, swelling, or fatigue, but the cardinal cause or mechanism of the diseases are different. A key difference is a malfunction of the innate immune system in autoinflammatory diseases, whereas in autoimmune diseases there is a malfunction of the adaptive immune system.[8]
 Symptoms of autoimmune diseases can significantly vary, primarily based on the specific type of the disease and the body part that it affects. Symptoms are often diverse and can be fleeting, fluctuating from mild to severe, and typically comprise low-grade fever, fatigue, and general malaise.[1] However, some autoimmune diseases may present with more specific symptoms such as joint pain, skin rashes (e.g., urticaria), or neurological symptoms.
 The exact causes of autoimmune diseases remain unclear and are likely multifactorial, involving both genetic and environmental influences.[7]  While some diseases like lupus exhibit familial aggregation, suggesting a genetic predisposition, other cases have been associated with infectious triggers or exposure to environmental factors, implying a complex interplay between genes and environment in their etiology.
 Some of the most common diseases that are generally categorized as autoimmune include celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, Graves' disease, inflammatory bowel diseases (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), multiple sclerosis, alopecia areata,[9] Addison's disease, pernicious anemia, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Diagnosing autoimmune diseases can be challenging due to their diverse presentations and the transient nature of many symptoms.[1]
 Treatment modalities for autoimmune diseases vary based on the type of disease and its severity.[1]  Therapeutic approaches primarily aim to manage symptoms, reduce immune system activity, and maintain the body's ability to fight diseases. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and immunosuppressants are commonly used to reduce inflammation and control the overactive immune response. In certain cases, intravenous immunoglobulin may be administered to regulate the immune system.[2] Despite these treatments often leading to symptom improvement, they usually do not offer a cure and long-term management is often required.[1]
 In terms of prevalence, a UK study found that 10% of the population were affected by an autoimmune disease.[3] Women are more commonly affected than men. Autoimmune diseases predominantly begin in adulthood, although they can start at any age.[1] The initial recognition of autoimmune diseases dates back to the early 1900s, and since then, advancements in understanding and management of these conditions have been substantial, though much more is needed to fully unravel their complex etiology and pathophysiology.[10]
 Autoimmune diseases represent a vast and diverse category of disorders that, despite their differences, share some common symptomatic threads.[1] These shared symptoms occur as a result of the body's immune system mistakenly attacking its own cells and tissues, causing inflammation and damage. However, due to the broad range of autoimmune diseases, the specific presentation of symptoms can significantly vary based on the type of disease, the organ systems affected, and individual factors such as age, sex, hormonal status, and environmental influences.[1]
 An individual may simultaneously have more than one autoimmune disease (known as polyautoimmunity), further complicating the symptomatology.[1]
 Symptoms that are commonly associated with autoimmune diseases include:[11]
 Specific autoimmune diseases have a wide range of other symptoms, with examples including dry mouth, dry eyes, tingling and numbness in parts of the body, unexpected weight loss or gain, and diarrhoea.
 These symptoms often reflect the body's systemic inflammatory response. However, their occurrence and intensity can fluctuate over time, leading to periods of heightened disease activity, referred to as flare-ups, and periods of relative inactivity, known as remissions.
 The specific presentation of symptoms largely depends on the location and type of autoimmune response. For instance, in rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease primarily affecting the joints, symptoms typically include joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. On the other hand, type 1 diabetes, which results from an autoimmune attack on the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, primarily presents with symptoms related to high blood sugar, such as increased thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss.
 Commonly affected areas in autoimmune diseases include blood vessels, connective tissues, joints, muscles, red blood cells, skin, and endocrine glands such as the thyroid gland (in diseases like Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease) and the pancreas (in type 1 diabetes). The impacts of these diseases can range from localized damage to certain tissues, alteration in organ growth and function, to more systemic effects when multiple tissues throughout the body are affected.[14]
 The appearance of these signs and symptoms can not only provide clues for the diagnosis of an autoimmune condition, often in conjunction with tests for specific biological markers, but also help monitor disease progression and response to treatment.[15] Ultimately, due to the diverse nature of autoimmune diseases, a multidimensional approach is often needed for the management of these conditions, taking into consideration the variety of symptoms and their impacts on individuals' lives.
 While it is estimated that over 80 recognized types of autoimmune diseases exist, this section provides an overview of some of the most common and well-studied forms.[1][16][17]
 Coeliac disease is an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.[18]  For those with the disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response in the small intestine, leading to damage on the villi, small fingerlike projections that line the small intestine and promote nutrient absorption.[18] This explains the increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers, as the gastrointestinal tract includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus, all areas that the ingested gluten would traverse in digestion.[18] The incidence of gastrointestinal cancer can be partially reduced or eliminated if a patient removes gluten from their diet.[18][19][20][21][22] Additionally, coeliac disease is correlated with lymphoproliferative disorders.[18]
 Graves' disease is a condition characterized by development of autoantibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors (TRAb). The binding of TRAb autoantibodies to TSH receptor results in unregulated production and release of thyroid hormone,[23] which can lead to stimulatory effects such as rapid heart rate, weight loss, nervousness, and irritability. Other symptoms more specific to Graves' disease include bulging eyes and swelling of the lower legs.
 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) encompasses conditions characterized by chronic inflammation of the digestive tract, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In both cases, individuals with IBD lose immune tolerance for normal bacteria present in the gut microbiome.[18] Symptoms include severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss. IBD is associated with cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and some lymphoproliferative cancers.[18]
 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease in which the immune system attacks myelin, a protective covering of nerve fibers in the central nervous system, causing communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body. Symptoms can include fatigue, difficulty walking, numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, and problems with coordination and balance.[24] MS is associated with an increased risk of central nervous system cancer, primarily in the brain.[18]
 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) primarily targets the joints, causing persistent inflammation that results in joint damage and pain. It is often symmetrical, meaning that if one hand or knee has it, the other one does too. RA can also affect the heart, lungs, and eyes. Additionally, the chronic inflammation and over-activation of the immune system creates an environment that favors further malignant transformation of other cells, perhaps explaining the associations with cancer of the lungs and skin as well as the increased risk of other hematologic cancers, none of which are directly affected by the inflammation of joints.[25][26]
 Psoriasis is a skin condition characterized by the rapid buildup of skin cells, leading to scaling on the skin's surface. Inflammation and redness around the scales is common.[27] Some individuals with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis, which causes joint pain, stiffness, and swelling.[28]
 Sjögren syndrome (SjS, SS) is a long-term autoimmune disease that affects the body's moisture-producing glands (lacrimal and salivary),[29] and often seriously affects other organ systems, such as the lungs, kidneys, and nervous system.
 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), referred to simply as lupus, is a systemic autoimmune disease that affects multiple organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and the nervous system. It is characterized by a widespread loss of immune tolerance.[30] The disease is characterized by periods of flares and remissions, and symptoms range from mild to severe. Women, especially those of childbearing age, are disproportionately affected.[31]
 Type 1 diabetes is a condition resulting from the immune system attacking insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to high blood sugar levels. Symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss. It is most commonly diagnosed in children and young adults.[32]
 Undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) occurs when people have features of connective tissue disease, such as blood test results and external characteristics, but do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria established for any one connective tissue disease. Some 30–40% transition to a specific connective tissue disease over time.
 The exact causes of autoimmune diseases remain largely unknown;[7] however, research has suggested that a combination of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors, as well as certain infections, may contribute to the development of these disorders.[1]
 The human immune system is equipped with several mechanisms to maintain a delicate balance between defending against foreign invaders and protecting its own cells. To achieve this, it generates both T cells and B cells, which are capable of reacting with self-proteins. However, in a healthy immune response, self-reactive cells are generally either eliminated before they become active, rendered inert via a process called anergy, or their activities are suppressed by regulatory cells.
 A familial tendency to develop autoimmune diseases suggests a genetic component. Some conditions, like lupus and multiple sclerosis, often occur in several members of the same family, indicating a potential hereditary link. Additionally, certain genes have been identified that increase the risk of developing specific autoimmune diseases.
 Evidence suggests a strong genetic component in the development of autoimmune diseases.[33] For instance, conditions such as lupus and multiple sclerosis frequently appear in multiple members of the same family, signifying a potential hereditary link. Furthermore, certain genes have been identified that augment the risk of developing specific autoimmune diseases.[34]
 Experimental methods like genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven instrumental in pinpointing genetic risk variants potentially responsible for autoimmune diseases. For example, these studies have been used to identify risk variants for diseases such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.[35]
 In twin studies, autoimmune diseases consistently demonstrate a higher concordance rate among identical twins compared with fraternal twins. For instance, the rate in multiple sclerosis is 35% in identical twins compared to 6% in fraternal twins.[36][37]
 There is increasing evidence that certain genes selected during evolution offer a balance between susceptibility to infection and the capacity to avoid autoimmune diseases.[38] For example, variants in the ERAP2 gene provide some resistance to infection even though they increase the risk of autoimmunity (positive selection). In contrast, variants in the TYK2 gene protect against autoimmune diseases but increase the risk of infection (negative selection). This suggests the benefits of infection resistance may outweigh the risks of autoimmune diseases, particularly given the historically high risk of infection.[38]
 Several experimental methods such as the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to identify genetic risk variants that may be responsible[39] for diseases such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.[40]
 A significant number of environmental factors have been implicated in the development and progression of various autoimmune diseases, either directly or as catalysts. Current research suggests that up to seventy percent of autoimmune diseases could be attributed to environmental influences, which encompass an array of elements such as chemicals, infectious agents, dietary habits, and gut dysbiosis. However, a unifying theory that definitively explains the onset of autoimmune diseases remains elusive, emphasizing the complexity and multifaceted nature of these conditions.[41]
 Various environmental triggers are identified, some of which include:
 Chemicals, which are either a part of the immediate environment or found in drugs, are key players in this context. Examples of such chemicals include hydrazines, hair dyes, trichloroethylene, tartrazines, hazardous wastes, and industrial emissions.[42]
 Ultraviolet (UV) radiation has been implicated as a potential causative factor in the development of autoimmune diseases, such as dermatomyositis.[43] Furthermore, exposure to pesticides has been linked with an increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.[44] Vitamin D, on the other hand, appears to play a protective role, particularly in older populations, by preventing immune dysfunctions.[45]
 Infectious agents are also being increasingly recognized for their role as T cell activators — a crucial step in triggering autoimmune diseases. The exact mechanisms by which they contribute to disease onset remain to be fully understood. For instance, certain autoimmune conditions like Guillain-Barre syndrome and rheumatic fever are thought to be triggered by infections.[46] Furthermore, analysis of large-scale data has revealed a significant link between SARS-CoV-2 infection (the causative agent of COVID-19) and an increased risk of developing a wide range of new-onset autoimmune diseases.[47]
 Women typically make up some 80% of autoimmune disease patients.[48] Whilst many proposals have been made for the cause of this high weighting, no clear explanation is available.[49][50] A possible role for hormonal factors has been suggested.[51] For example, some autoimmune diseases tend to flare during pregnancy (possibly as an evolutionary mechanism to increase health protection for the child),[50] when hormone levels are high, and improve after menopause, when hormone levels decrease. Women may also naturally have autoimmune disease trigger events in puberty and pregnancy.[48] Under-reporting by men may also be a factor, as men may interact less with the health system than women.[52][53][54][55][56]
 Certain viral and bacterial infections have been linked to autoimmune diseases.[57] For instance, research suggests that the bacterium that causes strep throat, Streptococcus pyogenes, might trigger rheumatic fever, an autoimmune response affecting the heart.[58] Similarly, some studies propose a link between the Epstein–Barr virus, responsible for mononucleosis, and the subsequent development of multiple sclerosis or lupus.
 Another area of interest is the immune system's ability to distinguish between self and non-self, a function that is compromised in autoimmune diseases. In healthy individuals, immune tolerance prevents the immune system from attacking the body's own cells. When this process fails, the immune system may produce antibodies against its own tissues, leading to an autoimmune response.[59]
 The elimination of self-reactive T cells occurs primarily through a mechanism known as ""negative selection"" within the thymus, an organ responsible for the maturation of T cells.[60] This process serves as a key line of defense against autoimmunity. If these protective mechanisms fail, a pool of self-reactive cells can become functional within the immune system, contributing to the development of autoimmune diseases.
 Some infectious agents, like Campylobacter jejuni, bear antigens that resemble, but are not identical to, the body's self-molecules. This phenomenon, known as molecular mimicry, can lead to cross-reactivity, where the immune response to such infections inadvertently results in the production of antibodies that also react with self-antigens.[61] An example of this is Guillain–Barré syndrome, in which antibodies generated in response to a C. jejuni infection also react with the gangliosides in the myelin sheath of peripheral nerve axons.[62]
 Diagnosing autoimmune disorders can be complex due to the wide range of diseases within this category and their often overlapping symptoms. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for determining appropriate treatment strategies. Generally, the diagnostic process involves a combination of medical history evaluation, physical examination, laboratory tests, and, in some cases, imaging or biopsies.[63]
 The first step in diagnosing autoimmune disorders typically involves a thorough evaluation of the patient's medical history and a comprehensive physical examination.[34] Clinicians often pay close attention to the patient's symptoms, family history of autoimmune diseases, and any exposure to environmental factors that might trigger an autoimmune response. The physical examination can reveal signs of inflammation or organ damage, which are common features of autoimmune disorders.
 Laboratory testing plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. These tests can identify the presence of certain autoantibodies or other immune markers that indicate a self-directed immune response.
 In some cases, imaging studies may be used to assess the extent of organ involvement and damage. For example, chest x-rays or CT scans can identify lung involvement in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, while an MRI can reveal inflammation or damage in the brain and spinal cord in multiple sclerosis.
 Given the variety and nonspecific nature of symptoms that can be associated with autoimmune diseases, differential diagnosis—determining which of several diseases with similar symptoms is causing a patient's illness—is an important part of the diagnostic process. This often involves ruling out other potential causes of symptoms, such as infections, malignancies, or genetic disorders.
 Given the systemic nature of many autoimmune disorders, a multidisciplinary approach may be necessary for their diagnosis and management. This can involve rheumatologists, endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, neurologists, dermatologists, and other specialists, depending on the organs or systems affected by the disease.
 In summary, the diagnosis of autoimmune disorders is a complex process that requires a thorough evaluation of clinical, laboratory, and imaging data. Due to the diverse nature of these diseases, an individualized approach, often involving multiple specialists, is crucial for an accurate diagnosis.
 Treatment depends on the type and severity of the condition. The majority of the autoimmune diseases are chronic and there is no definitive cure, but symptoms can be alleviated and controlled with treatment.[11]
Standard treatment methods include:[11]
 Traditional treatment options include immunosuppressant drugs to reduce the immune response against the body's own tissues, such as:[66]
 Because immunosuppressants weaken the overall immune response, relief of symptoms must be balanced with preserving the patient's ability to combat infections, which could potentially be life-threatening.[67]
 Non-traditional treatments are being researched, developed, and used, especially when traditional treatments fail. These methods aim to either block the activation of pathogenic cells in the body, or alter the pathway that suppresses these cells naturally.[67][68] These treatments aim to be less toxic to the patient and have more specific targets.[68] Such options include:
 Manage Autoimmune Disorders with Yoga:[71] Yoga, an ancient practice that integrates physical postures, breath control, and meditation, has shown promise in managing autoimmune disorders. Research indicates that regular yoga practice can reduce stress, a known trigger for autoimmune flare-ups, by promoting relaxation and mental clarity.
 The first estimate of US prevalence for autoimmune diseases as a group was published in 1997 by Jacobson, et al. They reported US prevalence to be around 9 million, applying prevalence estimates for 24 diseases to a US population of 279 million.[72] Jacobson's work was updated by Hayter & Cook in 2012.[73] This study used Witebsky's postulates, as revised by Rose & Bona,[74] to extend the list to 81 diseases and estimated overall cumulative US prevalence for the 81 autoimmune diseases at 5.0%, with 3.0% for males and 7.1% for females.
 The estimated community prevalence, which takes into account the observation that many people have more than one autoimmune disease, was 4.5% overall, with 2.7% for males and 6.4% for females.[73] National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys conducted in the US from the 1980s to 2020 showed an increase of antinuclear antibodies, a common biomarker for autoimmune diseases. This shows that there has been an increase in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases pointing to a stronger influence of environment factors as a risk factor for autoimmune diseases.[75]
 A 2024 estimate was that 1 in 15 people in the U.S. had at least one autoimmune disease.[76]
 In both autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, the condition arises through aberrant reactions of the human adaptive or innate immune systems. In autoimmunity, the patient's immune system is activated against the body's own proteins. In chronic inflammatory diseases, neutrophils and other leukocytes are constitutively recruited by cytokines and chemokines, resulting in tissue damage.[77]
 Mitigation of inflammation by activation of anti-inflammatory genes and the suppression of inflammatory genes in immune cells is a promising therapeutic approach.[78][79][80] There is a body of evidence that once the production of autoantibodies has been initialized, autoantibodies have the capacity to maintain their own production.[81]
 Stem cell transplantation is being studied and has shown promising results in certain cases.[82]
 Medical trials to replace the pancreatic β cells that are destroyed in type 1 diabetes are in progress.[83]
 According to this theory, the effector function of the immune response is mediated by the glycans (polysaccharides) displayed by the cells and humoral components of the immune system. Individuals with autoimmunity have alterations in their glycosylation profile such that a proinflammatory immune response is favored. It is further hypothesized that individual autoimmune diseases will have unique glycan signatures.[84]
 According to the hygiene hypothesis, high levels of cleanliness expose children to fewer antigens than in the past, causing their immune systems to become overactive and more likely to misidentify own tissues as foreign, resulting in autoimmune or allergic conditions such as asthma.[85]
 Vitamin D is known as an immune regulator that assists in the adaptive and innate immune response.[86][87] A deficiency in vitamin D, from hereditary or environmental influence, can lead to a more inefficient and weaker immune response and seen as a contributing factor to the development of autoimmune diseases.[87] With vitamin D present, vitamin D response elements (VDRE) are encoded and expressed via pattern recognition receptors (PRR) responses and the genes associated with those responses.[86] The specific DNA target sequence expressed is known as 1,25-(OH)2D3.[86] The expression of 1,25-(OH)2D3 can be induced by macrophages, dendritic cells, T-cells, and B-cells.[86] In the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3, the immune system's production of inflammatory cytokines are suppressed and more tolerogenic regulatory T-cells are expressed.[86] This is due to vitamin D's influence on cell maturation, specifically T-cells, and their phenotype expression.[86] Lack of 1,25-(OH)2D3 expression can lead to less tolerant regulatory T-cells, larger presentation of antigens to less tolerant T-cells, and increased inflammatory response.[86]

 Coeliac disease is a condition where your immune system attacks your own tissues when you eat gluten. This damages your gut (small intestine) so your body cannot properly take in nutrients. Coeliac disease can cause a range of symptoms, including diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating. Coeliac disease is caused by an adverse reaction to gluten, which is a dietary protein found in 3 types of cereal: Gluten is found in any food that contains those cereals, including: In addition, most beers are made with barley. Eating foods that contain gluten can trigger a range of gut symptoms, such as: Coeliac disease can also cause more general symptoms, including: Children with coeliac disease may not grow at the expected rate and may have delayed puberty. Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition. This is where the immune system (the body's defence against infection) mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In coeliac disease, the immune system mistakes substances found inside gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them. This damages the surface of the small bowel (intestines), disrupting the body's ability to take in nutrients from food. It's not entirely clear what causes the immune system to act this way, but a combination of genetics and the environment appear to play a part. There's no cure for coeliac disease, but following a gluten-free diet should help control symptoms and prevent the long-term complications of the condition. Even if you have mild symptoms, changing your diet is still recommended because continuing to eat gluten can lead to serious complications. This may also be the case if tests show that you have some degree of coeliac disease even if you do not have noticeable symptoms. It's important to ensure that your gluten-free diet is healthy and balanced. An increase in the range of available gluten-free foods in recent years has made it possible to eat both a healthy and varied gluten-free diet. Complications of coeliac disease only tend to affect people who continue to eat gluten, or those who have not yet been diagnosed with the condition, which can be a common problem in milder cases. Potential long-term complications include: Less common and more serious complications include some types of cancers, such as bowel cancer, and problems affecting pregnancy, such as your baby having a low birth weight. Find out more about the complications of coeliac disease. Coeliac disease is a condition that affects at least 1 in every 100 people in the UK. But some experts think this may be underestimated because milder cases may go undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed as other digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Reported cases of coeliac disease are higher in women than men. It can develop at any age. People with certain conditions, including type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease, Down's syndrome and Turner syndrome, have an increased risk of getting coeliac disease. First-degree relatives (parents, brothers, sisters and children) of people with coeliac disease are also at increased risk of developing the condition. Routine testing for coeliac disease is not done in England. Testing is usually only recommended for people who have symptoms, or who have an increased risk of developing coeliac disease, such as those with a family history of the condition. First-degree relatives of people with coeliac disease should be tested. Read about diagnosing coeliac disease for more information about when testing for coeliac disease should be done.

 Coeliac disease (British English) or celiac disease (American English) is a long-term autoimmune disorder, primarily affecting the small intestine, where individuals develop intolerance to gluten, present in foods such as wheat, rye and barley.[10] Classic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhoea, abdominal distention, malabsorption, loss of appetite, and among children failure to grow normally.[1] Non-classic symptoms are more common, especially in people older than two years.[8][15][16] There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms, a wide number of symptoms involving any part of the body, or no obvious symptoms.[1] Coeliac disease was first described in childhood;[6][8] however, it may develop at any age.[1][8] It is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes mellitus and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, among others.[6]
 Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to gluten, a group of various proteins found in wheat and in other grains such as barley and rye.[9][17][18] Moderate quantities of oats, free of contamination with other gluten-containing grains, are usually tolerated.[17][19] The occurrence of problems may depend on the variety of oat.[17][20] It occurs more often in people who are genetically predisposed.[10] Upon exposure to gluten, an abnormal immune response may lead to the production of several different autoantibodies that can affect a number of different organs.[4][21] In the small bowel, this causes an inflammatory reaction and may produce shortening of the villi lining the small intestine (villous atrophy).[10][11] This affects the absorption of nutrients, frequently leading to anaemia.[10][18]
 Diagnosis is typically made by a combination of blood antibody tests and intestinal biopsies, helped by specific genetic testing.[10] Making the diagnosis is not always straightforward.[22] About 10% of the time, the autoantibodies in the blood are negative,[23][24] and many people have only minor intestinal changes with normal villi.[25] People may have severe symptoms and they may be investigated for years before a diagnosis is achieved.[26][27] As a result of screening, the diagnosis is increasingly being made in people who have no symptoms.[28] Evidence regarding the effects of screening, however, is not sufficient to determine its usefulness.[29] While the disease is caused by a permanent intolerance to gluten proteins,[10] it is distinct from wheat allergy, which is much more rare.[30]
 The only known effective treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet, which leads to recovery of the intestinal lining (mucous membrane), improves symptoms, and reduces the risk of developing complications in most people.[13] If untreated, it may result in cancers such as intestinal lymphoma, and a slightly increased risk of early death.[3] Rates vary between different regions of the world, from as few as 1 in 300 to as many as 1 in 40, with an average of between 1 in 100 and 1 in 170 people.[14] It is estimated that 80% of cases remain undiagnosed, usually because of minimal or absent gastrointestinal complaints and lack of knowledge of symptoms and diagnostic criteria.[5][26][31] Coeliac disease is slightly more common in women than in men.[32]
 The classic symptoms of untreated coeliac disease include pale, loose, or greasy stools (steatorrhoea), and weight loss or failure to gain weight. Other common symptoms may be subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself.[33] It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any of the classic symptoms at all.[18] This has been shown to comprise at least 43% of presentations in children.[34] Further, many adults with subtle disease may only present with fatigue, anaemia or low bone mass.[28] Many undiagnosed individuals who consider themselves asymptomatic are in fact not, but rather have become accustomed to living in a state of chronically compromised health. Indeed, after starting a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease that they had mistakenly ignored.[5][27][31]
 Diarrhoea that is characteristic of coeliac disease is chronic, sometimes pale, of large volume, and abnormally foul in odor. Abdominal pain, cramping, bloating with abdominal distension (thought to be the result of fermentative production of bowel gas), and mouth ulcers[35] may be present. As the bowel becomes more damaged, a degree of lactose intolerance may develop.[18] Frequently, the symptoms are ascribed to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), only later to be recognised as coeliac disease. In populations of people with symptoms of IBS, a diagnosis of coeliac disease can be made in about 3.3% of cases, or four times more likely than in general.[36] Screening them for coeliac disease is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), the British Society of Gastroenterology and the American College of Gastroenterology, but is of unclear benefit in North America.[36][37]
 Coeliac disease leads to an increased risk of both adenocarcinoma and lymphoma of the small bowel (enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) or other non-Hodgkin lymphomas).[38] This risk is also higher in first-degree relatives such as siblings, parents and children. Whether a gluten-free diet brings this risk back to baseline is not clear.[39] Long-standing and untreated disease may lead to other complications, such as ulcerative jejunitis (ulcer formation of the small bowel) and stricturing (narrowing as a result of scarring with obstruction of the bowel).[40]
 The changes in the bowel reduce its ability to absorb nutrients, minerals, and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K.[18][41]
 Coeliac disease has been linked with many conditions. In many cases, it is unclear whether the gluten-induced bowel disease is a causative factor or whether these conditions share a common predisposition.
 Coeliac disease is associated with several other medical conditions, many of which are autoimmune disorders: diabetes mellitus type 1, hypothyroidism, primary biliary cholangitis, microscopic colitis, gluten ataxia, psoriasis, vitiligo, autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and more.[4]
 Coeliac disease is caused by an inflammatory reaction to gliadins and glutenins (gluten proteins)[49] found in wheat and to similar proteins found in the crops of the tribe Triticeae (which includes other common grains such as barley and rye)[18] and to the tribe Aveneae (oats).[50] Wheat subspecies (such as spelt, durum, and Kamut) and wheat hybrids (such as triticale) also cause symptoms of coeliac disease.[50][51]
 A small number of people with coeliac disease react to oats.[18] Oat toxicity in coeliac people depends on the oat cultivar consumed because the prolamin genes, protein amino acid sequences, and the immunoreactivities of toxic prolamins are different in different oat varieties.[20][52] Also, oats are frequently cross-contaminated with other grains containing gluten.[20][52][53] The term ""pure oats"" refers to oats uncontaminated with other gluten-containing cereals.[20] The long-term effects of pure oat consumption are still unclear,[54] and further studies identifying the cultivars used are needed before making final recommendations on their inclusion in a gluten-free diet.[53] Coeliac people who choose to consume oats need a more rigorous lifelong follow-up, possibly including periodic intestinal biopsies.[54]
 Other cereals such as corn, millet, sorghum, teff, rice, and wild rice are safe for people with coeliac disease to consume, as well as non-cereals such as amaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat.[51][55] Noncereal carbohydrate-rich foods such as potatoes and bananas do not contain gluten and do not trigger symptoms.[51]
 There are various theories as to what determines whether a genetically susceptible individual will go on to develop coeliac disease. Major theories include surgery, pregnancy, infection and emotional stress.[56]
 The eating of gluten early in a baby's life does not appear to increase the risk of coeliac disease but later introduction after six months may increase it.[57][58] There is uncertainty whether being breastfed reduces risk. Prolonging breastfeeding until the introduction of gluten-containing grains into the diet appears to be associated with a 50% reduced risk of developing coeliac disease in infancy; whether this persists into adulthood is not clear.[59] These factors may just influence the timing of onset.[60]
 Coeliac disease appears to be multifactorial, both in that more than one genetic factor can cause the disease and in that more than one factor is necessary for the disease to manifest in a person. [61]
 Almost all people (95%) with coeliac disease have either the variant HLA-DQ2 allele or (less commonly) the HLA-DQ8 allele.[28][62] However, about 20–30% of people without coeliac disease have also inherited either of these alleles.[63] This suggests that additional factors are needed for coeliac disease to develop; that is, the predisposing HLA risk allele is necessary but not sufficient to develop coeliac disease. Furthermore, around 5% of those people who do develop coeliac disease do not have typical HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 alleles (see below).[28]
 The vast majority of people with coeliac have one of two types (out of seven) of the HLA-DQ protein.[63] HLA-DQ is part of the MHC class II antigen-presenting receptor (also called the human leukocyte antigen) system and distinguishes cells between self and non-self for the purposes of the immune system. The two subunits of the HLA-DQ protein are encoded by the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, located on the short arm of chromosome 6.[citation needed]
 There are seven HLA-DQ variants (DQ2 and DQ4–DQ9). Over 95% of people with coeliac have the isoform of DQ2 or DQ8, which is inherited in families. The reason these genes produce an increase in the risk of coeliac disease is that the receptors formed by these genes bind to gliadin peptides more tightly than other forms of the antigen-presenting receptor. Therefore, these forms of the receptor are more likely to activate T lymphocytes and initiate the autoimmune process.[28]
 Most people with coeliac bear a two-gene HLA-DQ2 haplotype referred to as DQ2.5 haplotype. This haplotype is composed of two adjacent gene alleles, DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201, which encode the two subunits, DQ α5 and DQ β2. In most individuals, this DQ2.5 isoform is encoded by one of two chromosomes 6 inherited from parents (DQ2.5cis). Most coeliacs inherit only one copy of this DQ2.5 haplotype, while some inherit it from both parents; the latter are especially at risk for coeliac disease as well as being more susceptible to severe complications.[65]
 Some individuals inherit DQ2.5 from one parent and an additional portion of the haplotype (either DQB1*02 or DQA1*05) from the other parent, increasing risk. Less commonly, some individuals inherit the DQA1*05 allele from one parent and the DQB1*02 from the other parent (DQ2.5trans) (called a trans-haplotype association), and these individuals are at similar risk for coeliac disease as those with a single DQ2.5-bearing chromosome 6, but in this instance, the disease tends not to be familial. Among the 6% of European coeliacs that do not have DQ2.5 (cis or trans) or DQ8 (encoded by the haplotype DQA1*03:DQB1*0302), 4% have the DQ2.2 isoform, and the remaining 2% lack DQ2 or DQ8.[66]
 The frequency of these genes varies geographically. DQ2.5 has high frequency in peoples of North and Western Europe (Basque Country and Ireland[67] with highest frequencies) and portions of Africa and is associated with disease in India,[68] but it is not found along portions of the West Pacific rim. DQ8 has a wider global distribution than DQ2.5 and is particularly common in South and Central America; up to 90% of individuals in certain Amerindian populations carry DQ8 and thus may display the coeliac phenotype.[69]
 Other genetic factors have been repeatedly reported in coeliac disease; however, involvement in disease has variable geographic recognition. Only the HLA-DQ loci show a consistent involvement over the global population.[70] Many of the loci detected have been found in association with other autoimmune diseases. One locus, the LPP or lipoma-preferred partner gene, is involved in the adhesion of extracellular matrix to the cell surface, and a minor variant (SNP=rs1464510) increases the risk of disease by approximately 30%. This gene strongly associates with coeliac disease (p < 10−39) in samples taken from a broad area of Europe and the US.[70]
 The prevalence of coeliac disease genotypes in the modern population is not completely understood. Given the characteristics of the disease and its apparent strong heritability, it would normally be expected that the genotypes would undergo negative selection and to be absent in societies where agriculture has been practised the longest (compare with a similar condition, lactose intolerance, which has been negatively selected so strongly that its prevalence went from ~100% in ancestral populations to less than 5% in some European countries). This expectation was first proposed by Simoons (1981).[71] By now, however, it is apparent that this is not the case; on the contrary, there is evidence of positive selection in coeliac disease genotypes. It is suspected that some of them may have been beneficial by providing protection against bacterial infections.[72][73]
 The majority of the proteins in food responsible for the immune reaction in coeliac disease are the prolamins. These are storage proteins rich in proline (prol-) and glutamine (-amin) that dissolve in alcohols and are resistant to proteases and peptidases of the gut.[28][74] Prolamins are found in cereal grains with different grains having different but related prolamins: wheat (gliadin), barley (hordein), rye (secalin) and oats (avenin).[50] One region of α-gliadin stimulates membrane cells, enterocytes, of the intestine to allow larger molecules around the sealant between cells. Disruption of tight junctions allow peptides larger than three amino acids to enter the intestinal lining.[75]
 Membrane leaking permits peptides of gliadin that stimulate two levels of the immune response: the innate response, and the adaptive (T-helper cell-mediated) response. One protease-resistant peptide from α-gliadin contains a region that stimulates lymphocytes and results in the release of interleukin-15. This innate response to gliadin results in immune-system signalling that attracts inflammatory cells and increases the release of inflammatory chemicals.[28] The strongest and most common adaptive response to gliadin is directed toward an α2-gliadin fragment of 33 amino acids in length.[28]
 The response to the 33mer occurs in most coeliacs who have a DQ2 isoform. This peptide, when altered by intestinal transglutaminase, has a high density of overlapping T-cell epitopes. This increases the likelihood that the DQ2 isoform will bind, and stay bound to, peptide when recognised by T-cells.[76] Gliadin in wheat is the best-understood member of this family, but other prolamins exist, and hordein (from barley), secalin (from rye), and avenin (from oats) may contribute to coeliac disease.[28][50][77] Avenin's toxicity in people with coeliac disease depends on the oat cultivar consumed, as prolamin genes, protein amino acid sequences, and the immunoreactivities of toxic prolamins vary among oat varieties.[20]
 Anti-transglutaminase antibodies to the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG) are found in the blood of the majority of people with classic symptoms and complete villous atrophy, but only in 70% of the cases with partial villous atrophy and 30% of the cases with minor mucosal lesions.[23] Tissue transglutaminase modifies gluten peptides into a form that may stimulate the immune system more effectively.[28] These peptides are modified by tTG in two ways, deamidation or transamidation.[78]
 Deamidation is the reaction by which a glutamate residue is formed by cleavage of the epsilon-amino group of a glutamine side chain. Transamidation, which occurs three times more often than deamidation, is the cross-linking of a glutamine residue from the gliadin peptide to a lysine residue of tTg in a reaction that is catalysed by the transglutaminase. Crosslinking may occur either within or outside the active site of the enzyme. The latter case yields a permanently covalently linked complex between the gliadin and the tTg.[79] This results in the formation of new epitopes believed to trigger the primary immune response by which the autoantibodies against tTg develop.[80][81][82]
 Stored biopsies from people with suspected coeliac disease have revealed that autoantibody deposits in the subclinical coeliacs are detected prior to clinical disease. These deposits are also found in people who present with other autoimmune diseases, anaemia, or malabsorption phenomena at a much increased rate over the normal population.[83] Endomysial components of antibodies (EMA) to tTG are believed to be directed toward cell-surface transglutaminase, and these antibodies are still used in confirming a coeliac disease diagnosis. However, a 2006 study showed that EMA-negative people with coeliac tend to be older males with more severe abdominal symptoms and a lower frequency of ""atypical"" symptoms, including autoimmune disease.[84] In this study, the anti-tTG antibody deposits did not correlate with the severity of villous destruction. These findings, coupled with work showing that gliadin has an innate response component,[85] suggest that gliadin may be more responsible for the primary manifestations of coeliac disease, whereas tTG is a bigger factor in secondary effects such as allergic responses and secondary autoimmune diseases. In a large percentage of people with coeliac, the anti-tTG antibodies also recognise a rotavirus protein called VP7. These antibodies stimulate monocyte proliferation, and rotavirus infection might explain some early steps in the cascade of immune cell proliferation.[86]
 Indeed, earlier studies of rotavirus damage in the gut showed this causes villous atrophy.[87] This suggests that viral proteins may take part in the initial flattening and stimulate self-crossreactive anti-VP7 production. Antibodies to VP7 may also slow healing until the gliadin-mediated tTG presentation provides a second source of crossreactive antibodies.[citation needed]
 Other intestinal disorders may have biopsy that look like coeliac disease including lesions caused by Candida.[88]
 The inflammatory process, mediated by T cells, leads to disruption of the structure and function of the small bowel's mucosal lining and causes malabsorption as it impairs the body's ability to absorb nutrients, minerals, and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K from food. Lactose intolerance may be present due to the decreased bowel surface and reduced production of lactase but typically resolves once the condition is treated.[citation needed]
 Alternative causes of this tissue damage have been proposed and involve the release of interleukin 15 and activation of the innate immune system by a shorter gluten peptide (p31–43/49). This would trigger killing of enterocytes by lymphocytes in the epithelium.[28] The villous atrophy seen on biopsy may also be due to unrelated causes, such as tropical sprue, giardiasis and radiation enteritis. While positive serology and typical biopsy are highly suggestive of coeliac disease, lack of response to the diet may require these alternative diagnoses to be considered.[40]
 Diagnosis is often difficult and as of 2019, there continues to be a lack of awareness among physicians about the variability of presentations of coeliac disease and the diagnostic criteria, such that most cases are diagnosed with great delay.[26][22] It can take up to 12 years to receive a diagnosis from the onset of symptoms and the majority of those affected in most countries never receive it.[26]
 Several tests can be used. The level of symptoms may determine the order of the tests, but all tests lose their usefulness if the person is already eating a gluten-free diet. Intestinal damage begins to heal within weeks of gluten being removed from the diet, and antibody levels decline over months. For those who have already started on a gluten-free diet, it may be necessary to perform a rechallenge with some gluten-containing food in one meal a day over six weeks before repeating the investigations.[21]
 Serological blood tests are the first-line investigation required to make a diagnosis of coeliac disease. Its sensitivity correlates with the degree of histological lesions. People who present with minor damage to the small intestine may have seronegative findings so many patients with coeliac disease often are missed. In patients with villous atrophy, anti-endomysial (EMA) antibodies of the immunoglobulin A (IgA) type can detect coeliac disease with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 99%, respectively.[89] Serology for anti-transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) was initially reported to have a higher sensitivity (99%) and specificity (>90%). However, it is now thought to have similar characteristics to anti-endomysial antibodies.[89] Both anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies have high sensitivity to diagnose people with classic symptoms and complete villous atrophy, but they are only found in 30–89% of the cases with partial villous atrophy and in less than 50% of the people who have minor mucosal lesions (duodenal lymphocytosis) with normal villi.[23][24]
 Tissue transglutaminase (abbreviated as tTG or TG2) modifies gluten peptides into a form that may stimulate the immune system more effectively.[28] These peptides are modified by tTG in two ways, deamidation or transamidation.[78] Modern anti-tTG assays rely on a human recombinant protein as an antigen.[90] tTG testing should be done first as it is an easier test to perform. An equivocal result on tTG testing should be followed by anti-endomysial antibodies.[21]
 Guidelines recommend that a total serum IgA level is checked in parallel, as people with coeliac with IgA deficiency may be unable to produce the antibodies on which these tests depend (""false negative""). In those people, IgG antibodies against transglutaminase (IgG-tTG) may be diagnostic.[21][91]
 If all these antibodies are negative, then anti-DGP antibodies (antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides) should be determined. IgG class anti-DGP antibodies may be useful in people with IgA deficiency. In children younger than two years, anti-DGP antibodies perform better than anti-endomysial and anti-transglutaminase antibodies tests.[8]
 Because of the major implications of a diagnosis of coeliac disease, professional guidelines recommend that a positive blood test is still followed by an endoscopy/gastroscopy and biopsy. A negative serology test may still be followed by a recommendation for endoscopy and duodenal biopsy if clinical suspicion remains high.[21][40][92]
 Historically three other antibodies were measured: anti-reticulin (ARA), anti-gliadin (AGA) and anti-endomysial (EMA) antibodies.[93] ARA testing, however, is not accurate enough for routine diagnostic use.[94] Serology may be unreliable in young children, with anti-gliadin performing somewhat better than other tests in children under five.[93] Serology tests are based on indirect immunofluorescence (reticulin, gliadin and endomysium) or ELISA (gliadin or tissue transglutaminase, tTG).[95]
 Other antibodies such as anti–Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies occur in some people with coeliac disease but also occur in other autoimmune disorders and about 5% of those who donate blood.[96]
 Antibody testing may be combined with HLA testing if the diagnosis is unclear. TGA and EMA testing are the most sensitive serum antibody tests, but as a negative HLA-DQ type excludes the diagnosis of coeliac disease, testing also for HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 maximises sensitivity and negative predictive values.[63] In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) does not (as of 2015) recommend the use of HLA typing to rule out coeliac disease outside of a specialist setting, for example, in children who are not having a biopsy, or in patients who already have limited gluten ingestion and opt not to have a gluten challenge.[21]
 An upper endoscopy with biopsy of the duodenum (beyond the duodenal bulb) or jejunum is performed to obtain multiple samples (four to eight) from the duodenum. Not all areas may be equally affected; if biopsies are taken from healthy bowel tissue, the result would be a false negative.[40] Even in the same bioptic fragment, different degrees of
damage may be present.[16]
 Most people with coeliac disease have a small intestine that appears to be normal on endoscopy before the biopsies are examined. However, five findings have been associated with high specificity for coeliac disease: scalloping of the small bowel folds (pictured), paucity in the folds, a mosaic pattern to the mucosa (described as a ""cracked-mud"" appearance), prominence of the submucosa blood vessels, and a nodular pattern to the mucosa.[97]
 European guidelines suggest that in children and adolescents with symptoms compatible with coeliac disease, the diagnosis can be made without the need for intestinal biopsy if anti-tTG antibodies titres are very high (10 times the upper limit of normal).[8]
 Until the 1970s, biopsies were obtained using metal capsules attached to a suction device. The capsule was swallowed and allowed to pass into the small intestine. After x-ray verification of its position, suction was applied to collect part of the intestinal wall inside the capsule. Often-utilised capsule systems were the Watson capsule and the Crosby–Kugler capsule. This method has now been largely replaced by fibre-optic endoscopy, which carries a higher sensitivity and a lower frequency of errors.[98]
 Capsule endoscopy (CE) allows identification of typical mucosal changes observed in coeliac disease but has a lower sensitivity compared to regular endoscopy and histology. CE is therefore not the primary diagnostic tool for coeliac disease. However, CE can be used for diagnosing T-cell lymphoma, ulcerative jejunoileitis, and adenocarcinoma in refractory or complicated coeliac disease.[99]
 The classic pathology changes of coeliac disease in the small bowel are categorised by the ""Marsh classification"":[100]
 Marsh's classification, introduced in 1992, was subsequently modified in 1999 to six stages, where the previous stage 3 was split in three substages.[102] Further studies demonstrated that this system was not always reliable and that the changes observed in coeliac disease could be described in one of three stages:[18][103]
 The changes classically improve or reverse after gluten is removed from the diet. However, most guidelines do not recommend a repeat biopsy unless there is no improvement in the symptoms on diet.[40][92] In some cases, a deliberate gluten challenge, followed by a biopsy, may be conducted to confirm or refute the diagnosis. A normal biopsy and normal serology after challenge indicates the diagnosis may have been incorrect.[40]
 In untreated coeliac disease, villous atrophy is more common in children younger than three years, but in older children and adults, it is common to find minor intestinal lesions (duodenal lymphocytosis) with normal intestinal villi.[11][25]
 At the time of diagnosis, further investigations may be performed to identify complications, such as iron deficiency (by full blood count and iron studies), folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency and hypocalcaemia (low calcium levels, often due to decreased vitamin D levels). Thyroid function tests may be requested during blood tests to identify hypothyroidism, which is more common in people with coeliac disease.[41]
 Osteopenia and osteoporosis, mildly and severely reduced bone mineral density, are often present in people with coeliac disease, and investigations to measure bone density may be performed at diagnosis, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning, to identify the risk of fracture and need for bone protection medication.[40][41]
 Although blood antibody tests, biopsies, and genetic tests usually provide a clear diagnosis,[24][89] occasionally the response to gluten withdrawal on a gluten-free diet is needed to support the diagnosis. Currently, gluten challenge is no longer required to confirm the diagnosis in patients with intestinal lesions compatible with coeliac disease and a positive response to a gluten-free diet.[24] Nevertheless, in some cases, a gluten challenge with a subsequent biopsy may be useful to support the diagnosis, for example in people with a high suspicion for coeliac disease, without a biopsy confirmation, who have negative blood antibodies and are already on a gluten-free diet.[24] Gluten challenge is discouraged before the age of 5 years and during pubertal growth.[104] The alternative diagnosis of non-coeliac gluten sensitivity may be made where there is only symptomatic evidence of gluten sensitivity.[105] Gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms of people with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity can be similar to those of coeliac disease,[16] and improve when gluten is removed from the diet,[106][107] after coeliac disease and wheat allergy are reasonably excluded.[108]
 Up to 30% of people often continue having or redeveloping symptoms after starting a gluten-free diet.[13] A careful interpretation of the symptomatic response is needed, as a lack of response in a person with coeliac disease may be due to continued ingestion of small amounts of gluten, either voluntary or inadvertent,[11] or be due to other commonly associated conditions such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), lactose intolerance, fructose,[109] sucrose,[110] and sorbitol[111] malabsorption, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency,[112][113] and microscopic colitis,[113] among others. In untreated coeliac disease, these are often transient conditions derived from the intestinal damage.[110][111][114][115][116] They normally revert or improve several months after starting a gluten-free diet, but may need temporary interventions such as supplementation with pancreatic enzymes,[115][116] dietary restrictions of lactose, fructose, sucrose or sorbitol containing foods,[110][114] or treatment with oral antibiotics in the case of associated bacterial overgrowth.[116] In addition to gluten withdrawal, some people need to follow a low-FODMAPs diet or avoid consumption of commercial gluten-free products, which are usually rich in preservatives and additives (such as sulfites, glutamates, nitrates and benzoates) and might have a role in triggering functional gastrointestinal symptoms.[117]
 There is debate as to the benefits of screening. As of 2017, the United States Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation among those without symptoms.[29] In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommend testing for coeliac disease in first-degree relatives of those with the disease already confirmed, in people with persistent fatigue, abdominal or gastrointestinal symptoms, faltering growth, unexplained weight loss or iron, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, severe mouth ulcers, and with diagnoses of type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disease,[21] and with newly diagnosed chronic fatigue syndrome[118] and irritable bowel syndrome.[37] Dermatitis herpetiformis is included in other recommendations.[119] The NICE also recommend offering serological testing for coeliac disease in people with metabolic bone disease (reduced bone mineral density or osteomalacia), unexplained neurological disorders (such as peripheral neuropathy and ataxia), fertility problems or recurrent miscarriage, persistently raised liver enzymes with unknown cause, dental enamel defects and with diagnose of Down syndrome or Turner syndrome.[21]
 Some evidence has found that early detection may decrease the risk of developing health complications, such as osteoporosis, anaemia, and certain types of cancer, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and reproductive problems.[7][28][46][120][121] They thus recommend screening in people with certain health problems.[121]
 Serology has been proposed as a screening measure, because the presence of antibodies would detect some previously undiagnosed cases of coeliac disease and prevent its complications in those people. However, serologic tests have high sensitivity only in people with total villous atrophy and have a very low ability to detect cases with partial villous atrophy or minor intestinal lesions.[24] Testing for coeliac disease may be offered to those with commonly associated conditions.[18][21]
 At present, the only effective treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet.[51] No medication exists that prevents damage or prevents the body from attacking the gut when gluten is present. Strict adherence to the diet helps the intestines heal, leading to resolution of all symptoms in most cases and, depending on how soon the diet is begun, can also eliminate the heightened risk of osteoporosis and intestinal cancer and in some cases sterility.[122] Compliance to a strict gluten-free diet is difficult for the patient, but evidence has accumulated that a strict gluten-free diet can result in resolution of diarrhea, weight gain and normalization of nutrient malabsorption, with normalization of biopsies in 6 months to 2 years on a gluten-free diet.[123]
 Dietitian input is generally requested to ensure the person is aware which foods contain gluten, which foods are safe, and how to have a balanced diet despite the limitations. In many countries, gluten-free products are available on prescription and may be reimbursed by health insurance plans. Gluten-free products are usually more expensive and harder to find than common gluten-containing foods.[124] Since ready-made products often contain traces of gluten, some coeliacs may find it necessary to cook from scratch.[125]
 The term ""gluten-free"" is generally used to indicate a supposed harmless level of gluten rather than a complete absence.[126] The exact level at which gluten is harmless is uncertain and controversial. A recent systematic review tentatively concluded that consumption of less than 10 mg of gluten per day is unlikely to cause histological abnormalities, although it noted that few reliable studies had been done.[126] Regulation of the label ""gluten-free"" varies. In the European Union, the European Commission issued regulations in 2009 limiting the use of ""gluten-free"" labels for food products to those with less than 20 mg/kg of gluten, and ""very low gluten"" labels for those with less than 100 mg/kg.[127] In the United States, the FDA issued regulations in 2013 limiting the use of ""gluten-free"" labels for food products to those with less than 20 ppm of gluten.[128][129][130] The current international Codex Alimentarius standard allows for 20 ppm of gluten in so-called ""gluten-free"" foods.[131]
 Gluten-free diet improves healthcare-related quality of life, and strict adherence to the diet gives more benefit than incomplete adherence. Nevertheless, gluten-free diet does not completely normalise the quality of life.[132]
 Even though it is unclear if coeliac patients have a generally increased risk of infectious diseases, they should generally be encouraged to receive all common vaccines against vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) as the general population. Moreover, some pathogens could be harmful to coeliac patients. According to the European Society for the Study of Celiac Disease (ESsCD), coeliac disease can be associated with hyposplenism or functional asplenia, which could result in impaired immunity to encapsulated bacteria, with an increased risk of such infections. For this reason, patients who are known to be hyposplenic should be administered at least the pneumococcal vaccine.[133] However, the ESsCD states that it is not clear whether vaccination with the conjugated vaccine is preferable in this setting and whether additional vaccination against Haemophilus, meningococcus, and influenza should be considered if not previously given.[134] However, Mårild et al. suggested considering additional vaccination against influenza because of an observed increased risk of hospital admission for this infection in celiac patients.[135]
 Between 0.3% and 10% of affected people have refractory disease, which means that they have persistent villous atrophy on a gluten-free diet despite the lack of gluten exposure for more than 12 months.[113] Nevertheless, inadvertent exposure to gluten is the main cause of persistent villous atrophy, and must be ruled out before a diagnosis of refractory disease is made.[113] People with poor basic education and understanding of gluten-free diet often believe that they are strictly following the diet, but are making regular errors.[13][113][136] Also, a lack of symptoms is not a reliable indicator of intestinal recuperation.[113]
 If alternative causes of villous atrophy have been eliminated, steroids or immunosuppressants (such as azathioprine) may be considered in this scenario.[40]
 Refractory coeliac disease should not be confused with the persistence of symptoms despite gluten withdrawal[113] caused by transient conditions derived from the intestinal damage,[110][111][114] which generally revert or improve several months after starting a gluten-free diet,[115][116] such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, lactose intolerance, fructose,[109] sucrose,[110] and sorbitol[111] malabsorption, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency,[112][113] and microscopic colitis[113] among others.
 Globally coeliac disease affects between 1 in 100 and 1 in 170 people.[14][137] Rates, however, vary between different regions of the world from as few as 1 in 300 to as many as 1 in 40.[14] In the United States it is thought to affect between 1 in 1750 (defined as clinical disease including dermatitis herpetiformis with limited digestive tract symptoms) to 1 in 105 (defined by presence of IgA TG in blood donors).[138] Due to variable signs and symptoms it is believed that about 85% of people affected are undiagnosed.[139] The percentage of people with clinically diagnosed disease (symptoms prompting diagnostic testing) is 0.05–0.27% in various studies. However, population studies from parts of Europe, India, South America, Australasia and the USA (using serology and biopsy) indicate that the percentage of people with the disease may be between 0.33 and 1.06% in children (but 5.66% in one study of children of the predisposed Sahrawi people[140]) and 0.18–1.2% in adults.[28] Among those in primary care populations who report gastrointestinal symptoms, the rate of coeliac disease is about 3%.[89] In Australia, approximately 1 in 70 people have the disease.[141] The rate amongst adult blood donors in Iran, Israel, Syria and Turkey is 0.60%, 0.64%, 1.61% and 1.15%, respectively.[39]
 People of African, Japanese and Chinese descent are rarely diagnosed;[142] this reflects a much lower prevalence of the genetic risk factors, such as HLA-B8.[143] People of Indian ancestry seem to have a similar risk to those of Western Caucasian ancestry.[39] Population studies also indicate that a large proportion of coeliacs remain undiagnosed; this is due, in part, to many clinicians being unfamiliar with the condition and also due to the fact it can be asymptomatic.[144] Coeliac disease is slightly more common in women than in men.[32] A large multicentre study in the U.S. found a prevalence of 0.75% in not-at-risk groups, rising to 1.8% in symptomatic people, 2.6% in second-degree relatives (like grandparents, aunt or uncle, grandchildren, etc.) of a person with coeliac disease and 4.5% in first-degree relatives (siblings, parents or children).[39] This profile is similar to the prevalence in Europe.[39] Other populations at increased risk for coeliac disease, with prevalence rates ranging from 5% to 10%, include individuals with Down and Turner syndromes, type 1 diabetes, and autoimmune thyroid disease, including both hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).[145]
 Historically, coeliac disease was thought to be rare, with a prevalence of about 0.02%.[145] The reason for the recent increases in the number of reported cases is unclear.[137] It may be at least in part due to changes in diagnostic practice.[146] There also appears to be an approximately 4.5 fold true increase that may be due to less exposure to bacteria and other pathogens in Western environments.[137] In the United States, the median age at diagnosis is 38 years.[147] Roughly 20 percent of individuals with coeliac disease are diagnosed after 60 years of age.[147]
 The term coeliac comes from Greek κοιλιακός (koiliakós) 'abdominal' and was introduced in the 19th century in a translation of what is generally regarded as an Ancient Greek description of the disease by Aretaeus of Cappadocia.[148][149]
 Humans first started to cultivate grains in the Neolithic period (beginning about 9500 BCE) in the Fertile Crescent in Western Asia, and, likely, coeliac disease did not occur before this time. Aretaeus of Cappadocia, living in the second century in the same area, recorded a malabsorptive syndrome with chronic diarrhoea, causing a debilitation of the whole body.[148] His ""Cœliac Affection"" gained the attention of Western medicine when Francis Adams presented a translation of Aretaeus's work at the Sydenham Society in 1856. The patient described in Aretaeus' work had stomach pain and was atrophied, pale, feeble, and incapable of work. The diarrhoea manifested as loose stools that were white, malodorous, and flatulent, and the disease was intractable and liable to periodic return. The problem, Aretaeus believed, was a lack of heat in the stomach necessary to digest the food and a reduced ability to distribute the digestive products throughout the body, this incomplete digestion resulting in diarrhoea. He regarded this as an affliction of the old and more commonly affecting women, explicitly excluding children. The cause, according to Aretaeus, was sometimes either another chronic disease or even consuming ""a copious draught of cold water.""[148][149]
 The paediatrician Samuel Gee gave the first modern-day description of the condition in children in a lecture at Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London, in 1887. Gee acknowledged earlier descriptions and terms for the disease and adopted the same term as Aretaeus (coeliac disease). He perceptively stated: ""If the patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet."" Gee recognised that milk intolerance is a problem with coeliac children and that highly starched foods should be avoided. However, he forbade rice, sago, fruit, and vegetables, which all would have been safe to eat, and he recommended raw meat as well as thin slices of toasted bread. Gee highlighted particular success with a child ""who was fed upon a quart of the best Dutch mussels daily."" However, the child could not bear this diet for more than one season.[149][150]
 Christian Archibald Herter, an American physician, wrote a book in 1908 on children with coeliac disease, which he called ""intestinal infantilism"". He noted their growth was retarded and that fat was better tolerated than carbohydrate. The eponym Gee-Herter disease was sometimes used to acknowledge both contributions.[151][152] Sidney V. Haas, an American paediatrician, reported positive effects of a diet of bananas in 1924.[153] This diet remained in vogue until the actual cause of coeliac disease was determined.[149]
 While a role for carbohydrates had been suspected, the link with wheat was not made until the 1940s by the Dutch paediatrician Dr Willem Karel Dicke.[154] It is likely that clinical improvement of his patients during the Dutch famine of 1944 (during which flour was scarce) may have contributed to his discovery.[155] Dicke noticed that the shortage of bread led to a significant drop in the death rate among children affected by coeliac disease from greater than 35% to essentially zero. He also reported that once wheat was again available after the conflict, the mortality rate soared to previous levels.[156] The link with the gluten component of wheat was made in 1952 by a team from Birmingham, England.[157] Villous atrophy was described by British physician John W. Paulley in 1954 on samples taken at surgery.[158] This paved the way for biopsy samples taken by endoscopy.[149]
 Throughout the 1960s, other features of coeliac disease were elucidated. Its hereditary character was recognised in 1965.[159] In 1966, dermatitis herpetiformis was linked to gluten sensitivity.[149][44]
 May has been designated as ""Coeliac Awareness Month"" by several coeliac organisations.[160][161]
 Speaking generally, the various denominations of Christians celebrate a Eucharist in which a wafer or small piece of sacramental bread from wheat bread is blessed and then eaten. A typical wafer weighs about half a gram.[162] Wheat flour contains around 10–13% gluten, so a single communion wafer may have more than 50 mg of gluten, an amount that harms many people with coeliac, especially if consumed every day (see Diet above).[citation needed]
 Many Christian churches offer their communicants gluten-free alternatives, usually in the form of a rice-based cracker or gluten-free bread. These include the United Methodist, Christian Reformed, Episcopal, the Anglican Church (Church of England, UK) and Lutheran. Catholics may receive from the Chalice alone, or ask for gluten-reduced hosts; gluten-free ones however are not considered to still be wheat bread and hence invalid matter.[163]
 Roman Catholic doctrine states that for a valid Eucharist, the bread to be used at Mass must be made from wheat. Low-gluten hosts meet all of the Catholic Church's requirements, but they are not entirely gluten free. Requests to use rice wafers have been denied.[164]
 The issue is more complex for priests. As a celebrant, a priest is, for the fullness of the sacrifice of the Mass, absolutely required to receive under both species. On 24 July 2003, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated, ""Given the centrality of the celebration of the Eucharist in the life of a priest, one must proceed with great caution before admitting to Holy Orders those candidates unable to ingest gluten or alcohol without serious harm.""[165]
 By January 2004, extremely low-gluten Church-approved hosts had become available in the United States, Italy and Australia.[166] As of July 2017, the Vatican still outlawed the use of gluten-free bread for Holy Communion.[167]
 The Jewish festival of Pesach (Passover) may present problems with its obligation to eat Matzah, which is unleavened bread made in a strictly controlled manner from wheat, barley, spelt, oats, or rye.
In addition, many other grains that are normally used as substitutes for people with gluten sensitivity, including rice, are avoided altogether on Passover by Ashkenazi Jews. Many kosher-for-Passover products avoid grains altogether and are therefore gluten-free. Potato starch is the primary starch used to replace the grains.[citation needed]
 Coeliac disease is the preferred spelling in British English, while celiac disease is typically used in North American English.[168][169]
 The search for environmental factors that could be responsible for genetically susceptible people becoming intolerant to gluten has resulted in increasing research activity looking at gastrointestinal infections.[170] Research published in April 2017 suggests that an often-symptomless infection by a common strain of reovirus can increase sensitivity to foods such as gluten.[171]
 Various treatment approaches are being studied, including some that would reduce the need for dieting. All are still under development, and are not expected to be available to the general public for a while.[28][172][173]
 Three main approaches have been proposed as new therapeutic modalities for coeliac disease: gluten detoxification, modulation of the intestinal permeability, and modulation of the immune response.[174]
 Using genetically engineered wheat species, or wheat species that have been selectively bred to be minimally immunogenic, may allow the consumption of wheat. This, however, could interfere with the effects that gliadin has on the quality of dough. 
 Alternatively, gluten exposure can be minimised by the ingestion of a combination of enzymes (prolyl endopeptidase and a barley glutamine-specific cysteine endopeptidase (EP-B2)) that degrade the putative 33-mer peptide in the duodenum.[28] Latiglutenase (IMGX003) is a biotheraputic digestive enzyme therapy currently being trialled that aims to degrade gluten proteins and aid gluten digestion. It was shown to mitigate intestinal mucosal damage and reduce the severity and frequency of symptoms in phase 2 clinical trials[175] and is scheduled for phase 3 clinical trials.[176]
 Alternative treatments under investigation include the inhibition of zonulin, an endogenous signalling protein linked to increased permeability of the bowel wall and hence increased presentation of gliadin to the immune system. One inhibitor of this pathway is larazotide acetate, which is currently scheduled for phase 3 clinical trials.[177][needs update] Other modifiers of other well-understood steps in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease, such as the action of HLA-DQ2 or tissue transglutaminase and the MICA/NKG2D interaction that may be involved in the killing of enterocytes.[28]
 Attempts to modulate the immune response concerning coeliac disease are mostly still in phase I of clinical testing; one agent (CCX282-B) has been evaluated in a phase II clinical trial based on small-intestinal biopsies taken from people with coeliac disease before and after gluten exposure.[174]
 Although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism, there is no good evidence that a gluten-free diet is of benefit in the treatment of autism.[178][179][180] In the subset of autistic people who have gluten sensitivity, there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve hyperactivity and mental confusion in those with autism.[178][181][182]

"Celiac disease (celiac sprue) causes problems in your digestive system when you eat gluten, a protein found in wheat and other grains. It’s more serious than a normal food intolerance, though. Celiac disease causes your immune system to attack gluten in your small intestine. The attack damages your small intestine and stops it from working properly. Celiac disease is an inherited autoimmune disorder that causes a reaction in your body to the protein, gluten. Gluten in your digestive system triggers your immune system to produce antibodies against it. These antibodies damage the lining of your small intestine (the mucosa). Damage to the mucosa in your small intestine impairs its ability to absorb nutrients from your food, causing nutritional deficiencies. Gluten is a protein found in grains — particularly wheat, barley and rye. These grains, especially wheat, make up many of the staple foods of the standard Western diet, from breads and cereals to pasta and baked goods. Besides that, gluten often appears as an additive in food products where you wouldn’t expect to find it, such as sauces, soups and packaged foods. Beer is usually made from barley or rye. Celiac disease affects your small intestine. This is where most of the nutrients from your food are absorbed, including proteins like gluten. But when you have celiac disease, gluten in your small intestine triggers an immune response. Your immune system sends inflammatory cells and antibodies to destroy the gluten molecules. These cells damage the mucous membrane lining your small intestine (mucosa). The mucosa that lines your small intestine is vast but is scrunched up into many folds and fingerlike projections called villi. If you stretched it all out, it would cover a tennis court. The folds and projections increase the surface area in order to absorb as many nutrients as possible during digestion. But immune cells triggered by celiac disease erode and flatten these projections, diminishing the surface area. Damage to your small intestine can have serious consequences. Your small intestine absorbs nutrients from your food through the mucosa. If the mucosa is damaged, it won’t be able to absorb nutrients as it should. This is called malabsorption. It can lead to malnutrition and to many other conditions that follow from the lack of different nutrients. In children, it can cause stunted growth and development. Celiac disease is most commonly found in people of Northern European descent. It’s estimated to affect 1% of the populations of Europe and North America. You have a 10% chance of developing the disease if you have a first-degree relative, such as a parent or child, who has it. About 97% of people diagnosed with celiac disease have a recognizable gene mutation associated with it (HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8). Celiac disease is more common in people with certain inherited chromosomal disorders, such as Down syndrome. It’s also more common in people with certain other autoimmune diseases. These diseases often share common genes, and they also have a way of triggering each other. Like other autoimmune diseases, celiac disease is more common in people assigned female at birth (AFAB). The ratio is at least 2:1. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Many autoimmune diseases, like celiac disease, are at least partly inherited (genetic disorders). That means a particular gene mutation that’s passed down through family lines makes you more susceptible to developing it. But not everyone with the gene mutation develops the disease, and not everyone who develops it has one of the known genes. Other factors appear to be involved in triggering it. One theory is that it’s triggered by some type of significant physical stress that overextends your immune system. Healthcare providers have observed that the disease often shows up after a physical event such as surgery, illness or pregnancy, or a severe emotional event. Another theory is that microorganisms living in your gut are involved. More research is needed to explore these theories. Celiac disease can appear at any age after you or your child has begun eating gluten. Healthcare providers most commonly see it appear during two distinct age windows: early childhood, between 8 and 12 months old, and mid-life, between the ages of 40 and 60. The window in early childhood is typically when children begin eating solid foods that may include biscuits or cereals with gluten in them. Symptoms of celiac disease vary widely among people, which can make it hard to recognize. Some people don’t notice any symptoms at all. Some experience indigestion and other gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms after eating gluten. Some only have vague symptoms of nutritional deficiencies later on, when real damage has been done. In these people, symptoms of anemia may be the first to present. You might have: Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as: Symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia, such as: Other symptoms of malnutrition, such as: Dermatitis herpetiformis: About 15% of people with celiac disease develop this chronic skin condition as a side effect. Also called the “gluten rash” or the “celiac rash,” the same gluten antibodies that damage your small intestine in celiac disease cause this condition. Dermatitis herpetiformis manifests as an itchy rash that looks like clusters of bumps or blisters. It typically affects your elbows, knees, buttocks or scalp. Advertisement You might suspect you have celiac disease if you have gastrointestinal symptoms after eating gluten. Many people appear to have a sensitivity to gluten or wheat products in their diet. Food intolerances can cause uncomfortable symptoms after eating, but they don’t damage your intestines the way celiac disease does. To diagnose celiac disease, healthcare providers will look for evidence of this damage. It’s important to get tested for celiac disease before you try a gluten-free diet, so the tests can reveal how gluten actually affects your body. Once you begin avoiding gluten, your gut will begin to heal. Healing is good, but it’ll erase the evidence of celiac disease. You and your healthcare provider need to know for sure if you have it in order to know what kind of care you’ll need going forward. Healthcare providers use two methods of testing for celiac disease. They prefer to use both together to confirm the diagnosis. The first method is blood testing. Providers test a sample of your blood for the gluten antibodies that damage your intestines. Then, they’ll look for the damage itself. This requires taking a small tissue sample from your small intestine (biopsy) to examine under a microscope. To take the sample, a gastroenterologist will perform an endoscopic exam of your small intestine. Endoscopic procedures involve passing a tiny camera through your body on the end of a long, thin catheter. An upper endoscopy passes the endoscope down your throat into the first part of your small intestine. Guided by the camera, the endoscopist can pass tools through the catheter to take a biopsy. After confirming celiac disease, your provider will want to test your blood for specific vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Severe deficiencies can have wide-ranging effects on your body and may need to be treated directly with supplements. Common findings include iron-deficiency anemia, vitamin-deficiency anemia and vitamin D deficiency. You may also be low in electrolytes, such as calcium. Advertisement The first and most important step in treating celiac disease is to stop eating gluten. You can’t change the way your body reacts to gluten, but you can prevent gluten from triggering that reaction. When you stop eating gluten, your small intestine will begin to heal and will soon be able to absorb nutrients again. You have to maintain a strict gluten-free diet for life, though, to avoid hurting your small intestine again. Additional treatment may include: Most people find their symptoms begin to improve almost immediately after starting a gluten-free diet. It may take several weeks to replace your nutritional deficiencies and several months for your gut to fully heal. It can take longer in some cases, depending on the extent of the damage and how long it’s been going on. You can also prevent your body from healing if you aren’t strict with your diet. Most people who’ve been diagnosed and have stopped eating gluten have an excellent prognosis. Most of the damage done by celiac disease can be undone. If you continue to have symptoms, it may be that you’re consuming small amounts of gluten without realizing it, or you may have a secondary condition. Only 5% of people have truly refractory celiac disease that doesn’t respond to diet. If you go many years before being diagnosed or you don’t succeed in avoiding gluten afterward, the effects of celiac disease can be more severe and long-lasting. Malnutrition can affect your nervous system and skeletal system and some of these effects are hard to reverse, especially when they occur during childhood development. Chronic inflammation can also lead to other problems in your intestine. Complications of chronic malnutrition can include: Complications of chronic inflammation can include: Avoiding gluten in all its forms can be daunting at first. You’ll have to learn to read labels carefully and watch out for accidental contamination. The good news is that there’s an abundance of resources available to help you navigate your new diet. Your healthcare provider will refer you to a registered dietitian to get you started. There are also many dedicated support groups and references online. Gluten is found naturally in certain grains and products made from grains, including: These grains are used to make: It’s also added to many processed food products, such as: Make sure to check labels for hidden gluten before eating processed foods. A note from Cleveland Clinic A celiac disease diagnosis will change your diet and lifestyle forever. It’ll also change your life for the better. Before diagnosis, you were almost certainly eating gluten and doing progressive damage to your small intestine. You may have had strange and uncomfortable symptoms for years without knowing why. Now that you know, the power’s in your hands to restore your health. Last reviewed on 12/01/2022. Learn more about our editorial process.

"Chagas (CHAH-gus) disease is an inflammatory, infectious disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite is found in the feces of the triatomine (reduviid) bug. This bug is also known as the ""kissing bug."" Chagas disease is common in South America, Central America and Mexico, the primary home of the triatomine bug. Rare cases of Chagas disease have also been found in the southern United States. Also called American trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease can infect anyone. Left untreated, Chagas disease later can cause serious heart and digestive problems. During the acute phase of infection, treatment of Chagas disease focuses on killing the parasite. In people who have chronic Chagas disease, it's no longer possible to kill the parasite. Treatment in this later phase is about managing signs and symptoms. You can also take steps to prevent infection. Chagas disease can cause a sudden, brief illness (acute), or it may be a long-lasting (chronic) condition. Symptoms range from mild to severe, although many people don't experience symptoms until the chronic stage. The acute phase of Chagas disease, which lasts for weeks or months, is often symptom-free. When signs and symptoms do occur, they are usually mild and may include: Signs and symptoms that develop during the acute phase usually go away on their own. In some cases, if the infection isn't treated, Chagas disease will advance to the chronic phase. Signs and symptoms of the chronic phase of Chagas disease may occur 10 to 20 years after initial infection, or they may never occur. In severe cases, Chagas disease signs and symptoms may include: See your doctor if you live in or have traveled to an area where Chagas disease is widespread and you have signs and symptoms of the condition. Symptoms may include swelling at the infection site, fever, fatigue, body aches, rash and nausea. The cause of Chagas disease is the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is spread from an insect known as the triatomine bug, or ""kissing bug."" These insects can become infected by this parasite when they swallow blood from an animal that is infected with the parasite. Triatomine bugs live primarily in mud, thatch or adobe huts in Mexico, South America and Central America. They hide in crevices in the walls or roof during the day and come out at night — often feeding on sleeping humans. Infected bugs defecate after feeding, leaving behind parasites on the skin. The parasites can then enter your body through your eyes, mouth, a cut or scratch, or the wound from the bug's bite. Scratching or rubbing the bite site helps the parasites enter your body. Once in your body, the parasites multiply and spread. You may also become infected by: The following factors may increase your risk of getting Chagas disease: It's rare for travelers to the at-risk areas in South America, Central America and Mexico to catch Chagas disease because travelers tend to stay in well-constructed buildings, such as hotels. Triatomine bugs are usually found in structures built with mud or adobe or thatch. If Chagas disease progresses to the long-lasting (chronic) phase, serious heart or digestive complications may occur. These may include: If you live in a high-risk area for Chagas disease, these steps can help you prevent infection: Nov 12, 2020 CON-XXXXXXXX Mayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products.

 Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. It is spread mostly by insects in the subfamily Triatominae, known as ""kissing bugs"". The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or swelling at the site of the bite.[1] After four to eight weeks, untreated individuals enter the chronic phase of disease, which in most cases does not result in further symptoms.[2][4] Up to 45% of people with chronic infections develop heart disease 10–30 years after the initial illness, which can lead to heart failure. Digestive complications, including an enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon, may also occur in up to 21% of people, and up to 10% of people may experience nerve damage.[2]
 T. cruzi is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the kissing bug's bite wound and the bug's infected feces.[5] The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, consuming food or drink contaminated with the parasites, and vertical transmission (from a mother to her baby).[1] Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope or detecting its DNA by polymerase chain reaction.[4] Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for T. cruzi in the blood.[6]
 Prevention focuses on eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites.[1] This may involve the use of insecticides or bed-nets.[7] Other preventive efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. Early infections are treatable with the medications benznidazole or nifurtimox, which usually cure the disease if given shortly after the person is infected, but become less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of end-stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox often cause side effects, including skin disorders, digestive system irritation, and neurological symptoms, which can result in treatment being discontinued.[2][8] New drugs for Chagas disease are under development,[9] and while experimental vaccines have been studied in animal models,[10][11] a human vaccine has not been developed. 
 It is estimated that 6.5 million people, mostly in Mexico, Central America and South America, have Chagas disease as of 2019,[1][3] resulting in approximately 9,490 annual deaths.[3] Most people with the disease are poor,[12] and most do not realize they are infected.[13] Large-scale population migrations have carried Chagas disease to new regions, which include the United States and many European countries.[1] The disease affects more than 150 types of animals.[14]
 The disease was first described in 1909 by Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, after whom it is named.[1] Chagas disease is classified as a neglected tropical disease.[15]
 Chagas disease occurs in two stages: an acute stage, which develops one to two weeks after the insect bite, and a chronic stage, which develops over many years.[2][4][16] The acute stage is often symptom-free.[2] When present, the symptoms are typically minor and not specific to any particular disease.[4] Signs and symptoms include fever, malaise, headache, and enlargement of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes.[1][2][4] Sometimes, people develop a swollen nodule at the site of infection, which is called ""Romaña's sign"" if it is on the eyelid, or a ""chagoma"" if it is elsewhere on the skin.[4][17] In rare cases (less than 1–5%), infected individuals develop severe acute disease, which can involve inflammation of the heart muscle, fluid accumulation around the heart, and inflammation of the brain and surrounding tissues, and may be life-threatening. The acute phase typically lasts four to eight weeks and resolves without treatment.[2]
 Unless treated with antiparasitic drugs, individuals remain infected with T. cruzi after recovering from the acute phase. Most chronic infections are asymptomatic, which is referred to as indeterminate chronic Chagas disease. However, over decades with the disease, approximately 30–40% of people develop organ dysfunction (determinate chronic Chagas disease), which most often affects the heart or digestive system.[2][4]
 The most common long-term manifestation is heart disease, which occurs in 14–45% of people with chronic Chagas disease.[2] People with Chagas heart disease often experience heart palpitations, and sometimes fainting, due to irregular heart function. By electrocardiogram, people with Chagas heart disease most frequently have arrhythmias. As the disease progresses, the heart's ventricles become enlarged (dilated cardiomyopathy), which reduces its ability to pump blood. In many cases the first sign of Chagas heart disease is heart failure, thromboembolism, or chest pain associated with abnormalities in the microvasculature.[18]
 Also common in chronic Chagas disease is damage to the digestive system, which affects 10–21% of people.[2] Enlargement of the esophagus or colon are the most common digestive issues.[16] Those with enlarged esophagus often experience pain (odynophagia) or trouble swallowing (dysphagia), acid reflux, cough, and weight loss. Individuals with enlarged colon often experience constipation, and may develop severe blockage of the intestine or its blood supply. Up to 10% of chronically infected individuals develop nerve damage that can result in numbness and altered reflexes or movement.[2] While chronic disease typically develops over decades, some individuals with Chagas disease (less than 10%) progress to heart damage directly after acute disease.[18]
 Signs and symptoms differ for people infected with T. cruzi through less common routes. People infected through ingestion of parasites tend to develop severe disease within three weeks of consumption, with symptoms including fever, vomiting, shortness of breath, cough, and pain in the chest, abdomen, and muscles.[2] Those infected congenitally typically have few to no symptoms, but can have mild non-specific symptoms, or severe symptoms such as jaundice, respiratory distress, and heart problems.[2] People infected through organ transplant or blood transfusion tend to have symptoms similar to those of vector-borne disease, but the symptoms may not manifest for anywhere from a week to five months.[2] Chronically infected individuals who become immunosuppressed due to HIV infection can have particularly severe and distinct disease, most commonly characterized by inflammation in the brain and surrounding tissue or brain abscesses.[4] Symptoms vary widely based on the size and location of brain abscesses, but typically include fever, headaches, seizures, loss of sensation, or other neurological issues that indicate particular sites of nervous system damage.[19] Occasionally, these individuals also experience acute heart inflammation, skin lesions, and disease of the stomach, intestine, or peritoneum.[4]
 Chagas disease is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite T. cruzi, which is typically introduced into humans through the bite of triatomine bugs, also called ""kissing bugs"".[4] When the insect defecates at the bite site, motile T. cruzi forms called trypomastigotes enter the bloodstream and invade various host cells.[5] Inside a host cell, the parasite transforms into a replicative form called an amastigote, which undergoes several rounds of replication.[5] The replicated amastigotes transform back into trypomastigotes, which burst the host cell and are released into the bloodstream.[2] Trypomastigotes then disseminate throughout the body to various tissues, where they invade cells and replicate.[2] Over many years, cycles of parasite replication and immune response can severely damage these tissues, particularly the heart and digestive tract.[2]
 T. cruzi can be transmitted by various triatomine bugs in the genera Triatoma, Panstrongylus, and Rhodnius.[2] The primary vectors for human infection are the species of triatomine bugs that inhabit human dwellings, namely Triatoma infestans, Rhodnius prolixus, Triatoma dimidiata and Panstrongylus megistus.[20] These insects are known by a number of local names, including vinchuca in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, barbeiro (the barber) in Brazil, pito in Colombia, chinche in Central America, and chipo in Venezuela.[21] The bugs tend to feed at night, preferring moist surfaces near the eyes or mouth.[16][20] A triatomine bug can become infected with T. cruzi when it feeds on an infected host.[16] T. cruzi replicates in the insect's intestinal tract and is shed in the bug's feces.[16] When an infected triatomine feeds, it pierces the skin and takes in a blood meal, defecating at the same time to make room for the new meal.[16] The bite is typically painless, but causes itching.[16] Scratching at the bite introduces the T. cruzi-laden feces into the bite wound, initiating infection.[16]
 In addition to classical vector spread, Chagas disease can be transmitted through consumption of food or drink contaminated with triatomine insects or their feces.[22] Since heating or drying kills the parasites, drinks and especially fruit juices are the most frequent source of infection.[22] This oral route of transmission has been implicated in several outbreaks, where it led to unusually severe symptoms, likely due to infection with a higher parasite load than from the bite of a triatomine bug—[6][22]a single crushed triatomine in a food or beverage harboring T cruzi can contain about 600,000 metacyclic trypomastigotes, while triatomine fecal matter contains 3,000-4,000 per μL.[23]
 T. cruzi can be transmitted independent of the triatomine bug during blood transfusion, following organ transplantation, or across the placenta during pregnancy.[2] Transfusion with the blood of an infected donor infects the recipient 10–25% of the time.[2] To prevent this, blood donations are screened for T. cruzi in many countries with endemic Chagas disease, as well as the United States.[6] Similarly, transplantation of solid organs from an infected donor can transmit T. cruzi to the recipient.[2] This is especially true for heart transplant, which transmits T. cruzi 75–100% of the time, and less so for transplantation of the liver (0–29%) or a kidney (0–19%).[2] An infected mother can pass T. cruzi to her child through the placenta; this occurs in up to 15% of births by infected mothers.[24] As of 2019, 22.5% of new infections occurred through congenital transmission.[25]
 In the acute phase of the disease, signs and symptoms are caused directly by the replication of T. cruzi and the immune system's response to it.[2] During this phase, T. cruzi can be found in various tissues throughout the body and circulating in the blood.[2] During the initial weeks of infection, parasite replication is brought under control by production of antibodies and activation of the host's inflammatory response, particularly cells that target intracellular pathogens such as NK cells and macrophages, driven by inflammation-signaling molecules like TNF-α and IFN-γ.[2]
 During chronic Chagas disease, long-term organ damage develops over years due to continued replication of the parasite and damage from the immune system. Early in the course of the disease, T. cruzi is found frequently in the striated muscle fibers of the heart.[26] As disease progresses, the heart becomes generally enlarged, with substantial regions of cardiac muscle fiber replaced by scar tissue and fat.[26] Areas of active inflammation are scattered throughout the heart, with each housing inflammatory immune cells, typically macrophages and T cells.[26] Late in the disease, parasites are rarely detected in the heart, and may be present at only very low levels.[26]
 In the heart, colon, and esophagus, chronic disease leads to a massive loss of nerve endings.[18] In the heart, this may contribute to arrythmias and other cardiac dysfunction.[18] In the colon and esophagus, loss of nervous system control is the major driver of organ dysfunction.[18] Loss of nerves impairs the movement of food through the digestive tract, which can lead to blockage of the esophagus or colon and restriction of their blood supply.[18]
 The presence of T. cruzi in the blood is diagnostic of Chagas disease. During the acute phase of infection, it can be detected by microscopic examination of fresh anticoagulated blood, or its buffy coat, for motile parasites; or by preparation of thin and thick blood smears stained with Giemsa, for direct visualization of parasites.[4][6] Blood smear examination detects parasites in 34–85% of cases. The sensitivity increases if techniques such as microhematocrit centrifugation are used to concentrate the blood.[2] On microscopic examination of stained blood smears, T. cruzi trypomastigotes appear as S or U-shaped organisms with a flagellum connected to the body by an undulating membrane. A nucleus and a smaller structure called a kinetoplast are visible inside the parasite's body; the kinetoplast of T. cruzi is relatively large, which helps to distinguish it from other species of trypanosomes that infect humans.[27]
 Alternatively, T. cruzi DNA can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In acute and congenital Chagas disease, PCR is more sensitive than microscopy,[25] and it is more reliable than antibody-based tests for the diagnosis of congenital disease because it is not affected by transfer of antibodies against T. cruzi from a mother to her baby (passive immunity).[28] PCR is also used to monitor T. cruzi levels in organ transplant recipients and immunosuppressed people, which allows infection or reactivation to be detected at an early stage.[2][4][25]
 In chronic Chagas disease, the concentration of parasites in the blood is too low to be reliably detected by microscopy or PCR,[2] so the diagnosis is usually made using serological tests, which detect immunoglobulin G antibodies against T. cruzi in the blood.[6] Two positive serology results, using different test methods, are required to confirm the diagnosis.[4] If the test results are inconclusive, additional testing methods such as Western blot can be used.[2]
 Various rapid diagnostic tests for Chagas disease are available. These tests are easily transported and can be performed by people without special training.[29] They are useful for screening large numbers of people and testing people who cannot access healthcare facilities, but their sensitivity is relatively low,[2] and it is recommended that a second method is used to confirm a positive result.[29][30]
 T. cruzi parasites can be grown from blood samples by blood culture, xenodiagnosis, or by inoculating animals with the person's blood. In the blood culture method, the person's red blood cells are separated from the plasma and added to a specialized growth medium to encourage multiplication of the parasite. It can take up to six months to obtain the result. Xenodiagnosis involves feeding the blood to triatomine insects, then examining their feces for the parasite 30 to 60 days later.[29] These methods are not routinely used, as they are slow and have low sensitivity.[31][29]
 Efforts to prevent Chagas disease have largely focused on vector control to limit exposure to triatomine bugs. Insecticide-spraying programs have been the mainstay of vector control, consisting of spraying homes and the surrounding areas with residual insecticides.[32] This was originally done with organochlorine, organophosphate, and carbamate insecticides, which were supplanted in the 1980s with pyrethroids.[32] These programs have drastically reduced transmission in Brazil and Chile,[16] and eliminated major vectors from certain regions: Triatoma infestans from Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and parts of Peru and Paraguay, as well as Rhodnius prolixus from Central America.[18] Vector control in some regions has been hindered by the development of insecticide resistance among triatomine bugs.[32] In response, vector control programs have implemented alternative insecticides (e.g. fenitrothion and bendiocarb in Argentina and Bolivia), treatment of domesticated animals (which are also fed on by triatomine bugs) with pesticides, pesticide-impregnated paints, and other experimental approaches.[32] In areas with triatomine bugs, transmission of T. cruzi can be prevented by sleeping under bed nets and by housing improvements that prevent triatomine bugs from colonizing houses.[16]
 Blood transfusion was formerly the second-most common mode of transmission for Chagas disease.[33] T. cruzi can survive in refrigerated stored blood, and can survive freezing and thawing, allowing it to persist in whole blood, packed red blood cells, granulocytes, cryoprecipitate, and platelets.[33] The development and implementation of blood bank screening tests has dramatically reduced the risk of infection during blood transfusion.[33] Nearly all blood donations in Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening.[33] Widespread screening is also common in non-endemic nations with significant populations of immigrants from endemic areas, including the United Kingdom (implemented in 1999), Spain (2005), the United States (2007), France and Sweden (2009), Switzerland (2012), and Belgium (2013).[34] Serological tests, typically ELISAs, are used to detect antibodies against T. cruzi proteins in donor blood.[33]
 Other modes of transmission have been targeted by Chagas disease prevention programs. Treating T. cruzi-infected mothers during pregnancy reduces the risk of congenital transmission of the infection.[24] To this end, many countries in Latin America have implemented routine screening of pregnant women and infants for T. cruzi infection, and the World Health Organization recommends screening all children born to infected mothers to prevent congenital infection from developing into chronic disease.[1][35] Similarly to blood transfusions, many countries with endemic Chagas disease screen organs for transplantation with serological tests.[2]
 There is no vaccine against Chagas disease.[8] Several experimental vaccines have been tested in animals infected with T. cruzi and were able to reduce parasite numbers in the blood and heart,[36] but no vaccine candidates had undergone clinical trials in humans as of 2016.[37]
 Chagas disease is managed using antiparasitic drugs to eliminate T. cruzi from the body, and symptomatic treatment to address the effects of the infection.[6] As of 2018, benznidazole and nifurtimox were the antiparasitic drugs of choice for treating Chagas disease,[2] though benznidazole is the only drug available in most of Latin America.[38] For either drug, treatment typically consists of two to three oral doses per day for 60 to 90 days.[2] Antiparasitic treatment is most effective early in the course of infection: it eliminates T. cruzi from 50 to 80% of people in the acute phase (WHO: ""nearly 100 %""[39]), but only 20–60% of those in the chronic phase.[6] Treatment of chronic disease is more effective in children than in adults, and the cure rate for congenital disease approaches 100% if treated in the first year of life.[2] Antiparasitic treatment can also slow the progression of the disease and reduce the possibility of congenital transmission.[1] Elimination of T. cruzi does not cure the cardiac and gastrointestinal damage caused by chronic Chagas disease, so these conditions must be treated separately.[6] Antiparasitic treatment is not recommended for people who have already developed dilated cardiomyopathy.[18]
 Benznidazole is usually considered the first-line treatment because it has milder adverse effects than nifurtimox, and its efficacy is better understood.[2][25] Both benznidazole and nifurtimox have common side effects that can result in treatment being discontinued. The most common side effects of benznidazole are skin rash, digestive problems, decreased appetite, weakness, headache, and sleeping problems. These side effects can sometimes be treated with antihistamines or corticosteroids, and are generally reversed when treatment is stopped.[2] However, benznidazole is discontinued in up to 29% of cases.[2] Nifurtimox has more frequent side effects, affecting up to 97.5% of individuals taking the drug.[2] The most common side effects are loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, and various neurological disorders including mood changes, insomnia, paresthesia and peripheral neuropathy.[2] Treatment is discontinued in up to 75% of cases.[2][25] Both drugs are contraindicated for use in pregnant women and people with liver or kidney failure.[1] As of 2019, resistance to these drugs has been reported.[38]
 In the chronic stage, treatment involves managing the clinical manifestations of the disease. The treatment of Chagas cardiomyopathy is similar to that of other forms of heart disease.[2] Beta blockers and ACE inhibitors may be prescribed, but some people with Chagas disease may not be able to take the standard dose of these drugs because they have low blood pressure or a low heart rate.[2][18] To manage irregular heartbeats, people may be prescribed anti-arrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, or have a pacemaker implanted.[4] Blood thinners may be used to prevent thromboembolism and stroke.[18] Chronic heart disease caused by untreated T. cruzi  infection is a common reason for heart transplantation surgery.[16] Because transplant recipients take immunosuppressive drugs to prevent organ rejection, they are monitored using PCR to detect reactivation of the disease. People with Chagas disease who undergo heart transplantation have higher survival rates than the average heart transplant recipient.[18]
 Mild gastrointestinal disease may be treated symptomatically, such as by using laxatives for constipation, or taking a prokinetic drug like metoclopramide before meals to relieve esophageal symptoms.[4][40] Surgery to sever the muscles of the lower esophageal sphincter (cardiomyotomy) may be performed in more severe cases of esophageal disease,[40] and surgical removal of the affected part of the organ may be required for advanced megacolon and megaesophagus.[4][31]
 In 2019, an estimated 6.5 million people worldwide had Chagas disease, with approximately 173,000 new infections and 9,490 deaths each year.[3] The disease resulted in a global annual economic burden estimated at US$7.2 billion in 2013, 86% of which is borne by endemic countries.[34][43] Chagas disease results in the loss of over 800,000 disability-adjusted life years each year.[2]
 The endemic area of Chagas disease stretches from the southern United States to northern Chile and Argentina, with Bolivia (6.1%), Argentina (3.6%), and Paraguay (2.1%) exhibiting the highest prevalence of the disease.[2] Within continental Latin America, Chagas disease is endemic to 21 countries: Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela.[1][2] In endemic areas, due largely to vector control efforts and screening of blood donations, annual infections and deaths have fallen by 67% and more than 73% respectively from their peaks in the 1980s to 2010.[2][44] Transmission by insect vector and blood transfusion has been completely interrupted in Uruguay (1997), Chile (1999), and Brazil (2006),[44] and in Argentina, vectorial transmission had been interrupted in 13 of the 19 endemic provinces as of 2001.[45] During Venezuela's humanitarian crisis, vectorial transmission has begun occurring in areas where it had previously been interrupted, and Chagas disease seroprevalence rates have increased.[46] Transmission rates have also risen in the Gran Chaco region due to insecticide resistance and in the Amazon basin due to oral transmission.[2]
 While the rate of vector-transmitted Chagas disease has declined throughout most of Latin America, the rate of orally transmitted disease has risen, possibly due to increasing urbanization and deforestation bringing people into closer contact with triatomines and altering the distribution of triatomine species.[22][47][48] Orally transmitted Chagas disease is of particular concern in Venezuela, where 16 outbreaks have been recorded between 2007 and 2018.[46]
 Chagas exists in two different ecological zones. In the Southern Cone region, the main vector lives in and around human homes. In Central America and Mexico, the main vector species lives both inside dwellings and in uninhabited areas. In both zones, Chagas occurs almost exclusively in rural areas, where T. cruzi also circulates in wild and domestic animals.[49] T. cruzi commonly infects more than 100 species of mammals across Latin America including opossums (Didelphis spp.),[50] armadillos, marmosets, bats, various rodents[51] and dogs[50] all of which can be infected by the vectors or orally by eating triatomine bugs and other infected animals.[51][50] For entomophagous animals this is a common mode.[50] Didelphis spp. are unique in that they do not require the triatomine for transmission, completing the life cycle through their own urine and feces.[50] Veterinary transmission also occurs through vertical transmission through the placenta, blood transfusion and organ transplants.[50]
 Though Chagas is traditionally considered a disease of rural Latin America, international migration has dispersed those with the disease to numerous non-endemic countries, primarily in North America and Europe.[1][34] As of 2020, approximately 300,000 infected people are living in the United States,[52] and in 2018 it was estimated that 30,000 to 40,000 people in the United States had Chagas cardiomyopathy.[18] The vast majority of cases in the United States occur in immigrants from Latin America,[18][25] but local transmission is possible. Eleven triatomine species are native to the United States, and some southern states have persistent cycles of disease transmission between insect vectors and animal reservoirs,[2][25] which include woodrats, possums, raccoons, armadillos and skunks.[53] However, locally acquired infection is very rare: only 28 cases were documented from 1955 to 2015.[2][52] As of 2013, the cost of treatment in the United States was estimated to be US$900 million annually (global cost $7 billion), which included hospitalization and medical devices such as pacemakers.[43]
 Chagas disease affected approximately 68,000 to 123,000 people in Europe as of 2019.[54] Spain, which has a high rate of immigration from Latin America, has the highest prevalence of the disease. It is estimated that 50,000 to 70,000 people in Spain are living with Chagas disease, accounting for the majority of European cases.[55] The prevalence varies widely within European countries due to differing immigration patterns.[54] Italy has the second highest prevalence, followed by the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Germany.[55]
 T. cruzi likely circulated in South American mammals long before the arrival of humans on the continent.[56] T. cruzi has been detected in ancient human remains across South America, from a 9000-year-old Chinchorro mummy in the Atacama Desert, to remains of various ages in Minas Gerais, to an 1100-year-old mummy as far north as the Chihuahuan Desert near the Rio Grande.[56] Many early written accounts describe symptoms consistent with Chagas disease, with early descriptions of the disease sometimes attributed to Miguel Diaz Pimenta (1707), Luís Gomes Ferreira [pt] (1735), and Theodoro J. H. Langgaard (1842).[56]
 The formal description of Chagas disease was made by Carlos Chagas in 1909 after examining a two-year-old girl with fever, swollen lymph nodes, and an enlarged spleen and liver.[56] Upon examination of her blood, Chagas saw trypanosomes identical to those he had recently identified from the hindgut of triatomine bugs and named Trypanosoma cruzi in honor of his mentor, Brazilian physician Oswaldo Cruz.[56] He sent infected triatomine bugs to Cruz in Rio de Janeiro, who showed the bite of the infected triatomine could transmit T. cruzi to marmoset monkeys as well.[56] In just two years, 1908 and 1909, Chagas published descriptions of the disease, the organism that caused it, and the insect vector required for infection.[57][58][59] Almost immediately thereafter, at the suggestion of Miguel Couto, then professor of the Faculdade de Medicina do Rio de Janeiro [pt], the disease was widely referred to as ""Chagas disease"".[57] Chagas' discovery brought him national and international renown, but in highlighting the inadequacies of the Brazilian government's response to the disease, Chagas attracted criticism to himself and to the disease that bore his name, stifling research on his discovery and likely frustrating his nomination for the Nobel Prize in 1921.[57][60]
 In the 1930s, Salvador Mazza rekindled Chagas disease research, describing over a thousand cases in Argentina's Chaco Province.[56] In Argentina, the disease is known as mal de Chagas-Mazza in his honor.[61] Serological tests for Chagas disease were introduced in the 1940s, demonstrating that infection with T. cruzi was widespread across Latin America.[56] This, combined with successes eliminating the malaria vector through insecticide use, spurred the creation of public health campaigns focused on treating houses with insecticides to eradicate triatomine bugs.[32][56] The 1950s saw the discovery that treating blood with crystal violet could eradicate the parasite, leading to its widespread use in transfusion screening programs in Latin America.[56] Large-scale control programs began to take form in the 1960s, first in São Paulo, then various locations in Argentina, then national-level programs across Latin America.[62] These programs received a major boost in the 1980s with the introduction of pyrethroid insecticides, which did not leave stains or odors after application and were longer-lasting and more cost-effective.[56][62] Regional bodies dedicated to controlling Chagas disease arose through support of the Pan American Health Organization, with the Initiative of the Southern Cone for the Elimination of Chagas Diseases launching in 1991, followed by the Initiative of the Andean countries (1997), Initiative of the Central American countries (1997), and the Initiative of the Amazon countries (2004).[32]
 Fexinidazole, an antiparasitic drug approved for treating African trypanosomiasis, has shown activity against Chagas disease in animal models. As of 2019, it is undergoing phase II clinical trials for chronic Chagas disease in Spain.[38][63] Other drug candidates include GNF6702, a proteasome inhibitor that is effective against Chagas disease in mice and is undergoing preliminary toxicity studies, and AN4169, which has had promising results in animal models.[11][64]
 A number of experimental vaccines have been tested in animals. In addition to subunit vaccines, some approaches have involved vaccination with attenuated T. cruzi parasites or organisms that express some of the same antigens as T. cruzi but do not cause human disease, such as Trypanosoma rangeli or Phytomonas serpens. DNA vaccination has also been explored. As of 2019, vaccine research has mainly been limited to small animal models.[10]
 As of 2018, standard diagnostic tests for Chagas disease were limited in their ability to measure the effectiveness of antiparasitic treatment, as serological tests may remain positive for years after T. cruzi is eliminated from the body, and PCR may give false-negative results when the parasite concentration in the blood is low. Several potential biomarkers of treatment response are under investigation, such as immunoassays against specific T. cruzi antigens, flow cytometry testing to detect antibodies against different life stages of T. cruzi, and markers of physiological changes caused by the parasite, such as alterations in coagulation and lipid metabolism.[18]
 Another research area is the use of biomarkers to predict the progression of chronic disease. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, brain and atrial natriuretic peptide, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 have been studied as indicators of the prognosis of Chagas cardiomyopathy.[65]
 T. cruzi shed acute-phase antigen (SAPA), which can be detected in blood using ELISA or Western blot,[24] has been used as an indicator of early acute and congenital infection.[65] An assay for T. cruzi antigens in urine has been developed to diagnose congenital disease.[24]

"Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. An estimated 6 to 7 million people worldwide are  infected with T. cruzi. Chagas disease is found mainly in endemic areas of 21 continental Latin American countries, where it is mostly transmitted when humans come into contact with faeces and/or urine of infected blood-sucking triatomine bugs (vector-borne transmission). Chagas disease was once entirely confined to the Region of the Americas. In the last decades the epidemiological pattern of the disease  changed from a rural to a mostly urban disease, mainly due to population mobility, urbanization and emigration. As a consequence, increased  number of cases have been detected in Canada and the United States of America, and in many European and some African, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific countries. Due to the high number of people who remain undiagnosed or untreated, combined with the areas with remaining active transmission, put an estimated 75 million people at risk of infection. Triatomine bugs typically live in the wall or roof cracks of poorly constructed homes in rural or suburban areas, becoming active at night, biting exposed areas of skin, then defecating close to the bite. The parasites enter the body when: i) the person inadvertently smears the bug’s waste into the bite or another skin break, the eyes or the mouth; ii) by consumption of food that has been contaminated with waste from infected triatomine bugs, typically infecting groups of people (causing outbreaks or oral transmission) with a higher frequency of severe disease and number of deaths. Everywhere Chagas disease can be also transmitted through blood or blood product transfusion from infected donors; by congenital (mother to child) transmission during pregnancy or childbirth; by organ transplantation from infected donors; and also by laboratory accidents. In May 2019, following up on decision of the 72nd World Health Assembly, the World Chagas Disease Day was established to be celebrated on 14 April (the date of the year 1909 when Carlos Chagas diagnosed the first human case of the disease, a two-year-old girl called Berenice).  After the infection is transmitted there is an initial, acute phase that lasts for about two months. In most cases, symptoms are absent or mild and unspecific. In people bitten by a triatomine bug, characteristic first visible signs of infection, such as a skin lesion or a purplish swelling of the lids of one eye (the so-called Romaña sign), can help in the diagnosis of new cases. With any transmission route, patients can present fever, headache, enlarged lymph glands, pallor, muscle pain, difficulty in breathing, swelling, and abdominal or chest pain. During the chronic phase that succeeds the acute phase, up to 30% of patients suffer from cardiac disorders and up to 10% experience digestive, neurological or mixed disorders. In later years, the infection can lead to sudden death principally due to heart arrhythmia or heart failure caused by the destruction of the heart muscle and its nervous system.   Chagas disease can be treated with two antiparasitic medicines: benznidazole and nifurtimox. Both medicines are nearly 100% effective in curing the disease if given soon after infection, including the cases of congenital transmission. The efficacy of both diminishes, however, the longer a person has been infected and the adverse reactions are more frequent at older age. Treatment is also indicated for those in whom the infection has been reactivated due to immunosuppression, and for patients during the early chronic phase. Infected adults, especially those with no symptoms, should be offered treatment because antiparasitic treatment can also prevent or curb disease progression and prevent congenital transmission in pregnant women. In other cases the potential benefits of medication in preventing or delaying the development of Chagas disease should be weighed against the duration of treatment (up to 2 months) and possible adverse reactions (occurring in up to 40% of treated adult patients). Benznidazole and nifurtimox should not be taken by pregnant women or by people with kidney or liver failure. Nifurtimox is also contraindicated for people with a background of neurological or psychiatric disorders. Additionally, specific treatment for cardiac, or digestive or neurological manifestations may be required.   World Chagas Disease Day 2024: urging early diagnosis and care for life World Chagas Disease Day 2023 to focus on integrating universal care and surveillance at the primary care level World Chagas Disease Day: finding and reporting every case WHO and Bayer renew longstanding collaboration to accelerate control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases Our work Interrupting transmission of Chagas disease to humans Implementing an information and surveillance system of Chagas disease Providing information, education and communication for key people involved in Chagas disease control Providing care to populations affected by Chagas disease In January 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a new road map to address the burden of disease and death imposed by neglected tropical...

                 Human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)"
"Chagas disease is a tropical parasitic infection transmitted by crawling, blood-sucking insects (kissing bugs). You may have flu-like symptoms or none at all. But the disease can lead to life-threatening complications. With prompt treatment, most people with Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, recover fully. Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic infection transmitted by crawling, blood-sucking insects (kissing bugs). The kissing bug is almost exclusive to continental Latin America. The infection results from the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). In most cases, the disease passes to humans who have been exposed (bitten) by an infected triatomine bug (kissing bug). Parents may spread Chagas disease to their offspring during pregnancy or delivery. Other exceedingly rare forms of transmission include: Chagas disease can cause both sudden (acute) and long-term (chronic) symptoms. People can be infected for a long time without showing symptoms. Without treatment, serious complications, including heart and intestinal tract problems, are possible. Chagas disease is curable if treated soon after infection. Unfortunately, most infected people are unaware of their infection until it’s too late, and they present with complications of chronic heart or bowel problems. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Anyone exposed to the feces or urine of an infected kissing bug (triatomine) can develop Chagas disease. The infection is most common in rural or impoverished continental South America, Mexico and Central America. Most infections still occur in Latin American cities of 21 countries, with very few cases of chronic disease in other countries. Public health efforts have decreased disease transmission and helped eradicate it from some areas of South America and Central America. Now infected people live with Chagas in other places, as people with Chagas disease have moved throughout the world. Very few local vector (insect bites) transmission cases occur in the United States from southern states bordering Mexico. There are no published cases of local transmission from insect bites outside continental America. People at highest risk of developing Chagas disease include: Most people can be infected for a long time even a lifetime without showing symptoms. But the disease can still affect you, even if you don’t know you have it. Without treatment, serious complications occur in approximately 20% to 30% of cases, including cardiac (heart) damage and digestive (bowels) or neurological (brain) issues. Chagas disease affects an estimated 6 million people worldwide, with about 300,000 cases per year in the Americas. Approximately 70 million people in America live in areas of exposure and are at risk of contracting the disease. Advertisement The disease is caused by a blood infection with a parasite (T. cruzi). In most cases, people who develop Chagas disease are exposed to T. cruzi from the feces or urine of an infected triatomine (kissing bug). The triatomine is a blood-sucking insect that feeds on animals and humans. They hide during the day and crawl at night to feed. They usually bite at night while you’re asleep. The bites are frequently on or around your face, this is how they got the name ‘kissing bug.’ While feeding, the bugs pee and poop (depositing the parasite T. cruzi ) close to the bite. You may unintentionally rub or scratch the bite, smearing the parasite into the opening in your skin. This allows the parasite T. cruzi to reach your blood. Additionally, Chagas disease may spread through: Chagas disease occurs in two distinct phases: Symptoms are generally mild or go unnoticed, including: The phase may last a few days or a few weeks. Symptoms may start years or even decades after the initial infection. They include: Advertisement Your healthcare provider diagnoses Chagas disease with a simple blood test. The test looks for the presence of antibodies against the parasite. After a positive diagnosis and complete history, your provider may recommend cardiac testing to rule out heart or gastrointestinal complications. These tests may include: Treatment for Chagas disease includes antiparasitic medications, such as benznidazole. In addition, if you have cardiac or intestinal complications from Chagas disease, you may need further treatment. Chronic Chagas disease may cause serious complications that affect the heart and gastrointestinal tract. These complications may be life-threatening if left untreated. Heart complications include: Intestinal tract complications may include: In rare cases, young children or immunosuppressed people infected with Chagas disease develop life-threatening complications, including: If you live in areas of transmission, there are several things you can do to help prevent Chagas disease. These include: With timely treatment, most people with Chagas disease recover fully. The following people should be screened for Chagas disease: Chagas disease is easily diagnosed with a blood test. Contact your doctor for this test if you: A note from Cleveland Clinic Chagas disease is an infection transmitted by crawling insects called kissing bugs. They live mostly in South America and Central America. Kissing bugs crawl on your face before and after they bite you, and you can be infected with the parasite if you scratch those bites. Some people develop flu-like symptoms, while others may never notice. Importantly, Chagas disease can lead to life-threatening complications. If you live in or travel to South America or Central America, you should take precautions like using bug spray and keeping your home clean. If you were born in these areas, or have visited since, be on the lookout for symptoms of Chagas disease and follow up with your primary care provider regularly. Last reviewed on 10/08/2021.

"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a type of long-term kidney disease, in which either there is a gradual loss of kidney function occurs over a period of months to years, or abnormal kidney structure (with normal function).[2][5] Initially generally no symptoms are seen, but later symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion.[2] Complications can relate to hormonal dysfunction of the kidneys and include (in chronological order) high blood pressure (often related to activation of the renin–angiotensin system), bone disease, and anemia.[3][4][11] Additionally CKD patients have markedly increased cardiovascular complications with increased risks of death and hospitalization.[12]
 Causes of chronic kidney disease include diabetes, high blood pressure, glomerulonephritis, and polycystic kidney disease.[5][6] Risk factors include a family history of chronic kidney disease.[2] Diagnosis is by blood tests to measure the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and a urine test to measure albumin.[8] Ultrasound or kidney biopsy may be performed to determine the underlying cause.[5] Several severity-based staging systems are in use.[13][14]
 Screening at-risk people is recommended.[8] Initial treatments may include medications to lower blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol.[10] Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) are generally first-line agents for blood pressure control, as they slow progression of the kidney disease and the risk of heart disease.[15] Loop diuretics may be used to control edema and, if needed, to further lower blood pressure.[16][10][17] NSAIDs should be avoided.[10] Other recommended measures include staying active, and certain dietary changes such as a low-salt diet and the right amount of protein.[vague][10][18] Treatments for anemia and bone disease may also be required.[19][20] Severe disease requires hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or a kidney transplant for survival.[9]
 Chronic kidney disease affected 753 million people globally in 2016 (417 million females and 336 million males.)[1][21] In 2015, it caused 1.2 million deaths, up from 409,000 in 1990.[6][22] The causes that contribute to the greatest number of deaths are high blood pressure at 550,000, followed by diabetes at 418,000, and glomerulonephritis at 238,000.[6]
 CKD is initially without symptoms, and is usually detected on routine screening blood work by either an increase in serum creatinine, or protein in the urine. As the kidney function decreases, more unpleasant symptoms may emerge:[23]
 The three most common causes of CKD in order of frequency as of 2015 are diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glomerulonephritis.[43] About one of five adults with hypertension and one of three adults with diabetes have CKD.
If the cause is unknown, it is called idiopathic.[44]
 Diagnosis of CKD is largely based on history, examination, and urine dipstick combined with the measurement of the serum creatinine level. Differentiating CKD from acute kidney injury (AKI) is important because AKI can be reversible. One diagnostic clue that helps differentiate CKD from AKI is a gradual rise in serum creatinine (over several months or years) as opposed to a sudden increase in the serum creatinine (several days to weeks). In many people with CKD, previous kidney disease or other underlying diseases are already known. A significant number present with CKD of unknown cause.[citation needed]
 Screening those who have neither symptoms nor risk factors for CKD is not recommended.[52][53] Those who should be screened include: those with hypertension or history of cardiovascular disease, those with diabetes or marked obesity, those aged > 60 years, subjects with African American ancestry, those with a history of kidney disease in the past, and subjects who have relatives who had kidney disease requiring dialysis.[citation needed]
 Screening should include calculation of the estimated GFR (eGFR) from the serum creatinine level, and measurement of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a first-morning urine specimen (this reflects the amount of a protein called albumin in the urine), as well as a urine dipstick screen for hematuria.[54]
 The GFR is derived from the serum creatinine and is proportional to 1/creatinine, i.e. it is a reciprocal relationship; the higher the creatinine, the lower the GFR. It reflects one aspect of kidney function, how efficiently the glomeruli – the filtering units – work. The normal GFR is 90–120 ml/min. The units of creatinine vary from country to country, but since the glomeruli make up <5% of the mass of the kidney, the GFR does not indicate all aspects of kidney health and function. This can be done by combining the GFR level with the clinical assessment of the person, including fluid status, and measuring the levels of hemoglobin, potassium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone.[citation needed]
 Kidney ultrasonography is useful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in chronic kidney disease. Whether the underlying pathologic change is glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, or inflammation, the result is often increased echogenicity of the cortex. The echogenicity of the kidney should be related to the echogenicity of either the liver or the spleen (Figure 22 and Figure 23). Moreover, decreased kidney size and cortical thinning are also often seen and especially when disease progresses (Figure 24 and Figure 25). However, kidney size correlates to height, and short persons tend to have small kidneys; thus, kidney size as the only parameter is not reliable.[55]
 Additional tests may include nuclear medicine MAG3 scan to confirm blood flow and establish the differential function between the two kidneys. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans are also used in kidney imaging; with both MAG3 and DMSA being used chelated with the radioactive element technetium-99.[56]
 A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 is considered normal without chronic kidney disease if there is no kidney damage present.
 Kidney damage is defined signs of damage seen in blood, urine, or imaging studies which includes lab albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥ 30.[58] All people with a GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for 3 months are defined as having chronic kidney disease.[58]
 Protein in the urine is regarded as an independent marker for worsening of kidney function and cardiovascular disease. Hence, British guidelines append the letter ""P"" to the stage of chronic kidney disease if protein loss is significant.[59]
 The term ""non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease"" (NDD-CKD) is a designation used to encompass the status of those persons with an established CKD who do not yet require the life-supporting treatments for kidney failure known as kidney replacement therapy (RRT, including maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation).  The condition of individuals with CKD, who require either of the two types of kidney replacement therapy (dialysis or transplant), is referred to as the end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Hence, the start of the ESKD is practically the irreversible conclusion of the NDD-CKD. Even though the NDD-CKD status refers to the status of persons with earlier stages of CKD (stages 1 to 4), people with advanced stage of CKD (stage 5), who have not yet started kidney replacement therapy, are also referred to as NDD-CKD.
 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious condition often linked to diabetes and high blood pressure. There is no cure, but a combination of lifestyle changes and medications can help slow its progression. This might include a plant-dominant diet with less protein and salt, medications to control blood pressure and sugar, and potentially newer anti-inflammatory drugs. Doctors may also focus on managing heart disease risk, preventing infections, and avoiding further kidney damage. While dialysis may eventually be needed, a gradual transition can help preserve remaining kidney function. More research is ongoing to improve CKD management and patient outcomes.[60]
 Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) are recommended as first-line agents since they have been found to slow the decline of kidney function, relative to a more rapid decline in those not on one of these agents.[15] They have also been found to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and death from cardiovascular disease when compared to placebo in individuals with CKD.[15] ACEIs may be superior to ARBs for protection against progression to kidney failure and death from any cause in those with CKD.[15] Aggressive blood pressure lowering decreases people's risk of death.[61]
 Obesity may have a negative impact in CKD, increasing the risk of disease progression to ESKD or kidney failure compared to controls with healthy weight,[71] and when in advanced stages also may hinder people's eligibility to kidney transplantation.[72]  For example, the consumption of high calorie and high fructose beverages can make an individual ""60% more likely to develop CKD"".[73][74]
 Weight management interventions in overweight and obese adults with CKD (of various stages) have been studied to assess its safety and efficacy. A recent systematic review[75] collected evidence from 17 studies which evaluated lifestyle (including dietary, physical activity/exercise, or behavioural strategies used in isolation or in combination), pharmacological (used to reduce absorption or suppress appetite) and surgical interventions. The review concluded that lifestyle interventions may provide some health benefits, namely improving body weight, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), when compared to usual care or controls. Whether these benefits extend to help reducing cardiovascular events, kidney function and risk of death is uncertain. These conclusions were based on very low quality of evidence, so future robust studies are needed. Thus, it is recommended that weight management interventions should be individualised, according to a thorough patients' assessment regarding clinical condition, motivations and preferences.[citation needed]
 High dietary sodium intake may increase the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The effect of dietary restriction of salt in foods has been investigated in people with chronic kidney disease. A 2021 Cochrane review of controlled trials in people with CKD at any stage, including those on dialysis, found high-certainty evidence that reduced salt intake may help to lower both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as albuminuria.[76] However, there was also moderate certainty evidence that some people may experience hypotensive symptoms, such as dizziness, following sudden sodium restriction. The effect of salt restriction on extracellular fluid, oedema, and total body weight reduction was uncertain.[76]
 In people with CKD who require hemodialysis, there is a risk that vascular blockage due to clotting, may prevent dialysis therapy from being possible. Omega-3 fatty acids contribute to the production of eicosanoid molecules that reduce clotting. However, a Cochrane review in 2018 did not find clear evidence that omega-3 supplementation has any impact on the prevention of vascular blockage in people with CKD.[77] There was also moderate certainty that supplementation did not prevent hospitalisation or death within a 12-month period.[77]
 There is moderate-certainty evidence that regular consumption of oral protein-based nutritional supplements may increase serum albumin levels slightly in people with CKD, especially among those requiring hemodialysis or who are malnourished.[78] Prealbumin level and mid-arm muscle circumference may also be increased following supplementation, though the certainty of evidence is low.[78] Despite possible improvement in these indicators of nutritional status, it is not certain that protein supplements affect quality of life, life expectancy, inflammation or body composition.[78]
 A Cochrane review of controlled trials comparing intravenous (IV) iron therapy with oral iron supplements, found low-certainty evidence that people receiving IV-iron treatment were 1.71 times as likely to reach their target hemoglobin levels.[79] Overall, hemoglobin was 0.71 g/dl higher than those treated with oral iron supplements. Iron stores in the liver, estimated by serum ferritin, were also 224.84 μg/L higher in those receiving IV-iron.[79] However, there was also low-certainty evidence that allergic reactions were more likely following IV-iron therapy. It was unclear whether type of iron therapy administration affects the risk of death from any cause, including cardiovascular, nor whether it may alter the number of people who may require a blood transfusion or dialysis.[79]
 People with CKD experience sleep disorders, thus unable to get quality sleep.[80] There are several strategies that could help, such as relaxation techniques, exercise, acupressure and medication:[80]
 The available options studied have not shown any of them to be effective in the treatment of sleep disorders.[80] This means that it is unknown what is the best guidance to improve sleep quality in this population.[80]
 There is limited evidence suggesting that eHealth interventions may improve dietary sodium intake and fluid management for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD).[81] The findings are based on low certainty evidence of 43 studies. So, more large and higher quality research studies are needed to understand the impact of eHealth on the health of people with CKD.[81]
 Guidelines for referral to a nephrologist vary between countries.  Most agree that nephrology referral is required by Stage 4 CKD (when eGFR/1.73m2 is less than 30 mL/min; or decreasing by more than 3 mL/min/year).[82]
 It may also be useful at an earlier stage (e.g. CKD3) when urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio is more than 30 mg/mmol, when blood pressure is difficult to control, or when hematuria or other findings suggest either a primarily glomerular disorder or secondary disease amenable to specific treatment.  Other benefits of early nephrology referral include proper education regarding options for kidney replacement therapy as well as pre-emptive transplantation, and timely workup and placement of an arteriovenous fistula in those people with chronic kidney disease opting for future hemodialysis.[citation needed]
 At stage 5 CKD, kidney replacement therapy is usually required, in the form of either dialysis or a kidney transplant.
 In CKD numerous uremic toxins accumulate in the blood. Even when ESKD (largely synonymous with CKD5) is treated with dialysis, the toxin levels do not go back to normal as dialysis is not that efficient. Similarly, after a kidney transplant, the levels may not go back to normal as the transplanted kidney may not work 100%. If it does, the creatinine level is often normal. The toxins show various cytotoxic activities in the serum and have different molecular weights, and some of them are bound to other proteins, primarily to albumin. Uremic toxins are classified into three groups as small water-soluble solutes, middle molecular-weight solutes, and protein-bound solutes.[83] Hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membrane, long or frequent treatment, and increased blood/dialysate flow has improved removal of water-soluble small molecular weight uremic toxins. Middle molecular weight molecules are removed more effectively with hemodialysis using a high-flux membrane, hemodiafiltration and hemofiltration. However, conventional dialysis treatment is limited in its ability to remove protein-bound uremic toxins.[84]
 CKD increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, and people with CKD often have other risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood lipids. The most common cause of death in people with CKD is cardiovascular disease rather than kidney failure.
 Chronic kidney disease results in worse all-cause mortality (the overall death rate) which increases as kidney function decreases.[85]  The leading cause of death in chronic kidney disease is cardiovascular disease, regardless of whether there is progression to stage 5.[85][86][87]
 While kidney replacement therapies can maintain people indefinitely and prolong life, the quality of life is negatively affected.[88][89] Kidney transplantation increases the survival of people with stage 5 CKD when compared to other options;[90][91] however, it is associated with an increased short-term mortality due to complications of the surgery. Transplantation aside, high-intensity home hemodialysis appears to be associated with improved survival and a greater quality of life, when compared to the conventional three-times-a-week hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.[92]
 People with ESKD are at increased overall risk for cancer.[93] This risk is particularly high in younger people and gradually diminishes with age.[93] Medical specialty professional organizations recommend that physicians do not perform routine cancer screening in people with limited life expectancies due to ESKD because evidence does not show that such tests lead to improved outcomes.[94][95]
 In children, growth failure is a common complication from CKD. Children with CKD will be shorter than 97% of children the same age and sex. This can be treated with additional nutritional support, or medication such as growth hormone[96]
 In a review from 2022 survival and quality of life was investigated in patients who had decided against dialysis treatment when reaching end-stage chronic kidney disease.
41 longitudinal studies (cohort studies) with a total of 5,102 patients were evaluated. The mean age of patients per study was 60–87 years. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the time of decision per study was 7–19 ml/min pro 1.73 m2.
 The median survival per study was:
 The longest survival times per study from the three studies with the highest median were 82, 79, and 75 months.
 During the observation periods of 8 to 24 months mental well-being improved, and physical well-being and quality of life were largely stable until the late phase of the illness.
 The authors of the review reached the following conclusion: ""Our findings challenge the common misconception that the only alternative to dialysis for many patients with advanced CKD is no care or death.""[97][98]
 In a review from 2021 25 studies were analyzed that had compared survival times and quality of life between patients with and without dialysis. Survival was generally longer with dialysis, but from the age of 80 and in elderly patients with comorbidities this effect became uncertain. Concerning quality of life there was a trend that patients without dialysis had an advantage.[99]
 About one in ten people have chronic kidney disease. In Canada 1.9 to 2.3 million people were estimated to have CKD in 2008.[68] CKD affected an estimated 16.8% of U.S. adults aged 20 years and older in the period from 1999 to 2004.[100] In 2007 8.8% of the population of Great Britain and Northern Ireland had symptomatic CKD.[101]
 Chronic kidney disease was the cause of 956,000 deaths globally in 2013, up from 409,000 deaths in 1990.[22]
 The cause of chronic kidney disease is in some cases not known; it is referred to as chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology (CKDu). As of 2020[update] a rapidly progressive chronic kidney disease, unexplained by diabetes and hypertension, had increased dramatically in prevalence over a few decades in several regions in Central America and Mexico, a CKDu referred to as the Mesoamerican nephropathy (MeN). It was estimated in 2013 that at least 20,000 men had died prematurely, some in their 20s and 30s; a figure of 40,000 per year was estimated in 2020. In some affected areas CKD mortality was five times the national rate. MeN primarily affects men working as sugarcane labourers.[47] The cause is unknown, but in 2020 the science found a clearer connection between heavy labour in high temperatures and incidence of CKDu; improvements such as regular access to water, rest and shade, can significantly decrease the potential CKDu incidence.[102] CKDu also affects people in Sri Lanka where it is the eighth largest cause of in-hospital mortality.[103]
 African, Hispanics, and South Asians, particularly those from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and India, are at high risk of developing CKD. Africans are at greater risk due to the number of people affected with hypertension among them. As an example, 37% of ESKD cases in African Americans can be attributed to high blood pressure, compared with 19% among Caucasians.[7] Treatment efficacy also differs between racial groups. Administration of antihypertensive drugs generally halts disease progression in white populations but has little effect in slowing kidney disease among black people, and additional treatment such as bicarbonate therapy is often required.[7] While lower socioeconomic status contributes to the number of people affected with CKD, differences in the number of people affected by CKD are still evident between Africans and Whites when controlling for environmental factors.[7]
 Although CKDu was first documented among sugar cane workers in Costa Rica in the 1970s, it may well have affected plantation labourers since the introduction of sugar cane farming to the Caribbean in the 1600s. In colonial times the death records of slaves on sugar plantations was much higher than for slaves forced into other labour.[102]
 Denial of care in chronic kidney disease treatment and management is a significant issue for minority populations. This can be due to healthcare provider bias, structural barriers, and health insurance coverage disparities. Healthcare provider biases can lead to under-treatment, misdiagnosis, or delayed diagnosis. Structural barriers, such as lack of insurance and limited healthcare facilities, hinder access to timely care. Furthermore, health insurance coverage disparities, with minority populations lacking adequate coverage, contribute to these disparities. Denial of care worsens health outcomes and perpetuates existing health inequities. 
 Problems with Race-Based Metrics of Kidney Function: Race-based kidney function metrics, particularly normalizing creatinine, pose ethical challenges in diagnosing and managing chronic kidney disease (CKD). While certain racial and ethnic groups are at higher risk, using race as a reference range may reinforce stereotypes and perpetuate health disparities. This approach fails to account for the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and social factors influencing kidney function. Depending solely on race-based metrics may lead to misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis in minority populations. Alternative approaches that consider socioeconomic status, environmental exposures, and genetic vulnerability, are needed to accurately assess kidney function and address CKD care disparities.
 The International Society of Nephrology is an international body representing specialists in kidney diseases.
 It was said to be costing the National Health Service about £1.5 billion a year in 2020.[104]
 Kidney Care UK and The UK National Kidney Federation represent people with chronic kidney disease. The Renal Association represents Kidney physicians and works closely with the National Service Framework for kidney disease.
 Kidney Health Australia serves that country.
 The incidence rate of CKD in dogs was 15.8 cases per 10,000 dog years at risk. The mortality rate of CKD was 9.7 deaths per 10,000 dog years at risk. (Rates developed from a population of 600,000 insured Swedish dogs; one dog year at risk is one dog at risk for one year). The breeds with the highest rates were the Bernese mountain dog, miniature schnauzer and boxer. The Swedish elkhound, Siberian husky and Finnish spitz were the breeds with the lowest rates.[105][106]
 Cats with chronic kidney disease may have a buildup of waste products usually removed by the kidneys. They may appear lethargic, unkempt, and lose weight, and may have hypertension. The disease can prevent appropriate concentration of urine, causing cats to urinate greater volumes and drink more water to compensate. Loss of important proteins and vitamins through urine may cause abnormal metabolism and loss of appetite. The buildup of acids within blood can result in acidosis, which can lead to anemia (which can sometimes be indicated by pink or whitish gums, but by no means does the presence of normal colored gums guarantee that anemia is not present or developing), and lethargy.[107]
 As of 2019[update] several compounds are in development for the treatment of CKD.  These include the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) olmesartan medoxomil; and sulodexide, a mixture of low molecular weight heparin and dermatan sulfate.[108][109]

 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work as well as they should. It's a common condition often associated with getting older. It can affect anyone, but it's more common in people who are black or of south Asian origin. CKD can get worse over time and eventually the kidneys may stop working altogether, but this is uncommon. Many people with CKD are able to live long lives with the condition. There are usually no symptoms of kidney disease in the early stages. It may only be diagnosed if you have a blood or urine test for another reason and the results show a possible problem with your kidneys. At a more advanced stage, symptoms can include: See a GP if you have persistent or worrying symptoms that you think could be caused by kidney disease. Find out more about the symptoms of CKD. Chronic kidney disease is usually caused by other conditions that put a strain on the kidneys. Often it's the result of a combination of different problems. CKD can be caused by: You can help prevent CKD by making healthy lifestyle changes and ensuring any underlying conditions you have are well controlled. CKD can be diagnosed using blood and urine tests. These tests look for high levels of certain substances in your blood and urine that are signs your kidneys are not working properly. If you're at a high risk of developing kidney disease (for example, you have a known risk factor such as high blood pressure or diabetes), you may be advised to have regular tests to check for CKD so it's found at an early stage. The results of your blood and urine tests can be used to tell the stage of your kidney disease. This is a number that reflects how severe the damage to your kidneys is, with a higher number indicating more serious CKD. Find out more about how CKD is diagnosed. There's no cure for CKD, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and stop it getting worse. Your treatment will depend on how severe your condition is. The main treatments are: You'll also be advised to have regular check-ups to monitor your condition. Find out more about how CKD is treated and living with CKD. CKD can range from a mild condition with no or few symptoms, to a very serious condition where the kidneys stop working, sometimes called kidney failure. Most people with CKD will be able to control their condition with medicine and regular check-ups. CKD only progresses to kidney failure in around 2 in 100 people with the condition. If you have CKD, even if it's mild, you're at an increased risk of developing other serious problems, such as cardiovascular disease. This is a group of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, which includes heart attack and stroke. Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of death in people with kidney disease, although healthy lifestyle changes and medicine can help reduce your risk of developing it.

"Kidney disease means your kidneys aren’t working properly and are beginning to lose their function. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) worsens over time. High blood pressure and diabetes are two common causes of CKD. There’s no cure for CKD, but you can take steps to preserve function for as long as possible. Late-stage kidney disease requires dialysis or a kidney transplant. Chronic kidney disease (CKD and chronic renal disease) means that there’s damage to your kidneys and they aren’t working as well as they should. Your kidneys are like a filter in your body — filtering out wastes, toxins and extra water from your blood. They also help with other functions like bone and red blood cell health. When your kidneys begin to lose their function, they can’t filter waste, which means the waste builds up in your blood. Kidney disease is called “chronic” because kidney function slowly decreases over time. CKD can lead to kidney failure, which is also called end-stage kidney disease. Not everyone with CKD will develop kidney failure, but the disease will often worsen without treatment. There’s no cure for chronic kidney disease. But there are steps you can take to slow kidney damage. Treatments like dialysis and transplantation are options for kidney failure (end-stage kidney disease). You have two kidneys. They’re bean-shaped organs that are located toward your back, on either side of your spine, just underneath your rib cage. Each kidney is about the size of your fist. Your kidneys have many jobs, but their main job is to clean your blood, getting rid of toxins, waste and excess water as urine (pee). Your kidneys also balance the amount of electrolytes (such as salt and potassium) and minerals in your body, make hormones that control blood pressure, make red blood cells and keep your bones strong. If your kidneys are damaged and don’t work as they should, wastes can build up in your blood and make you sick. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy There are five stages of chronic kidney disease. The stages are based on how well your kidneys are able to filter out waste from your blood. Blood and urine tests determine which stage of CKD you’re in. The stages range from very mild (stage 1) to kidney failure (stage 5). Healthcare providers determine the stage of your kidney function according to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Your GFR is a number based on the amount of creatinine, a waste product, found in your blood.  About 15% of adults in the United States have chronic kidney disease. Some 37 million people in the U.S. are living with chronic kidney disease. In the early stages of kidney disease, you usually don’t have noticeable symptoms. As the disease worsens, symptoms may include: Keep in mind that it can take years for waste to build up in your blood and cause symptoms. Advertisement You typically don’t have any signs of kidney disease, especially in its early stages. Once you begin having symptoms, the first sign something is wrong may involve swelling in your hands and feet, itchy skin or needing to pee more often. Since symptoms vary, it’s best to call your healthcare provider if you believe there’s something wrong. Kidney diseases happen when your kidneys are damaged and can’t filter your blood. With chronic kidney disease, the damage tends to happen over the course of several years. High blood pressure (hypertension) and diabetes are the two most common causes of chronic kidney disease. Other causes and conditions that affect kidney function and can cause chronic kidney disease include: Yes, kidney disease can run in biological families. Risk factors for CKD, like diabetes, also tend to run in families. Advertisement Anyone can get chronic kidney disease. You’re more at risk for chronic kidney disease if you: Some of the complications of chronic kidney disease include: First, your healthcare provider will take your medical history, conduct a physical exam, ask about any medications you’re currently taking and ask about any symptoms you’ve noticed. Your healthcare provider will order blood and urine tests to check kidney function. Specifically, the blood tests will check: Urine tests will look for protein (albumin) and blood in your pee. Well-functioning kidneys shouldn’t contain either. Other tests may include imaging tests to look for problems with the size and structure of your kidneys — such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computerized tomography (CT) scans. Your healthcare provider may also order a kidney biopsy to check for a specific type of kidney disease or to determine the amount of kidney damage. There’s no cure for chronic kidney disease (CKD), but steps can be taken to preserve your kidney function so they work as long as possible. If you have reduced kidney function: Depending on the cause of your kidney disease, you may be prescribed one or more medications. Medications your nephrologist may prescribe include: Because there’s no cure for CKD, if you’re in end-stage kidney disease, you and your healthcare team must consider additional options. Complete kidney failure will result in death if it’s left untreated. Options for end-stage kidney disease include dialysis and kidney transplantation. Dialysis is a procedure that uses machines to remove waste products from your body when your kidneys are no longer able to perform this function. There are two major types of dialysis: Kidney transplantation involves replacing an unhealthy kidney with a healthy kidney. Kidneys for transplantation come from two sources: living donors and deceased donors. Living donors are usually family members, partners or friends. A living kidney donor is possible because a person can live well with one healthy kidney. Deceased donor kidneys usually come from people who are organ donors. All donors are carefully screened to make sure there’s a suitable match and to prevent any transmissible diseases or other complications. On average, people wait about three to five years for a kidney from a deceased donor. It’s usually quicker to receive a kidney from a living donor. Seeing your healthcare provider on a regular basis throughout your life is a good start for preventing kidney disease. About 1 in every 3 people in the United States is at risk for kidney disease. People at high risk may have regular tests to check for CKD so it’s detected as early as possible. Some other things you can do to prevent CKD are: If you have kidney disease, you can still live a productive home and work life and enjoy time with your family and friends. To have the best outcome possible, it’s important for you to become an active member of your treatment team. Early detection and appropriate treatment are important in slowing the disease progression, with the goal of preventing or delaying kidney failure. You’ll need to keep your medical appointments, take your medications as prescribed, stick to a nutritious diet and monitor your blood pressure and blood sugar. While CKD can lead to death, many people with the condition live long and happy lives after diagnosis. Most people who seek treatment for kidney disease and manage their condition never progress to kidney failure or death. That’s why it’s important to attend all your checkups and work with your healthcare provider on a treatment plan. The leading cause of death in people with CKD is actually heart disease, a complication of CKD. Managing other health conditions that negatively impact your kidneys is also key to maintaining your kidney function. Early detection can help prevent kidney disease from worsening to kidney failure. Work with your healthcare provider to manage conditions that are known to cause kidney disease. These include diabetes, high blood pressure and other diseases that affect your kidneys. Since kidney disease often doesn’t cause symptoms in the early stages, the best thing you can do is work with your provider to understand your risk and attend all annual or scheduled visits with your provider. Most people don’t have symptoms until CKD is severe. Contact your provider if you: You may not know your kidneys are struggling. Most people don’t have symptoms of kidney disease in the early stages. That’s why it’s important to attend annual wellness exams with your primary care provider to manage chronic conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure that can lead to kidney disease. In people with healthy kidneys, there aren’t necessarily bad foods or foods that hurt your kidneys. But, if you have CKD, your healthcare provider may recommend a kidney-friendly diet. Elements of a kidney-friendly diet may include: Since following a kidney-friendly diet is hard to understand and to do, it’s always a good idea to consult a dietitian as part of your treatment plan. They can help make sure you’re eating the right types of food if you have chronic kidney disease. Your pee shouldn’t change color, but may be foamy or frothy, which means there’s excess protein in your pee. Excess protein means your kidneys aren’t filtering toxins from your body. A note from Cleveland Clinic A CKD diagnosis can make a profound impact on your life. Treatment for the condition is lifelong, and it takes time and patience. Don’t be afraid to ask your healthcare providers any questions you have. Try to take comfort in the fact that managing kidney disease is possible. In fact, many people live many years with kidney disease. Lean on your family members or friends to help you cope. There are also online and in-person support groups available to help people with CKD connect with each other. Seek support from those who love you, so that together, you can work through treatment for CKD. Last reviewed on 05/07/2023. Learn more about our editorial process.

"Churg-Strauss syndrome is a disorder marked by blood vessel inflammation. This inflammation can restrict blood flow to organs and tissues, sometimes permanently damaging them. This condition is also known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Adult-onset asthma is the most common sign of Churg-Strauss syndrome. The disorder can also cause other problems, such as nasal allergies, sinus problems, rash, gastrointestinal bleeding, and pain and numbness in your hands and feet. Churg-Strauss syndrome is rare and has no cure. Symptoms can usually be controlled with steroids and other powerful immunosuppressant drugs. Churg-Strauss syndrome varies greatly from person to person. Some people have only mild symptoms. Others have severe or life-threatening complications. Also known as EGPA, the syndrome tends to occur in three stages and gets progressively worse. Almost everyone with the condition has asthma, chronic sinusitis and elevated counts of white blood cells called eosinophils. Other signs and symptoms might include: See your doctor if you develop breathing difficulties or a runny nose that doesn't go away, especially if it's accompanied by persistent facial pain. Also see your doctor if you have asthma or nasal allergies that suddenly worsen. Churg-Strauss syndrome is rare, and it's more likely that these symptoms have some other cause. But it's important that your doctor evaluate them. Early diagnosis and treatment improve the chances of a good outcome. The cause of Churg-Strauss syndrome is largely unknown. It's likely that a combination of genes and environmental factors, such as allergens or certain medications, triggers an overactive immune system response. Instead of protecting against invading bacteria and viruses, the immune system targets healthy tissue, causing widespread inflammation. While anyone can get Churg-Strauss syndrome, people are usually around age 50 when diagnosed. Other potential risk factors include chronic asthma or nasal problems. Genetics and exposures to environmental allergens also may play a role. Churg-Strauss syndrome can affect many organs, including the lungs, sinuses, skin, gastrointestinal system, kidneys, muscles, joints and heart. Without treatment, the disease can be fatal. Complications, which depend on the organs involved, can include: Feb 07, 2024 CON-XXXXXXXX Mayo Clinic does not endorse companies or products. Advertising revenue supports our not-for-profit mission.

"EGPA is a rare disease that happens when certain types of cells in your blood or tissues inflame (swell). The inflammation can affect many organs, including your heart and kidneys. Although the cause of the inflammation is unknown, experts suspect that it has something to do with the immune system failing to function correctly. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, formerly Churg-Strauss Syndrome) is a disease caused by inflammation (swelling) that occurs in certain types of cells in your blood or in your tissues. Everyone who gets EGPA has a history of asthma and/or allergies. It can affect many of your organs. Almost all people with EGPA have increased numbers of ""allergic type"" blood cells called eosinophils. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that usually make up 5% or less of the total white blood cell count. In EGPA, eosinophils usually make up more than 10% of the total white blood cell count. In addition, most biopsies (tissue samples) contain clusters of cells called ""granulomas"" that may or may not involve blood vessels. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Vasculitis is a general medical term that means inflammation of the blood vessels. When your blood vessels become inflamed, several things can happen: This inflammation causes injury to your lungs, nose, sinuses, skin, joints, nerves, intestinal tract, heart and/or kidneys and rarely the brain. Advertisement It is an extremely rare disease – there are only two to five new cases a year per one million people. EGPA can occur in people of all ages, from children to the elderly. The average age that someone is diagnosed is between 35 and 50 years old. EGPA appears to affect men and women equally. Advertisement No. The cause of EGPA inflammation is unknown. Your immune system plays a role in EGPA. The immune system acts to protect the body against “foreign invaders” (germs, bacteria) that cause infections, disease and other injuries to the body. Sometimes your immune system becomes over active and can cause inflammation. No. No, it’s not hereditary. Because EGPA can affect several different organs, there is a wide range of symptoms. People who have EGPA may feel generally ill and fatigued or have fevers. They may lose their appetite and lose weight. Other symptoms depend on the organs or diseases involved. For example, you may have: You may have any combination of these symptoms. Kidney disease caused by EGPA often does not have any symptoms. You may not know about inflammation of the kidney until the kidneys begin to stop working. Therefore, if you have any form of vasculitis, you must have regular urinalyses (examinations of the urine). The healthcare provider may use the following tests to diagnose EGPA: Once the diagnosis of EGPA is suspected, a biopsy (tissue sample) is often performed to try to find eosinophils, eosinophilic granulomas and/or vasculitis. Biopsies are not required in all cases, and are only recommended when abnormal findings are seen in the exam, laboratory tests, or imaging tests. A variety of immunosuppressive drugs (drugs that suppress the immune system) are used to treat EGPA. Your healthcare provider will choose the drug based on how the EGPA is affecting you - whether it is mild (for instance, affecting the skin or joint), or potentially life-threatening. Glucocorticoids such as prednisone or prednisolone are the most commonly used treatments. People who have a mild disease (those whose disease does not affect the nervous system, heart, kidneys, intestinal tract, or show other features of severe disease) might do extremely well on corticosteroid therapy alone. Once you have a dramatic improvement on this drug, the dosage is reduced to the lowest amount that keeps the disease under control. People with EGPA that affects critical organs are usually treated with corticosteroids combined with another immunosuppressive drug, such as cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®), methotrexate, Mycophenolate Mofetil or azathioprine (Imuran®). These drugs are also used to treat other medical conditions. Azathioprine is used to prevent organ transplant rejection and is also a treatment for lupus and other autoimmune diseases. High doses of cyclophosphamide and methotrexate are used to treat certain types of cancer. In vasculitis, these drugs are given at doses that are 10 to 100 times lower than that used to treat cancer in order to suppress the immune system. Biologic medications are also used in EGPA such as Rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody directed against B cells) and Mepolizumab (anti-interleukin (IL)-5 monoclonal antibodies. Mepolizumab is approved by the FDA for the treatment of EGPA and is indicated in people whose disease is not controlled with oral glucocorticoids alone and who do not have severe disease. Rituximab can be used in people with kidney, skin and nerve involvements. The goal of treatment is to stop all damage that comes from EGPA. This is known as ""remission."" Once the disease begins to improve, your healthcare provider may slowly reduce the corticosteroid dose, and eventually stop it completely. Stopping it completely may be difficult if a person has significant asthma, as the airways can be very sensitive to corticosteroids. If cyclophosphamide is used for severe EGPA, it is often only given until you go into remission (usually around three to six months); you’ll then switch to another immunosuppressive agent, such as methotrexate, Mycophenolate Mofetil, azathioprine or Mepolizumab, to maintain remission. The duration of maintenance immunosuppressive drugs depends on the person. In most instances, it is given for least one to two years before the healthcare provider considers slowly reducing the dosage and eventually stopping it. No, surgery is not part of the treatment plan for EGPA. There are no appropriate at-home treatments. Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions. Nothing you eat or drink affects EGPA. All immunosuppressive drugs can have side effects. Each drug can have its own side effects, so it is very important to watch for them. A person with EGPA may tolerate these drugs at first; however, this may not last. This is why it’s so important to watch for side effects, even after you stop taking the drug. Blood tests are also used to evaluate the illness itself. There are many side effects for glucocorticoids, so be sure to stay in close contact with your healthcare provider. At this time there are no known ways to prevent this disease. Although EGPA can be an increasingly serious illness, many people do extremely well. On average, after five years of illness, more than 80% of people survive the effects of EGPA. How those with EGPA do is strongly related to how severe their illness is. The best opportunity to limit damage to the organs is when treatment starts right away and is carefully supervised by a healthcare provider who is knowledgeable about EGPA. Even people who have the most severe EGPA can go into remission when they are treated quickly and followed closely. After you go into remission, it is possible that the EGPA. can come back (relapse). People with asthma or nasal allergies can often have worsening of these symptoms that is separate from vasculitis. Relapses involving vasculitis occur in about 30% to 50% of people with EGPA. These relapses may be similar to what you experienced at the time of their vasculitis diagnosis. It’s possible to reduce the likelihood of a severe relapse by reporting any new symptoms to your healthcare provider right away, seeing the healthcare provider on a regular basis, and having regular checkups with laboratory tests and imaging. The treatment approach for relapses is similar to that of newly diagnosed disease, and it’s possible again for these people to go into remission again. EGPA shouldn’t stop you from your normal, day-to-day activities, as long as you seek and receive treatment from your healthcare provider. A note from Cleveland Clinic EGPA is a serious illness that can affect a variety of organs but, fortunately, more than 80% survive the symptoms (after five years of illness). Stay in close contact with your healthcare provider and be sure to follow his or her instructions regarding your care. Last reviewed on 01/06/2021. Learn more about our editorial process.

 Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as  allergic granulomatosis,[3][4] is an extremely rare autoimmune condition that causes inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels (vasculitis) in persons with a history of airway allergic hypersensitivity (atopy).[5]
 It usually manifests in three stages. The early (prodromal) stage is marked by airway inflammation; almost all patients experience asthma and/or allergic rhinitis. The second stage is characterized by abnormally high numbers of eosinophils (hypereosinophilia), which causes tissue damage, most commonly to the lungs and the digestive tract.[5] The third stage consists of vasculitis, which can eventually lead to cell death and can be life-threatening.[5]
 This condition is now called ""eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis"" to remove all eponyms from the vasculitides. To facilitate the transition, it was referred to as ""eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg–Strauss)"" for a period of time starting in 2012.[6] Prior to this it was known as Churg–Strauss syndrome, named after Jacob Churg and Lotte Strauss, who first published about the syndrome in 1951 using the term allergic granulomatosis to describe it.[3] It is a type of systemic necrotizing vasculitis.
 Effective treatment of EGPA requires suppression of the immune system with medication. This is typically glucocorticoids, followed by other agents such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine.[citation needed]
 Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis consists of three stages, but not all patients develop all three stages or progress from one stage to the next in the same order;[7] whereas some patients may develop severe or life-threatening complications such as gastrointestinal involvement and heart disease, some patients are only mildly affected, e.g. with skin lesions and nasal polyps.[8] EGPA is consequently considered a highly variable condition in terms of its presentation and its course.[7][8]
 The prodromal stage is characterized by allergy. Almost all patients experience asthma and/or allergic rhinitis,[9] with more than 90% having a history of asthma that is either a new development, or the worsening of pre-existing asthma,[10] which may require systemic corticosteroid treatment.[7] On average, asthma develops from three to nine years before the other signs and symptoms.[7]
 The allergic rhinitis may produce symptoms such as rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, and the formation of nasal polyps that require surgical removal, often more than once.[9] Sinusitis may also be present.[9]
 The second stage is characterized by an abnormally high level of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood and tissues as a result of abnormal eosinophil proliferation, impaired eosinophil apoptosis, and increased toxicity due to eosinophil metabolic products.[7][11] A normal 5% eosinophil composition in total leukocyte count can be elevated to 60% in EGPA, and this local accumulation of eosinophil is involved in the pathogenesis of asthma described in the allergic stage by initiating and maintaining immune responses in inflammation.[12][13] The symptoms of hypereosinophilia depend on which part of the body is affected, but most often it affects the lungs and digestive tract.[7] The signs and symptoms of hypereosinophilia may include weight loss, night sweats, asthma, cough, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal bleeding.[7] Fever and malaise are often present.[14] The eosinophilic stage can last months or years, and its symptoms can disappear, only to return later.[7]
 The third and final stage, and hallmark of EGPA, is inflammation of the blood vessels, and the consequent reduction of blood flow to various organs and tissues.[7] The damage done to the blood vessels can be explained by the overabundance of eosinophils that are produced and flowing throughout the vasculature of the body; eosinophil production, while essential for assisting inflammatory responses to infections and diseases, can lead to tissue damage when it is done in excess.[15] Local and systemic symptoms become more widespread and are compounded by new symptoms from the vasculitis.[14]
 Severe complications may arise. Blood clots may develop within the damaged arteries in severe cases, particularly in arteries of the abdominal region, which is followed by infarction and cell death, or slow atrophy.[14] Many patients experience severe abdominal complaints; these are most often due to peritonitis and/or ulcerations and perforations of the gastrointestinal tract, but occasionally due to acalculous cholecystitis or granulomatous appendicitis.[14]
 The most serious complication of the vasculitic stage is heart disease, which is the cause of nearly one-half of all deaths in patients with EGPA.[14] Among heart disease-related deaths, the most usual cause is inflammation of the heart muscle caused by the high level of eosinophils, although some are deaths due to inflammation of the arteries that supply blood to the heart or pericardial tamponade.[14] Kidney complications have been reported as being less common.[16] Complications in the kidneys can include glomerulonephritis, which prevents the kidneys' ability to filter the blood, ultimately causing wastes to build up in the bloodstream.[17]
 Diagnostic markers include eosinophil granulocytes and granulomas in affected tissue, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) against neutrophil granulocytes. Two pathological subsets of EGPA are differentiated by the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), autoantibodies that mistakenly target and attack specific proteins found within the cytoplasm of neutrophils.[18] The ANCA+ subtype is characterized by predominantly vasculitis-like manifestations, while the ANCA- subtype is more commonly associated with eosinophilic-related symptoms.[18] Approximately 30-40% of EGPA cases are ANCA+.[18] While the pathogenic mechanisms are not fully understood, this finding suggests a role of B cells – the precursors of ANCA-producing plasma cells – in the pathogenesis of EGPA.
 The American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for diagnosis of Churg–Strauss syndrome lists these criteria:[needs update]
 For classification purposes, a patient shall be said to have EGPA if at least four of these six criteria are positive. The presence of any four or more of the six criteria yields a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 99.7%.[2][needs update]
 The French Vasculitis Study Group has developed a five-point system (""five-factor score"") that predicts the risk of death in Churg–Strauss syndrome using clinical presentations. These factors are:[19]
 Having none of these factors indicates milder case, with a five-year mortality rate of 11.9%. The presence of one factor indicates severe disease, with a five-year mortality rate of 26%, and three or more indicate very severe disease: 46% five-year mortality rate.[20]
 On CT scan of the lungs, peripheral parenchymal opacification (pulmonary consolidation or ground-glass opacity) in the middle and lower zones is the predominant pattern. Interlobular septal thickening (septa separating the secondary pulmonary lobules can be due to pulmonary odema secondary to heart failure.[21]
 Treatment for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis includes glucocorticoids (such as prednisolone) and other immunosuppressive drugs (such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide). In many cases, the disease can be put into a type of chemical remission through drug therapy, but the disease is chronic and lifelong.[citation needed]
 A systematic review conducted in 2007 indicated all patients should be treated with high-dose steroids, but in patients with a five-factor score of one or higher, cyclophosphamide pulse therapy should be commenced, with 12 pulses leading to fewer relapses than six. Remission can be maintained with a less toxic drug, such as azathioprine or methotrexate.[22]
 On 12 December 2017, the FDA approved mepolizumab, the first drug therapy specifically indicated for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.[23] Patients taking mepolizumab experienced a ""significant improvement"" in their symptoms.[23] Mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-5, a major factor in eosinophil survival.[24]
 In addition to mepolizumab, a number of emerging targeted biotherapies—including the anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab, immunomodulation with Interferon-α, and B cell therapy with rituximab—may lead to increasingly personalized treatment regimens for future EGPA patients. A review of EGPA treatments conducted in 2020 proposes integrating targeted biotherapies into EGPA management plans following failure of treatment with corticosteroids.[25]
 Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis was first described by pathologists Jacob Churg (1910–2005) and Lotte Strauss (1913–1985) at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City in 1951, using the term ""allergic granulomatosis"" to describe it.[3][26] They reported ""fever...hypereosinophilia, symptoms of cardiac failure, renal damage, and peripheral neuropathy, resulting from vascular embarrassment in various systems of organs""[27] in a series of 13 patients with necrotizing vasculitis previously diagnosed as ""periarteritis nodosa"", accompanied by hypereosinophilia and severe asthma.[28] Churg and Strauss noted three features which distinguished their patients from other patients with periarteritis nodosa but without asthma: necrotizing vasculitis, tissue eosinophilia, and extravascular granuloma.[28] As a result, they proposed that these cases were evident of a different disease entity, which they referred to as ""allergic granulomatosis and angiitis"".[28]
 The memoir Patient, by musician Ben Watt (of Everything but the Girl fame), deals with his experience with EGPA in 1992, and his recovery.[29] Watt's case was unusual in that it mainly affected his gastrointestinal tract, leaving his lungs largely unaffected; this unusual presentation contributed to a delay in proper diagnosis. His treatment required the removal of 5 m (15 ft) of necrotized small intestine (about 75%), leaving him on a permanently restricted diet.[29]
 Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, the president of Nigeria from 2007 to 2010, reportedly had EGPA and died in office of complications of the disease.[30]
 DJ and author Charlie Gillett was diagnosed with EGPA in 2006; he died four years later.[31]
 Japanese ski jumper Taku Takeuchi, who won the bronze medal in the team competition in 2014, has the disease and competed at the Sochi Olympics less than a month after being released from hospital treatment.[32]
 New Zealand reporter and television presenter Toni Street was diagnosed with the condition in 2015.[33][34] Street has had health problems for several years, including removal of her gallbladder four months prior.[35]
 American professional basketball player Willie Naulls died on 22 November 2018 in Laguna Niguel, California, from respiratory failure due to EGPA,[36] which he had been battling for eight years.[37]
 Canadian stand-up comic Candy Palmater died on December 25, 2021, shortly after being diagnosed with EGPA.[38]

 Cirrhosis is scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by long-term liver damage. The scar tissue prevents the liver working properly. Cirrhosis is sometimes called end-stage liver disease because it happens after other stages of damage from conditions that affect the liver, such as hepatitis. Your liver may keep working even when you have cirrhosis. However, cirrhosis can eventually lead to liver failure, and you can get serious complications, which can be life threatening. Treatment may be able to stop cirrhosis from getting worse. You may not have any symptoms during the early stages of cirrhosis. As your liver becomes more damaged, you may: If cirrhosis gets worse, some of the symptoms and complications include: See a GP if you think you may have cirrhosis. If a GP suspects cirrhosis, they'll check your medical history and do a physical examination to look for signs of long-term liver disease. You may have tests to confirm the diagnosis, such as: If tests show that you have cirrhosis, a GP should refer you to see a doctor who specialises in liver problems (hepatologist). If you have complications from cirrhosis, or a high chance of getting complications, you may be referred to a specialist liver centre. There's no cure for cirrhosis at the moment. However, there are ways to manage the symptoms and any complications and slow its progression. Treating the problem that led to cirrhosis (for example, using anti-viral medicines to treat hepatitis C) can stop cirrhosis getting worse. You may be advised to cut down or stop drinking alcohol, or to lose weight if you're overweight.  A GP can help you get support if you need help to stop drinking or to lose weight. If your liver is severely damaged, a liver transplant may be the only treatment option. In the UK, the most common causes of cirrhosis are: Cirrhosis can also be caused by a problem affecting your bile ducts (such as primary biliary cholangitis) or immune system (such as autoimmune hepatitis), some inherited conditions, and the long-term use of certain medicines. Drinking too much alcohol damages the liver. Over time, this can lead to alcohol-related liver disease. Cirrhosis is the final stage of alcohol-related liver disease. It usually happens after many years of heavy drinking. The best way to prevent alcohol-related cirrhosis is to drink within the recommended limits. The guidelines recommend: Stop drinking alcohol immediately if you have alcohol-related cirrhosis. Drinking alcohol speeds up the rate at which cirrhosis progresses, regardless of the cause. A GP can offer help and advice if you're finding it difficult to cut down the amount you drink.  Read more about where to get alcohol support. Hepatitis B and C are infections in the liver caused by a virus. The hepatitis B virus is spread in blood and body fluids. The hepatitis C virus is usually spread in blood. Common ways of spreading these viruses include having sex with an infected person without using a condom, or close contact with an infected person's blood, such as sharing their toothbrush or sharing needles to inject drugs. Vaccination for hepatitis B is part of the NHS childhood vaccination schedule. The vaccine is also available to anyone who has an increased chance of getting hepatitis B. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C at the moment. To reduce your chance of getting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which can lead to cirrhosis, make sure you're a healthy weight by eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly. The liver is an important organ that does hundreds of jobs that are vital for sustaining life. For example, the liver: Your liver is very tough. It'll keep working even when it's damaged and can continue to repair itself until it's severely damaged. In this video, Phil talks about why he was shocked to discover he had cirrhosis.

"Cirrhosis, also known as liver cirrhosis or hepatic cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease, is a condition of the liver in which the normal functioning tissue, or parenchyma, is replaced with scar tissue (fibrosis) and regenerative nodules as a result of chronic liver disease.[6][7][8]  Damage to the liver leads to repair of liver tissue and subsequent formation of scar tissue. Over time, scar tissue and nodules of regenerating hepatocytes can replace the parenchyma, causing increased resistance to blood flow in the liver's capillaries—the hepatic sinusoids[9]: 83 —and consequently portal hypertension, as well as impairment in other aspects of liver function.[6][10]  The disease typically develops slowly over months or years.[1]
 Stages of cirrhosis include compensated cirrhosis and decompensated cirrhosis.[11][12]: 110–111   Early symptoms may include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, nausea and vomiting, and discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.[13] As the disease worsens, symptoms may include itchiness, swelling in the lower legs, fluid build-up in the abdomen, jaundice, bruising easily, and the development of spider-like blood vessels in the skin.[13] The fluid build-up in the abdomen may develop into spontaneous infections.[1] More serious complications include hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus, stomach, or intestines, and liver cancer.[14]
 Cirrhosis is most commonly caused by alcohol-related liver disease, metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH – the progressive form of metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease,[15] previously called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD[16]), heroin abuse,[17] chronic hepatitis B, and chronic hepatitis C.[13][18] Heavy drinking over a number of years can cause alcoholic liver disease.[19] Liver damage has also been attributed to heroin usage over an extended period of time as well.[20] MASH has a number of causes, including obesity, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.[21] Less common causes of cirrhosis include autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis that disrupts bile duct function, genetic disorders such as Wilson's disease and hereditary hemochromatosis, and chronic heart failure with liver congestion.[13]
 Diagnosis is based on blood tests, medical imaging, and liver biopsy.[2][1]
 Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B and the development of cirrhosis from it, but no vaccination against hepatitis C is available.[1] No specific treatment for cirrhosis is known, but many of the underlying causes may be treated by a number of medications that may slow or prevent worsening of the condition.[3]  Hepatitis B and C may be treatable with antiviral medications.[1] Avoiding alcohol is recommended in all cases.[1] Autoimmune hepatitis may be treated with steroid medications.[1] Ursodiol may be useful if the disease is due to blockage of the bile duct.[1] Other medications may be useful for complications such as abdominal or leg swelling, hepatic encephalopathy, and dilated esophageal veins.[1] If cirrhosis leads to liver failure, a liver transplant may be an option.[21]  Biannual screening for liver cancer using abdominal ultrasound, possibly with additional blood tests, is recommended[22][23] due to the high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma arising from dysplastic nodules.[24]
 Cirrhosis affected about 2.8 million people and resulted in 1.3 million deaths in 2015.[4][5] Of these deaths, alcohol caused 348,000 (27%), hepatitis C caused 326,000 (25%), and hepatitis B caused 371,000 (28%).[5] In the United States, more men die of cirrhosis than women.[1] The first known description of the condition is by Hippocrates in the fifth century BCE.[25] The term ""cirrhosis"" was derived in 1819 from the Greek word ""kirrhos"", which describes the yellowish color of a diseased liver.[26]
 Cirrhosis can take quite a long time to develop, and symptoms may be slow to emerge.[13] Some early symptoms include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea.[13] Early signs may also include redness on the palms known as palmer erythema.[11] People may also feel discomfort in the right upper abdomen around the liver.[13]
 As cirrhosis progresses, symptoms can include neurological changes.[13] This can consist of cognitive impairments, confusion, memory loss, sleep disorders, and personality changes.[13]Steatorrhea or presence of undigested fats in stool is also a symptom of cirrhosis.[27]
 Worsening cirrhosis can cause a build-up of fluid in different parts of the body such as the legs (edema) and abdomen (ascites).[13] Other signs of advancing disease include itchy skin, bruising easily, dark urine, and yellowing of the skin.[13]
 These features are a direct consequence of liver cells not functioning:
 Liver cirrhosis makes it hard for blood to flow in the portal venous system.[38] This resistance creates a backup of blood and increases pressure.[38] This results in portal hypertension. Effects of portal hypertension include:
 Some signs that may be present include changes in the nails (such as Muehrcke's lines, Terry's nails, and nail clubbing).[42][43] Additional changes may be seen in the hands (Dupuytren's contracture) as well as the skin/bones (hypertrophic osteoarthropathy).[32]
 As the disease progresses, complications may develop. In some people, these may be the first signs of the disease.
 Cirrhosis has many possible causes, and more than one cause may be present. History taking is of importance in trying to determine the most likely cause.[2] Globally, 57% of cirrhosis is attributable to either hepatitis B (30%) or hepatitis C (27%).[46][47] Alcohol use disorder is another major cause, accounting for about 20–40% of the cases.[47][32]
 The liver plays a vital role in the synthesis of proteins (for example, albumin, clotting factors and complement), detoxification, and storage (for example, of vitamin A and glycogen). In addition, it participates in the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates.[citation needed]
 Cirrhosis is often preceded by hepatitis and fatty liver (steatosis), independent of the cause. If the cause is removed at this stage, the changes are fully reversible.[citation needed]
 The pathological hallmark of cirrhosis is the development of scar tissue that replaces normal tissue, which is normally organized into lobules. This scar tissue blocks the portal flow of blood through the organ, raising the blood pressure and disturbing normal function. Research has shown the pivotal role of the stellate cell, that normally stores vitamin A, in the development of cirrhosis. Damage to the liver tissue from inflammation leads to the activation of stellate cells, which increases fibrosis through the production of myofibroblasts, and obstructs hepatic blood flow.[57] In addition, stellate cells secrete TGF beta 1, which leads to a fibrotic response and proliferation of connective tissue. TGF-β1 have been implicated in the process of activating hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) with the magnitude of fibrosis being in proportion to increase in TGF β levels.  ACTA2 is associated with TGF β pathway that enhances contractile properties of HSCs leading to fibrosis.[58] Furthermore, HSCs secrete TIMP1 and TIMP2, naturally occurring inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which prevent MMPs from breaking down the fibrotic material in the extracellular matrix.[59][60]
 As this cascade of processes continues, fibrous tissue bands (septa) separate hepatocyte nodules, which eventually replace the entire liver architecture, leading to decreased blood flow throughout. The spleen becomes congested, and enlarged, resulting in its retention of platelets, which are needed for normal blood clotting. Portal hypertension is responsible for the most severe complications of cirrhosis.[citation needed]
 The diagnosis of cirrhosis in an individual is based on multiple factors.[32] Cirrhosis may be suspected from laboratory findings, physical exam, and the person's medical history. Imaging is generally obtained to evaluate the liver.[32] A liver biopsy will confirm the diagnosis; however, is generally not required.[44]
 Ultrasound is routinely used in the evaluation of cirrhosis.[44] It may show a small and shrunken liver in advanced disease.  On ultrasound, there is increased echogenicity with irregular appearing areas.[61] Other suggestive findings are an enlarged caudate lobe, widening of the fissures and enlargement of the spleen.[62] An enlarged spleen, which normally measures less than 11–12 cm (4.3–4.7 in) in adults, may suggest underlying portal hypertension.[63] Ultrasound may also screen for hepatocellular carcinoma and portal hypertension.[44] This is done by assessing flow in the hepatic vein.[64] An increased portal vein pulsatility may be seen. However, this may be a sign of elevated right atrial pressure.[65] Portal vein pulsatility are usually measured by a pulsatility indices (PI).[64] A number above a certain values indicates cirrhosis (see table below).
 Other scans include CT of the abdomen and MRI.[44] A CT scan is non-invasive and may be helpful in the diagnosis.[44] Compared to the ultrasound, CT scans tend to be more expensive. MRI provides excellent evaluation; however, is a high expense.[44]
 Cirrhosis is also diagnosable through a variety of new elastography techniques.[68][69] When a liver becomes cirrhotic it will generally become stiffer. Determining the stiffness through imaging can determine the location and severity of disease. Techniques include transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging, supersonic shear imaging and magnetic resonance elastography.[70] Transient elastography and magnetic resonance elastography can help identify the stage of fibrosis.[71] Compared to a biopsy, elastography can sample a much larger area and is painless.[72] It shows a reasonable correlation with the severity of cirrhosis.[71] Other modalities have been introduced which are incorporated into ultrasonagraphy systems. These include 2-dimensional shear wave elastography and point shear wave elastography which uses acoustic radiation force impulse imaging.[16]
 Rarely are diseases of the bile ducts, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, causes of cirrhosis.[44] Imaging of the bile ducts, such as ERCP or MRCP (MRI of biliary tract and pancreas) may aid in the diagnosis.[44]
 The best predictors of cirrhosis are ascites, platelet count < 160,000/mm3, spider angiomata, and a Bonacini cirrhosis discriminant score greater than 7 (as the sum of scores for platelet count, ALT/AST ratio and INR as per table).[73]
 These findings are typical in cirrhosis:
 FibroTest is a biomarker for fibrosis that may be used instead of a biopsy.[78]
 Other laboratory studies performed in newly diagnosed cirrhosis may include:
 Markers of inflammation and immune cell activation are typically elevated in cirrhotic patients, especially in the decompensated disease stage:
 A recent study identified 15 microbial biomarkers from the gut microbiota.[86] These could potentially be used to discriminate patients with liver cirrhosis from healthy individuals.
 The gold standard for diagnosis of cirrhosis is a liver biopsy. This is usually carried out as a fine-needle approach, through the skin (percutaneous), or internal jugular vein (transjugular).[87] Endoscopic ultrasound-guided liver biopsy (EUS), using the percutaneous or transjugular route, has become a good alternative to use.[88][87] EUS can target liver areas that are widely separated,[89] and can deliver bi-lobar biopsies.[88] A biopsy is not necessary if the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data suggest cirrhosis. Furthermore, a small but significant risk of complications is associated with liver biopsy, and cirrhosis itself predisposes for complications caused by liver biopsy.[90]
 Once the biopsy is obtained, a pathologist will study the sample. Cirrhosis is defined by its features on microscopy: (1) the presence of regenerating nodules of hepatocytes and (2) the presence of fibrosis, or the deposition of connective tissue between these nodules. The pattern of fibrosis seen can depend on the underlying insult that led to cirrhosis. Fibrosis can also proliferate even if the underlying process that caused it has resolved or ceased. The fibrosis in cirrhosis can lead to destruction of other normal tissues in the liver: including the sinusoids, the space of Disse, and other vascular structures, which leads to altered resistance to blood flow in the liver, and portal hypertension.[91]
 As cirrhosis can be caused by many different entities which injure the liver in different ways, cause-specific abnormalities may be seen. For example, in chronic hepatitis B, there is infiltration of the liver parenchyma with lymphocytes.[91] In congestive hepatopathy there are erythrocytes and a greater amount of fibrosis in the tissue surrounding the hepatic veins.[93] In primary biliary cholangitis, there is fibrosis around the bile duct, the presence of granulomas and pooling of bile.[94] Lastly in alcoholic cirrhosis, there is infiltration of the liver with neutrophils.[91]
 Macroscopically, the liver is initially enlarged, but with the progression of the disease, it becomes smaller. Its surface is irregular, the consistency is firm, and if associated with steatosis the color is yellow. Depending on the size of the nodules, there are three macroscopic types: micronodular, macronodular, and mixed cirrhosis. In the micronodular form (Laennec's cirrhosis or portal cirrhosis), regenerating nodules are under 3 mm. In macronodular cirrhosis (post-necrotic cirrhosis), the nodules are larger than 3 mm. Mixed cirrhosis consists of nodules of different sizes.[95]
 The severity of cirrhosis is commonly classified with the Child–Pugh score (also known as the Child–Pugh–Turcotte score).[96] This system was devised in 1964 by Child and Turcotte, and modified in 1973 by Pugh and others.[97] It was first established to determine who would benefit from elective surgery for portal decompression.[96]  This scoring system uses multiple lab values including bilirubin, albumin, and INR.[98] The presence of ascites and severity of encephalopathy is also included in the scoring.[98] The classification system includes class A, B, or C.[98] Class A has a favorable prognosis while class C is at high risk of death.
 The Child-Pugh score is a validated predictor of mortality after a major surgery.[96] For example, Child class A patients have a 10% mortality rate and Child class B patients have a 30% mortality rate while Child class C patients have a 70–80% mortality rate after abdominal surgery.[96] Elective surgery is usually reserved for those in Child class A patients. There is an increased risk for child class B individuals and they may require medical optimization. Overall, it is not recommended for Child class C patients to undergo elective surgery.[96]
 In the past, the Child-Pugh classification was used to determine people who were candidates for a liver transplant.[96] Child-Pugh class B is usually an indication for evaluation for transplant.[98] However, there were many issues when applying this score to liver transplant eligibility.[96] Thus, the MELD score was created.
 The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was later developed and approved in 2002.[99] It was approved by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) as a way to determine the allocation of liver transplants to awaiting people in the United States.[100] It is also used as a validated survival predictor of cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, acute liver failure, and acute hepatitis.[101] The variables included bilirubin, INR, creatinine, and dialysis frequency.[101] In 2016, sodium was added to the variables and the score is often referred to as MELD-Na.[102]
 MELD-Plus is a further risk score to assess severity of chronic liver disease. It was developed in 2017 as a result of a collaboration between Massachusetts General Hospital and IBM.[103] Nine variables were identified as effective predictors for 90-day mortality after a discharge from a cirrhosis-related hospital admission.[103] The variables include all Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)'s components, as well as sodium, albumin, total cholesterol, white blood cell count, age, and length of stay.[103]
 The hepatic venous pressure gradient (difference in venous pressure between incoming and outgoing blood to the liver) also determines the severity of cirrhosis, although it is hard to measure. A value of 16 mm or more means a greatly increased risk of death.[104][unreliable medical source?]
 Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.[105]
 Little is known about factors affecting cirrhosis risk and progression. However, many studies have provided increasing evidence for the protective effects of coffee consumption against the progression of liver disease. These effects are more noticeable in liver disease that is associated with alcohol use disorder. Coffee has antioxidant and antifibrotic effects. Caffeine may not be the important component; polyphenols may be more important. Drinking two or more cups of coffee a day is associated with improvements in the liver enzymes ALT, AST, and GGT. Even in those with liver disease, coffee consumption can lower fibrosis and cirrhosis.[106]
 Generally, liver damage from cirrhosis cannot be reversed, but treatment can stop or delay further progression and reduce complications. A healthy diet is encouraged, as cirrhosis may be an energy-consuming process. A recommended diet consists of high-protein, high-fiber diet plus supplementation with branched-chain amino acids.[107] Close follow-up is often necessary. Antibiotics are prescribed for infections, and various medications can help with itching. Laxatives, such as lactulose, decrease the risk of constipation. Carvedilol increases survival benefit for people with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.[108] 
Diuretics in combination with low salt diet reduce fluid in body which helps reduce oedema.[109]
 Alcoholic cirrhosis caused by alcohol use disorder is treated by abstaining from alcohol. Treatment for hepatitis-related cirrhosis involves medications used to treat the different types of hepatitis, such as interferon for viral hepatitis and corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis.[citation needed]
 Cirrhosis caused by Wilson's disease is treated by removing the copper which builds up in organs.[2] This is carried out using chelation therapy such as penicillamine. When the cause is an iron overload, iron is removed using a chelation agent such as deferoxamine or by bloodletting.[citation needed]
 As of 2021, there are recent studies studying drugs to prevent cirrhosis caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD or NASH). A drug called semaglutide was shown to provide greater NASH resolution versus placebo. No improvement in fibrosis was observed.[110] A combination of cilofexor/firsocostat was studied in people with bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis. It was observed to have led to improvements in NASH activity with a potential antifibrotic effect.[111] Lanifibranor is also shown to prevent worsening fibrosis.[112]
 Regardless of the underlying cause of cirrhosis, consumption of alcohol and other potentially damaging substances is discouraged. There is no evidence that supports the avoidance or dose reduction of paracetamol in people with compensated cirrhosis; it is thus considered a safe analgesic for said individuals.[113]
 Vaccination against hepatitis A and hepatitis B is recommended early in the course of illness due to decline in effectiveness of the vaccines with decompensation.[114]
 Treating the cause of cirrhosis prevents further damage; for example, giving oral antivirals such as entecavir and tenofovir where cirrhosis is due to hepatitis B prevents progression of cirrhosis. Similarly, control of weight and diabetes prevents deterioration in cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.[115]
 People with cirrhosis or liver damage are often advised to avoid drugs that could further harm the liver.[116] These include several drugs such as anti-depressants, certain antibiotics, and NSAIDs (like ibuprofen).[116] These agents are hepatotoxic as they are metabolized by the liver. If a medication that harms the liver is still recommended by a doctor, the dosage can be adjusted to aim for minimal stress on the liver.[citation needed]
 According to a 2018 systematic review based on studies that implemented 8 to 14 week-long exercise programs, there is currently insufficient scientific evidence regarding either the beneficial or harmful effects of physical exercise in people with cirrhosis on all-cause mortality, morbidity (including both serious and non-serious adverse events), health-related quality of life, exercise capacity and anthropomorphic measures.[117] These conclusions were based on low to very low quality research, which imposes the need to develop further research with higher quality, especially to evaluate its effects on clinical outcomes.[citation needed]
 If complications cannot be controlled or when the liver ceases functioning, liver transplantation is necessary. Survival from liver transplantation has been improving over the 1990s, and the five-year survival rate is now around 80%. The survival rate depends largely on the severity of disease and other medical risk factors in the recipient.[118] In the United States, the MELD score is used to prioritize patients for transplantation.[119] Transplantation necessitates the use of immune suppressants (ciclosporin or tacrolimus).
 Manifestations of decompensation in cirrhosis include gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice or ascites. In patients with previously stable cirrhosis, decompensation may occur due to various causes, such as constipation, infection (of any source), increased alcohol intake, medication, bleeding from esophageal varices or dehydration. It may take the form of any of the complications of cirrhosis listed below.
 People with decompensated cirrhosis generally require admission to a hospital, with close monitoring of the fluid balance, mental status, and emphasis on adequate nutrition and medical treatment – often with diuretics, antibiotics, laxatives or enemas, thiamine and occasionally steroids, acetylcysteine and pentoxifylline.[120] Administration of saline is avoided, as it would add to the already high total body sodium content that typically occurs in cirrhosis. Life expectancy without liver transplant is low, at most three years.
 Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing patients with relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of a serious illness, such as cirrhosis. The goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the patient's family and it is appropriate at any stage and for any type of cirrhosis.[121]
 Especially in the later stages, people with cirrhosis experience significant symptoms such as abdominal swelling, itching, leg edema, and chronic abdominal pain which would be amenable for treatment through palliative care.[122] Because the disease is not curable without a transplant, palliative care can also help with discussions regarding the person's wishes concerning health care power of attorney, do not resuscitate decisions and life support, and potentially hospice.[122] Despite proven benefit, people with cirrhosis are rarely referred to palliative care.[123]
 Cirrhosis is known to cause immune dysfunction in numerous ways. It impedes the immune system from working normally.[citation needed]
 Cirrhosis can increase the risk of bleeding. The liver produces various proteins in the coagulation cascade (coagulation factors II, VII, IX, X, V, and VI). When damaged, the liver is impaired in its production of these proteins.[124] This will ultimately increase bleeding as clotting factors are diminished. Clotting function is estimated by lab values, mainly platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), and international normalized ratio (INR).
 The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) provided recommendations in 2021 in regards to coagulopathy management of cirrhotic patients in certain scenarios.[124]
 Salt restriction is often necessary, as cirrhosis leads to accumulation of salt (sodium retention). Diuretics may be necessary to suppress ascites. Diuretic options for inpatient treatment include aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone) and loop diuretics. Aldosterone antagonists are preferred for people who can take oral medications and are not in need of an urgent volume reduction. Loop diuretics can be added as additional therapy.[125]
 Where salt restriction and the use of diuretics are ineffective then paracentesis may be the preferred option.[126] This procedure requires the insertion of a plastic tube into the peritoneal cavity. Human serum albumin solution is usually given to prevent complications from the rapid volume reduction. In addition to being more rapid than diuretics, 4–5 liters of paracentesis is more successful in comparison to diuretic therapy.[125]
 For portal hypertension, nonselective beta blockers such as propranolol or nadolol are commonly used to lower blood pressure over the portal system. In severe complications from portal hypertension, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) is occasionally indicated to relieve pressure on the portal vein. As this shunting can worsen hepatic encephalopathy, it is reserved for those patients at low risk of encephalopathy. TIPS is generally regarded only as a bridge to liver transplantation[127] or as a palliative measure.[citation needed] Balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration can be used to treat gastric variceal bleeding.[128]
 Gastroscopy (endoscopic examination of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum) is performed in cases of established cirrhosis. If esophageal varices are found, prophylactic local therapy may be applied such as sclerotherapy or banding, and beta blockers may be used.[129][130][131]
 Hepatic encephalopathy is a potential complication of cirrhosis.[32] It may lead to functional neurological impairment ranging from mild confusion to coma.[32] Hepatic encephalopathy is primarily caused by the accumulation of ammonia in the blood, which causes neurotoxicity when crossing the blood-brain barrier. Ammonia is normally metabolized by the liver; as cirrhosis causes both decreased liver function and increased portosystemic shunting (allowing blood to bypass the liver), systemic ammonia levels gradually rise and lead to encephalopathy.[132]
 Most pharmaceutical approaches to treating hepatic encephalopathy focus on reducing ammonia levels.[133] Per 2014 guidelines,[134] the first-line treatment involves the use of lactulose, a non-absorbable disaccharide which decreases the pH level of the colon when it is metabolized by intestinal bacteria. The lower colonic pH causes increased conversion of ammonia into ammonium, which is then excreted from the body.[135] Rifaximin, an antibiotic that inhibits the function of ammonia-producing bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract,[136] is recommended for use in combination with lactulose as prophylaxis against recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy.[134][137][138]
 In addition to pharmacotherapy, providing proper hydration and nutritional support is also essential.[133] Appropriate quantities of protein uptake is encouraged.[139] Several factors may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy, which include alcohol use, excess protein, gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, constipation, and vomiting/diarrhea.[133] Drugs such as benzodiazepines, diuretics, or narcotics can also precipitate encephalopathic events.[133] A low protein diet is recommended with gastrointestinal bleeding.[139]
 The severity of hepatic encephalopathy is determined by assessing the patient's mental status. This is generally a subjective assessment, although several attempts at creating criteria to help standardize this assessment have been published. One example is the West Haven criteria, reproduced below.
 Hepatorenal syndrome is a serious complication of end-stage cirrhosis when kidney damage is also involved.[141]
 People with ascites due to cirrhosis are at risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
 Portal hypertensive gastropathy refers to changes in the mucosa of the stomach in people with portal hypertension, and is associated with cirrhosis severity.[142]
 Cirrhosis can cause immune system dysfunction, leading to infection. Signs and symptoms of infection may be nonspecific and are more difficult to recognize (for example, worsening encephalopathy but no fever).[143] Moreover, infections in cirrhosis are major triggers for other complications (ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, organ failures, death).[143][83][85]
 Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary liver cancer, and the most common cause of death in people with cirrhosis.[144] Screening using an MRI scan can detect this cancer and is often carried out for early signs which has been shown to improve outcomes.[2][145]
 Each year, approximately one million deaths are due to complications of cirrhosis, making cirrhosis the 11th most common cause of death globally.[147] Cirrhosis and chronic liver disease were the tenth leading cause of death for men and the twelfth for women in the United States in 2001, killing about 27,000 people each year.[148]
 The cause of cirrhosis can vary; alcohol and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are main causes in western and industrialized countries, whereas viral hepatitis is the predominant cause in low and middle-income countries.[147] Cirrhosis is more common in men than in women.[149] The cost of cirrhosis in terms of human suffering, hospital costs, and lost productivity is high.
 Globally, age-standardized disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates have decreased from 1990 to 2017, with the values going from 656.4 years per 100,000 people to 510.7 years per 100,000 people.[150] In males DALY rates have decreased from 903.1 years per 100,000 population in 1990, to 719.3 years per 100,000 population in 2017; in females the DALY rates have decreased from 415.5 years per 100,000 population in 1990, to 307.6 years per 100,000 population in 2017.[150] However, globally the total number of DALYs have increased by 10.9 million from 1990 to 2017, reaching the value of 41.4 million DALYs.[150]
 The word ""cirrhosis"" is a neologism derived from Greek: κίρρωσις; kirrhos κιρρός, meaning ""yellowish, tawny"" (the orange yellow colour of the diseased liver) and the suffix -osis, i.e. ""condition"" in medical terminology.[151][152][153] While the clinical entity was known before, René Laennec gave it this name in an 1819 paper.[26]

"Cirrhosis of the liver is permanent scarring that damages your liver and interferes with its functioning. It can lead to liver failure. Cirrhosis is the result of persistent liver damage over many years. Alcohol and drugs, viruses and metabolic factors are the most common causes. Cirrhosis of the liver is late stage liver disease, in which healthy liver tissue has been gradually replaced with scar tissue. This is a result of long-term, chronic hepatitis. Hepatitis is inflammation in your liver, which has many causes. When inflammation is ongoing, your liver attempts to repair itself by scarring. But too much scar tissue prevents your liver from working properly. The end stage is chronic liver failure. Cirrhosis is a progressive condition that worsens as more and more scar tissue develops. In the beginning, your body adjusts to compensate for your reduced liver function, and you might not notice it too much. This is known as compensated cirrhosis. Eventually, though, as your liver function declines further, you will begin to experience noticeable symptoms. This is known as decompensated cirrhosis. Scarring in your liver blocks the flow of blood and oxygen through your liver tissues. This slows your liver's ability to process your blood, metabolize nutrients and filter out toxins. Cirrhosis reduces your liver's ability to produce bile and essential blood proteins. Scar tissue can also compress blood vessels running through your liver, including the important portal vein system, leading to a condition called portal hypertension. Cirrhosis is relatively common and is a significant cause of hospitalization and death, especially after middle age. That’s because it develops gradually over time. In the United States, cirrhosis affects about 0.25% of all adults and about 0.50% of adults between the ages of 45 and 54. Each year, about 26,000 deaths in the United States are attributed to cirrhosis, and these rates are rising. Cirrhosis is a global health concern. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Signs and symptoms of cirrhosis depend on how advanced it is. You might not have symptoms at all early on, or you might only have vague symptoms that resemble many other conditions. Symptoms of cirrhosis become more recognizable as your liver function declines. For example, you might see signs that bile isn’t traveling where it needs to go, and instead is overflowing into places it doesn’t belong. Early signs and symptoms of cirrhosis may include: Recognizable symptoms of cirrhosis fall into two categories: symptoms related to declining liver function, and symptoms related to portal hypertension. Symptoms of stalled bile flow, like jaundice, are common indicators of declining liver function. Symptoms of portal hypertension indicate cirrhosis specifically. It’s scar tissue in your liver that compresses your portal vein. Cirrhosis symptoms related to declining liver function include: Cirrhosis symptoms related to portal hypertension include: Cirrhosis is a gradual scarring process that’s triggered by chronic inflammation in your liver. Any chronic liver disease that causes chronic hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis. The most common causes include: Less common causes of cirrhosis include: You might be at higher risk for cirrhosis of the liver if you: Advertisement Downstream effects of cirrhosis and portal hypertension include: Life-threatening complications of cirrhosis and portal hypertension can include: A healthcare provider will begin by physically examining you for signs and symptoms of cirrhosis of the liver. They’ll ask you about when your symptoms began and whether they’ve changed over time. They’ll also ask questions about your medical history, what medications, herbs or supplements you take, and your diet and lifestyle. They’ll look for clues that might suggest a history of liver disease or liver damage. They’ll follow up with medical tests to look for evidence of cirrhosis of the liver. Tests may include: Advertisement Cirrhosis involves permanent scarring in your liver, which can’t be undone. While your liver has great healing powers in general, cirrhosis is a stage of disease where it doesn’t have enough healthy cells left to heal itself with. But you may be able to slow or stop cirrhosis from progressing further. This depends on what’s causing it, how treatable the cause is, and how well you respond to the treatment. Treatment for cirrhosis of the liver includes: Medications can treat certain types of liver diseases, with varying levels of success. For example, antivirals can cure chronic hepatitis C but only suppress (not cure) chronic hepatitis B. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants can help manage some autoimmune diseases, but not all. Other medications can reverse the effects of certain inherited diseases but may only treat the symptoms of others. If you have toxic or alcohol-related liver disease, eliminating those toxins from your life is the only treatment. To manage this, some people may need treatment for a substance use disorder. If you have nonalcohol-related liver disease, managing metabolic factors like cholesterol, blood sugar and overweight can help relieve it. Some people may need medications to help manage these factors. Even if your liver disease is from other factors, eliminating alcohol and drugs that damage your liver will help preserve your liver longer. The same is true of metabolic stress factors. Healthcare providers recommend that anyone with any type of liver disease should try to maintain eat healthy foods and achieve a weight that's healthy for you. In addition, some people might need dietary supplements to treat nutritional deficiencies. Once your healthcare provider has diagnosed cirrhosis, they’ll also check for common side effects. Portal hypertension is the most common side effect and comes with its own set of complications, each requiring specific treatments. You might need: Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) is another possible complication of cirrhosis. Not everyone with cirrhosis develops liver cancer, but most people who do develop liver cancer have cirrhosis. If you develop cancer with cirrhosis, your provider might treat it with cancer therapies like radiation or chemotherapy. Or they might judge that the best solution is a complete liver transplant. Healthcare providers recommend liver transplantation when they feel that your health will continue to decline without one. This might be the case if you are in active liver failure, have liver cancer and/or you aren’t responding to treatment for your liver disease. If you meet the qualifications for a liver transplant, you’ll join a national waiting list to receive one. Your condition will determine your place on the list. You might be able to prevent liver disease from progressing to cirrhosis by intervening earlier in the process. This depends on whether you’re aware of it and whether there are steps you can take to prevent it. Many people don’t have symptoms in the early stages, but a routine health checkup could help bring it to light. This could give you the chance to make important changes or begin treatment. Once you have cirrhosis, your liver won’t get better. But it won’t necessarily get worse. If you still have compensated cirrhosis with little to no symptoms or side effects, you may continue that way for some time. If you can stop or minimize the inflammation causing cirrhosis, it may not progress to the decompensated stage. But you'll have to continue to protect your liver for the rest of your life. Life expectancy with cirrhosis varies widely, depending on many factors, including: Healthcare providers use scoring methods like the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) system and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) to forecast your prognosis and determine your place on the liver transplant waiting list. These scores are based on your liver function test results and whether you have complications like ascites or hepatic encephalopathy, which would indicate decompensated cirrhosis. In the early stages of compensated cirrhosis, life expectancy may still be upwards of 15 years. When portal hypertension develops, it reduces that expectancy, primarily due to the risk of internal bleeding it can cause. Decompensated cirrhosis has an average life expectancy of seven years. Severe, untreatable diseases and other complications can speed up that timeline. Some people have less than two years. You can help extend the life of your liver by: A note from Cleveland Clinic Cirrhosis of the liver befalls all sorts of people for all sorts of reasons.

 Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine).[5] Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, abdominal pain and fatigue.[9] Most colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors, with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders.[2][3] Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity.[2] Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol.[2][4] Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.[2] Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases.[2][3] It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous.[2]
 Colorectal cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.[1] This is then followed by medical imaging to determine whether the disease has spread.[5] Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer.[10] Screening, by one of a number of methods, is recommended starting from the age of 45 to 75. It was recommended starting at age 50 but it was changed to 45 due to increasing amount of colon cancers.[10][11] During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found.[2] If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk of pain during polyp excision.[2][12] Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects.[13]
 Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.[5] Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery, while cancer that has spread widely is usually not curable, with management being directed towards improving quality of life and symptoms.[5] The five-year survival rate in the United States was around 65% in 2014.[6] The individual likelihood of survival depends on how advanced the cancer is, whether or not all the cancer can be removed with surgery, and the person's overall health.[1] Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer, making up about 10% of all cases.[14] In 2018, there were 1.09 million new cases and 551,000 deaths from the disease.[8] It is more common in developed countries, where more than 65% of cases are found.[2] It is less common in women than men.[2]
 The signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer depend on the location of the tumor in the bowel, and whether it has spread elsewhere in the body (metastasis). The classic warning signs include: worsening constipation, blood in the stool, decrease in stool caliber (thickness), loss of appetite, loss of weight, and nausea or vomiting in someone over 50 years old.[15] Around 50% of people who have colorectal cancer do not report any symptoms.[16]
 Rectal bleeding or anemia are high-risk symptoms in people over the age of 50.[17] Weight loss and changes in a person's bowel habit are typically only concerning if they are associated with rectal bleeding.[17][18]
 75–95% of colorectal cancer cases occur in people with little or no genetic risk.[19][20] Risk factors include older age, male sex,[20] high intake of fat, sugar, alcohol, red meat, processed meats, obesity, smoking, and a lack of physical exercise.[19][21] The Rectal Cancer Survival Calculator developed by the MD Anderson Cancer Center additionally considers race to be a risk factor; however, there are equity issues concerning whether this might lead to inequity in clinical decision making.[22][23] Approximately 10% of cases are linked to insufficient activity.[24] The risk from alcohol appears to increase at greater than one drink per day.[25] Drinking five glasses of water a day is linked to a decrease in the risk of colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps.[26] Streptococcus gallolyticus is associated with colorectal cancer.[27] Some strains of Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex are consumed by millions of people daily and thus may be safe.[28] 25 to 80% of people with Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors.[29] Seroprevalence of Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus is considered as a candidate practical marker for the early prediction of an underlying bowel lesion at high risk population.[29] It has been suggested that the presence of antibodies to Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus antigens or the antigens themselves in the bloodstream may act as markers for the carcinogenesis in the colon.[29]
 Pathogenic Escherichia coli may increase the risk of colorectal cancer by producing the genotoxic metabolite, colibactin.[30]
 People with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are at increased risk of colon cancer.[31][32] The risk increases the longer a person has the disease, and the worse the severity of inflammation.[33] In these high risk groups, both prevention with aspirin and regular colonoscopies are recommended.[34] Endoscopic surveillance in this high-risk population may reduce the development of colorectal cancer through early diagnosis and may also reduce the chances of dying from colon cancer.[34] People with inflammatory bowel disease account for less than 2% of colon cancer cases yearly.[33] In those with Crohn's disease, 2% get colorectal cancer after 10 years, 8% after 20 years, and 18% after 30 years.[33] In people who have ulcerative colitis, approximately 16% develop either a cancer precursor or cancer of the colon over 30 years.[33]
 Those with a family history in two or more first-degree relatives (such as a parent or sibling) have a two to threefold greater risk of disease, and this group accounts for about 20% of all cases. A number of genetic syndromes are also associated with higher rates of colorectal cancer. The most common of these is hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, or Lynch syndrome) which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer.[20] Other syndromes that are strongly associated with colorectal cancer include Gardner syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).[35] For people with these syndromes, cancer almost always occurs and makes up 1% of the cancer cases.[36] A total proctocolectomy may be recommended for people with FAP as a preventive measure due to the high risk of malignancy. Colectomy, removal of the colon, may not suffice as a preventive measure because of the high risk of rectal cancer if the rectum remains.[37] The most common polyposis syndrome affecting the colon is serrated polyposis syndrome,[38] which is associated with a 25-40% risk of CRC.[39]
 Mutations in the pair of genes (POLE and POLD1) have been associated with familial colon cancer.[40]
 Most deaths due to colon cancer are associated with metastatic disease. A gene that appears to contribute to the potential for metastatic disease, metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1), has been isolated.[41] It is a transcriptional factor that influences the expression of hepatocyte growth factor. This gene is associated with the proliferation, invasion, and scattering of colon cancer cells in cell culture, and tumor growth and metastasis in mice. MACC1 may be a potential target for cancer intervention, but this possibility needs to be confirmed with clinical studies.[42]
 Epigenetic factors, such as abnormal DNA methylation of tumor suppressor promoters, play a role in the development of colorectal cancer.[43]
 Ashkenazi Jews have a 6% higher risk rate of getting adenomas and then colon cancer due to mutations in the APC gene being more common.[44]
 Colorectal cancer is a disease originating from the epithelial cells lining the colon or rectum of the gastrointestinal tract, most frequently as a result of genetic mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway that increases signaling activity.[45] The Wnt signaling pathway normally plays an important role for normal function of these cells including maintaining this lining. Mutations can be inherited or acquired, and most probably occur in the intestinal crypt stem cell.[46][47][48] The most commonly mutated gene in all colorectal cancer is the APC gene, which produces the APC protein.[45] The APC protein prevents the accumulation of β-catenin protein. Without APC, β-catenin accumulates to high levels and translocates (moves) into the nucleus, binds to DNA, and activates the transcription of proto-oncogenes. These genes are normally important for stem cell renewal and differentiation, but when inappropriately expressed at high levels, they can cause cancer.[45] While APC is mutated in most colon cancers, some cancers have increased β-catenin because of mutations in β-catenin (CTNNB1) that block its own breakdown, or have mutations in other genes with function similar to APC such as AXIN1, AXIN2, TCF7L2, or NKD1.[49]
 Beyond the defects in the Wnt signaling pathway, other mutations must occur for the cell to become cancerous. The p53 protein, produced by the TP53 gene, normally monitors cell division and induces their programmed death if they have Wnt pathway defects. Eventually, a cell line acquires a mutation in the TP53 gene and transforms the tissue from a benign epithelial tumor into an invasive epithelial cell cancer. Sometimes the gene encoding p53 is not mutated, but another protective protein named BAX is mutated instead.[49]
 Other proteins responsible for programmed cell death that are commonly deactivated in colorectal cancers are TGF-β and DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer). TGF-β has a deactivating mutation in at least half of colorectal cancers. Sometimes TGF-β is not deactivated, but a downstream protein named SMAD is deactivated.[49] DCC commonly has a deleted segment of a chromosome in colorectal cancer.[50]
 Approximately 70% of all human genes are expressed in colorectal cancer, with just over 1% of having increased expression in colorectal cancer compared to other forms of cancer.[51] Some genes are oncogenes: they are overexpressed in colorectal cancer. For example, genes encoding the proteins KRAS, RAF, and PI3K, which normally stimulate the cell to divide in response to growth factors, can acquire mutations that result in over-activation of cell proliferation. The chronological order of mutations is sometimes important. If a previous APC mutation occurred, a primary KRAS mutation often progresses to cancer rather than a self-limiting hyperplastic or borderline lesion.[52] PTEN, a tumor suppressor, normally inhibits PI3K, but can sometimes become mutated and deactivated.[49]
 Comprehensive, genome-scale analysis has revealed that colorectal carcinomas can be categorized into hypermutated and non-hypermutated tumor types.[53] In addition to the oncogenic and inactivating mutations described for the genes above, non-hypermutated samples also contain mutated CTNNB1, FAM123B, SOX9, ATM, and ARID1A. Progressing through a distinct set of genetic events, hypermutated tumors display mutated forms of ACVR2A, TGFBR2, MSH3, MSH6, SLC9A9, TCF7L2, and BRAF. The common theme among these genes, across both tumor types, is their involvement in Wnt and TGF-β signaling pathways, which results in increased activity of MYC, a central player in colorectal cancer.[53]
 Mismatch repair (MMR) deficient tumours are characterized by a relatively high amount of poly-nucleotide tandem repeats.[54] This is caused by a deficiency in MMR proteins – which are typically caused by epigenetic silencing and or inherited mutations (e.g., Lynch syndrome).[55] 15 to 18 percent of colorectal cancer tumours have MMR deficiencies, with 3 percent developing due to Lynch syndrome.[56] The role of the mismatch repair system is to protect the integrity of the genetic material within cells (i.e., error detecting and correcting).[55] Consequently, a deficiency in MMR proteins may lead to an inability to detect and repair genetic damage, allowing for further cancer-causing mutations to occur and colorectal cancer to progress.[55]
 The polyp to cancer progression sequence is the classical model of colorectal cancer pathogenesis.[57] In this adenoma-carcinoma sequence,[58] normal epithelial cells progress to dysplastic cells such as adenomas, and then to carcinoma, by a process of progressive genetic mutation.[59] Central to the polyp to CRC sequence are gene mutations, epigenetic alterations, and local inflammatory changes.[57] The polyp to CRC sequence can be used as an underlying framework to illustrate how specific molecular changes lead to various cancer subtypes.[57]
 The term ""field cancerization"" was first used in 1953 to describe an area or ""field"" of epithelium that has been preconditioned (by what were largely unknown processes at the time) to predispose it towards development of cancer.[60] Since then, the terms ""field cancerization"", ""field carcinogenesis"", ""field defect"", and ""field effect"" have been used to describe pre-malignant or pre-neoplastic tissue in which new cancers are likely to arise.[61]
 Field defects are important in progression to colon cancer.[62][63]
 However, as pointed out by Rubin, ""The vast majority of studies in cancer research has been done on well-defined tumors in vivo, or on discrete neoplastic foci in vitro. Yet there is evidence that more than 80% of the somatic mutations found in mutator phenotype human colorectal tumors occur before the onset of terminal clonal expansion.""[64][65] Similarly, Vogelstein et al.[66] pointed out that more than half of somatic mutations identified in tumors occurred in a pre-neoplastic phase (in a field defect), during growth of apparently normal cells. Likewise, epigenetic alterations present in tumors may have occurred in pre-neoplastic field defects.[67]
 An expanded view of field effect has been termed ""etiologic field effect"", which encompasses not only molecular and pathologic changes in pre-neoplastic cells but also influences of exogenous environmental factors and molecular changes in the local microenvironment on neoplastic evolution from tumor initiation to death.[68]
 Epigenetic alterations are much more frequent in colon cancer than genetic (mutational) alterations. As described by Vogelstein et al.,[66] an average cancer of the colon has only 1 or 2 oncogene mutations and 1 to 5 tumor suppressor mutations (together designated ""driver mutations""), with about 60 further ""passenger"" mutations. The oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are well studied and are described above under Pathogenesis.[69][70]
 In addition to epigenetic alteration of expression of miRNAs, other common types of epigenetic alterations in cancers that change gene expression levels include direct hypermethylation or hypomethylation of CpG islands of protein-encoding genes and alterations in histones and chromosomal architecture that influence gene expression.[71] As an example, 147 hypermethylations and 27 hypomethylations of protein coding genes were frequently associated with colorectal cancers. Of the hypermethylated genes, 10 were hypermethylated in 100% of colon cancers, and many others were hypermethylated in more than 50% of colon cancers.[72] In addition, 11 hypermethylations and 96 hypomethylations of miRNAs were also associated with colorectal cancers.[72] Abnormal (aberrant) methylation occurs as a normal consequence of normal aging and the risk of colorectal cancer increases as a person gets older.[73] The source and trigger of this age-related methylation is unknown.[73][74] Approximately half of the genes that show age-related methylation changes are the same genes that have been identified to be involved in the development of colorectal cancer.[73] These findings may suggest a reason for age being associated with the increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.[73]
 Epigenetic reductions of DNA repair enzyme expression may likely lead to the genomic and epigenomic instability characteristic of cancer.[75][76][67] As summarized in the articles Carcinogenesis and Neoplasm, for sporadic cancers in general, a deficiency in DNA repair is occasionally due to a mutation in a DNA repair gene, but is much more frequently due to epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes.[77]
 Epigenetic alterations involved in the development of colorectal cancer may affect a person's response to chemotherapy.[78]
 Consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) classification of colorectal cancer was first introduced in 2015. CMS classification so far has been considered the most robust classification system available for CRC that has a clear biological interpretability and the basis for future clinical stratification and subtype-based targeted interventions.[79]
 A novel Epigenome-based Classification (EpiC) of colorectal cancer was proposed in 2021 introducing 4 enhancer subtypes in people with CRC. Chromatin states using 6 histone marks are characterized to identify EpiC subtypes. A combinatorial therapeutic approach based on the previously introduced consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) and EpiCs could significantly enhance current treatment strategies.[80]
 Colorectal cancer diagnosis is performed by sampling of areas of the colon suspicious for possible tumor development, typically during colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, depending on the location of the lesion.[20]
 A colorectal cancer is sometimes initially discovered on CT scan.[81]
 Presence of metastases is determined by a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.[20] Other potential imaging tests such as PET and MRI may be used in certain cases.[20] MRI is particularly useful to determine local stage of the tumor and to plan the optimal surgical approach.[81]
 MRI is also performed after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to identify patients who achieve complete response. Patients with complete response on both MRI and endoscopy may not require surgical resection and can avoid unnecessary surgical morbidity and complications.[82] Patients selected for non-surgical treatment of rectal cancer should have periodic MRI scans, receive physical examinations, and undergo endoscopy procedures to detect any tumor re-growth which can occur in a minority of these patients. When local recurrence occurs, periodic follow up can detect it when it is still small and curable with salvage surgery. In addition, MRI tumor regression grades can be assigned after chemoradiotherapy which correlate with patients' long-term survival outcomes.[83]
 The histopathologic characteristics of the tumor are reported from the analysis of tissue taken from a biopsy or surgery. A pathology report contains a description of the microscopical characteristics of the tumor tissue, including both tumor cells and how the tumor invades into healthy tissues and finally if the tumor appears to be completely removed. The most common form of colon cancer is adenocarcinoma, constituting between 95%[85] and 98%[86] of all cases of colorectal cancer. Other, rarer types include lymphoma, adenosquamous and squamous cell carcinoma. Some subtypes are more aggressive.[87] Immunohistochemistry may be used in uncertain cases.[88]
 Staging of the cancer is based on both radiological and pathological findings. As with most other forms of cancer, tumor staging is based on the TNM system which considers how much the initial tumor has spread and the presence of metastases in lymph nodes and more distant organs.[20] The AJCC 8th edition was published in 2018.[89]
 It has been estimated that about half of colorectal cancer cases are due to lifestyle factors, and about a quarter of all cases are preventable.[90] Increasing surveillance, engaging in physical activity, consuming a diet high in fiber, quitting smoking and limiting alcohol consumption decrease the risk.[91][92]
 Lifestyle risk factors with strong evidence include lack of exercise, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and obesity.[93][94][95] The risk of colon cancer can be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight through a combination of sufficient exercise and eating a healthy diet.[96]
 Current research consistently links eating more red meat and processed meat to a higher risk of the disease.[97] Starting in the 1970s, dietary recommendations to prevent colorectal cancer often included increasing the consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and reducing the intake of red meat and processed meats. This was based on animal studies and retrospective observational studies. However, large scale prospective studies have failed to demonstrate a significant protective effect, and due to the multiple causes of cancer and the complexity of studying correlations between diet and health, it is uncertain whether any specific dietary interventions will have significant protective effects.[98]: 432–433 [99]: 125–126  In 2018 the National Cancer Institute stated that ""There is no reliable evidence that a diet started in adulthood that is low in fat and meat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables reduces the risk of CRC by a clinically important degree.""[93][100]
 Consuming alcoholic drinks and consuming processed meat both increase the risk of colorectal cancer.[101]
 The 2014 World Health Organization cancer report noted that it has been hypothesized that dietary fiber might help prevent colorectal cancer, but that most studies at the time had not yet studied the correlation.[99] A 2019 review, however, found evidence of benefit from dietary fiber and whole grains.[102] The World Cancer Research Fund listed the benefit of fiber for prevention of colorectal cancer as ""probable"" as of 2017.[103] A 2022 umbrella review says there is ""convincing evidence"" for that association.[104]
 Higher physical activity is recommended.[21][105] Physical exercise is associated with a modest reduction in colon but not rectal cancer risk.[106][107] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of colon cancer by about 21%.[108] Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from colon cancer. Regular exercise does not negate the risk but does lower it.[109]
 Aspirin and celecoxib appear to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer in those at high risk.[110][111] Aspirin is recommended in those who are 50 to 60 years old, do not have an increased risk of bleeding, and are at risk for cardiovascular disease to prevent colorectal cancer.[112] It is not recommended in those at average risk.[113]
 There is tentative evidence for calcium supplementation, but it is not sufficient to make a recommendation.[114] Vitamin D intake and blood levels are associated with a lower risk of colon cancer.[115][116]
 As more than 80% of colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps, screening for this cancer is effective for both early detection and for prevention.[20][117] Diagnosis of cases of colorectal cancer through screening tends to occur 2–3 years before diagnosis of cases with symptoms.[20] Any polyps that are detected can be removed, usually by colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, and thus prevent them from turning into cancer. Screening has the potential to reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 60%.[118]
 The three main screening tests are colonoscopy, fecal occult blood testing, and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Of the three, only sigmoidoscopy cannot screen the right side of the colon where 42% of cancers are found.[119] Flexible sigmoidoscopy, however, has the best evidence for decreasing the risk of death from any cause.[120]
 Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) of the stool is typically recommended every two years and can be either guaiac-based or immunochemical.[20] If abnormal FOBT results are found, participants are typically referred for a follow-up colonoscopy examination. When done once every 1–2 years, FOBT screening reduces colorectal cancer deaths by 16% and among those participating in screening, colorectal cancer deaths can be reduced up to 23%, although it has not been proven to reduce all-cause mortality.[121] Immunochemical tests are accurate and do not require dietary or medication changes before testing.[122] However, research in the UK has found that for these immunochemical tests, the threshold for further investigation is set at a point that may miss more than half of bowel cancer cases. The research suggests that the NHS England's Bowel Cancer Screening Programme could make better use of the test's ability to provide the exact concentration of blood in faeces (rather than only whether it is above or below a cutoff level).[123][124]
 Other options include virtual colonoscopy and stool DNA screening testing (FIT-DNA). Virtual colonoscopy via a CT scan appears as good as standard colonoscopy for detecting cancers and large adenomas but is expensive, associated with radiation exposure, and cannot remove any detected abnormal growths as standard colonoscopy can.[20] Stool DNA screening test looks for biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and precancerous lesions, including altered DNA and blood hemoglobin. A positive result should be followed by colonoscopy. FIT-DNA has more false positives than FIT and thus results in more adverse effects.[10] Further study is required as of 2016 to determine whether a three-year screening interval is correct.[10]
 In the United States, screening is typically recommended between ages 50 and 75 years.[10][125] The American Cancer Society recommends starting at the age of 45.[126] For those between 76 and 85 years old, the decision to screen should be individualized.[10] For those at high risk, screenings usually begin at around 40.[20][127]
 Several screening methods are recommended including stool-based tests every 2 years, sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with fecal immunochemical testing every two years, and colonoscopy every 10 years.[125] It is unclear which of these two methods is better.[128] Colonoscopy may find more cancers in the first part of the colon, but is associated with greater cost and more complications.[128] For people with average risk who have had a high-quality colonoscopy with normal results, the American Gastroenterological Association does not recommend any type of screening in the 10 years following the colonoscopy.[129][130] For people over 75 or those with a life expectancy of less than 10 years, screening is not recommended.[131] It takes about 10 years after screening for one out of a 1000 people to benefit.[132] The USPSTF list seven potential strategies for screening, with the most important thing being that at least one of these strategies is appropriately used.[10]
 In Canada, among those 50 to 75 years old at normal risk, fecal immunochemical testing or FOBT is recommended every two years or sigmoidoscopy every 10 years.[133] Colonoscopy is less preferred.[133]
 Some countries have national colorectal screening programs which offer FOBT screening for all adults within a certain age group, typically starting between ages 50 and 60. Examples of countries with organised screening include the United Kingdom,[134] Australia,[135] the Netherlands,[136] Hong Kong, and Taiwan.[137]
 The UK Bowel Cancer Screening Programme aims to find warning signs in people aged 60 to 74, by recommending a faecal immunochemical test (FIT) every two years. FIT measures blood in faeces, and people with levels above a certain threshold may have bowel tissue examined for signs of cancer. Growths having cancerous potential are removed.[138][124]
 The treatment of colorectal cancer can be aimed at cure or palliation. The decision on which aim to adopt depends on various factors, including the person's health and preferences, as well as the stage of the tumor.[139] Assessment in multidisciplinary teams is a critical part of determining whether the patient is suitable for surgery or not.[140] When colorectal cancer is caught early, surgery can be curative. However, when it is detected at later stages (for which metastases are present), this is less likely and treatment is often directed at palliation, to relieve symptoms caused by the tumour and keep the person as comfortable as possible.[20]
 At an early stage, colorectal cancer may be removed during a colonoscopy using one of several techniques, including endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection.[5] Endoscopic resection is possible if there is low possibility of lymph node metastasis and the size and location of the tumor make en bloc resection possible.[141] For people with localized cancer, the preferred treatment is complete surgical removal with adequate margins, with the attempt of achieving a cure. The procedure of choice is a partial colectomy (or proctocolectomy for rectal lesions) where the affected part of the colon or rectum is removed along with parts of its mesocolon and blood supply to facilitate removal of draining lymph nodes. This can be done either by an open laparotomy or laparoscopically, depending on factors related to the individual person and lesion factors.[20] The colon may then be reconnected or a person may have a colostomy.[5]
 If there are only a few metastases in the liver or lungs, these may also be removed. Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the cancer before attempting to remove it. The two most common sites of recurrence of colorectal cancer are the liver and lungs.[20] For peritoneal carcinomatosis cytoreductive surgery, sometimes in combination with HIPEC can be used in an attempt to remove the cancer.[142]
 In both cancer of the colon and rectum, chemotherapy may be used in addition to surgery in certain cases. The decision to add chemotherapy in management of colon and rectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease.[143]
 In Stage I colon cancer, no chemotherapy is offered, and surgery is the definitive treatment. The role of chemotherapy in Stage II colon cancer is debatable, and is usually not offered unless risk factors such as T4 tumor, undifferentiated tumor, vascular and perineural invasion or inadequate lymph node sampling is identified.[144] It is also known that the people who carry abnormalities of the mismatch repair genes do not benefit from chemotherapy. For Stage III and Stage IV colon cancer, chemotherapy is an integral part of treatment.[20]
 If cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs, which is the case with Stage III and Stage IV colon cancer respectively, adding chemotherapy agents fluorouracil, capecitabine or oxaliplatin increases life expectancy. If the lymph nodes do not contain cancer, the benefits of chemotherapy are controversial. If the cancer is widely metastatic or unresectable, treatment is then palliative. Typically in this setting, a number of different chemotherapy medications may be used.[20] Chemotherapy drugs for this condition may include capecitabine, fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and UFT.[145] The drugs capecitabine and fluorouracil are interchangeable, with capecitabine being an oral medication and fluorouracil being an intravenous medicine. Some specific regimens used for CRC are CAPOX, FOLFOX, FOLFOXIRI, and FOLFIRI.[146] Antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab are often added in first line therapy.[147] Another class of drugs used in the second line setting are epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, of which the three FDA approved ones are aflibercept, cetuximab and panitumumab.[148][149]
 The primary difference in the approach to low stage rectal cancer is the incorporation of radiation therapy. Often, it is used in conjunction with chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant fashion to enable surgical resection, so that ultimately a colostomy is not required. However, it may not be possible in low lying tumors, in which case, a permanent colostomy may be required. Stage IV rectal cancer is treated similar to Stage IV colon cancer.
 Stage IV colorectal cancer due to peritoneal carcinomatosis can be treated using HIPEC combined with cytoreductive surgery, in some people.[150][151][152] Also, T4 colorectal cancer can be treated with HIPEC to avoid future relapses.[153]
 While a combination of radiation and chemotherapy may be useful for rectal cancer,[20] for some people requiring treatment, chemoradiotherapy can increase acute treatment-related toxicity, and has not been shown to improve survival rates compared to radiotherapy alone, although it is associated with less local recurrence.[142]  The use of radiotherapy in colon cancer is not routine due to the sensitivity of the bowels to radiation.[154] As with chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used as a neoadjuvant for clinical stages T3 and T4 for rectal cancer.[155] This results in downsizing or downstaging of the tumour, preparing it for surgical resection, and also decreases local recurrence rates.[155] For locally advanced rectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment.[156] Additionally, when surgery is not possible radiation therapy has been suggested to be an effective treatment against CRC pulmonary metastases, which are developed by 10-15% of people with CRC.[157]
 Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has been found to be useful for a type of colorectal cancer with mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability.[158][159][160] Pembrolizumab is approved for advanced CRC tumours that are MMR deficient and have failed usual treatments.[161] Most people who do improve, however, still worsen after months or years.[159]
 On the other hand, in a prospective phase 2 study published in June 2022 in The New England Journal of Medicine, 12 patients with Deficient Mismatch Repair (dMMR) stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma were administered single-agent dostarlimab, an anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody, every three weeks for six months. After a median follow-up of 12 months (range, 6 to 25 months), all 12 patients had a complete clinical response with no evidence of tumor on MRI, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron-emission tomography, endoscopic evaluation, digital rectal examination, or biopsy. Moreover, no patient in the trial needed chemoradiotherapy or surgery, and no patient reported adverse events of grade 3 or higher. However, although the results of this study are promising, the study is small and has uncertainties about long-term outcomes.[162]
 Palliative care is recommended for any person who has advanced colon cancer or who has significant symptoms.[163][164]
 Involvement of palliative care may be beneficial to improve the quality of life for both the person and his or her family, by improving symptoms, anxiety and preventing admissions to the hospital.[165]
 In people with incurable colorectal cancer, palliative care can consist of procedures that relieve symptoms or complications from the cancer but do not attempt to cure the underlying cancer, thereby improving quality of life. Surgical options may include non-curative surgical removal of some of the cancer tissue, bypassing part of the intestines, or stent placement. These procedures can be considered to improve symptoms and reduce complications such as bleeding from the tumor, abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction.[166] Non-operative methods of symptomatic treatment include radiation therapy to decrease tumor size as well as pain medications.[167]
 In addition to medical intervention, a variety of psychosocial interventions have been implemented to address psychosocial concerns in the context of colorectal cancer.[168] Depression and anxiety are highly prevalent in patients diagnosed with CRC, therefore psychosocial interventions can be helpful for alleviating psychological distress.[169][170] Many patients continue to experience symptoms of anxiety and depression following treatment, regardless of treatment outcome.[169][171] Societal stigmas associated with colorectal cancer present further psychosocial challenges for CRC patients and their families.[172][173]
 Colorectal cancer patients have a 51% higher risk of experiencing depression than individuals without the disease.[170] Additionally, CRC patients are at high risk of experiencing severe anxiety, low self-esteem, poor self-concept, and social anxiety.[169][174]
 Regardless of treatment outcome, many CRC patients experience ongoing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and distress.[169]
 Survivorship of CRC can involve significant lifestyle adjustments.[173] Postoperative afflictions may include stomas, bowel issues, incontinence, odor, and changes to sexual functioning.[173][174] These changes can result in distorted body image, social anxiety, depression, and distress—all of which contribute to a poorer quality of life.[173][175]
 Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide.[176] Transitioning into palliative care and contending with mortality can be a deeply distressing experience for a CRC patient and their loved ones.
 Colorectal cancer is highly stigmatized and can elicit feelings of disgust from  patients, healthcare professionals, family, intimate partners, and the general public.[172] Patients with stomas are especially vulnerable to stigmatization due to unavoidable odors, gas, and unpleasant noises from stoma bags.[172] Additionally, associated CRC risk factors like poor diet, alcohol consumption, and lack of physical activity prompt negative assumptions of blame and personal responsibility onto CRC patients.[173] Judgement from others along with internalized self-blame and embarrassment can negatively affect self-esteem, sociability, and quality of life.[173]
 Face-to-face interventions such as clinician-patient talk therapy, body-mind-spirit practices, and support group sessions have been identified as most effective in reducing anxiety and depression in CRC patients.[168] Additionally, journaling exercises and over-the-phone talk therapy sessions have been implemented.[168] Though deemed less effective, these non-face-to-face interventions are economically inclusive and have been found to reduce both depression and anxiety in CRC patients.[168]
 The U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology provide guidelines for the follow-up of colon cancer.[177][178] A medical history and physical examination are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 5 years. Carcinoembryonic antigen blood level measurements follow the same timing, but are only advised for people with T2 or greater lesions who are candidates for intervention. A CT-scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can be considered annually for the first 3 years for people who are at high risk of recurrence (for example, those who had poorly differentiated tumors or venous or lymphatic invasion) and are candidates for curative surgery (with the aim to cure). A colonoscopy can be done after 1 year, except if it could not be done during the initial staging because of an obstructing mass, in which case it should be performed after 3 to 6 months. If a villous polyp, a polyp >1 centimeter or high-grade dysplasia is found, it can be repeated after 3 years, then every 5 years. For other abnormalities, the colonoscopy can be repeated after 1 year.[143]
 Routine PET or ultrasound scanning, chest X-rays, complete blood count or liver function tests are not recommended.[177][178]
 For people who have undergone curative surgery or adjuvant therapy (or both) to treat non-metastatic colorectal cancer, intense surveillance and close follow-up have not been shown to provide additional survival benefits.[179]
 Exercise may be recommended in the future as secondary therapy to cancer survivors. In epidemiological studies, exercise may decrease colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. Results for the specific amounts of exercise needed to observe a benefit were conflicting. These differences may reflect differences in tumour biology and the expression of biomarkers. People with tumors that lacked CTNNB1 expression (β-catenin), involved in Wnt signalling pathway, required more than 18 Metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week, a measure of exercise, to observe a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. The mechanism of how exercise benefits survival may be involved in immune surveillance and inflammation pathways. In clinical studies, a pro-inflammatory response was found in people with stage II-III colorectal cancer who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after completing their primary therapy. Oxidative balance may be another possible mechanism for benefits observed. A significant decrease in 8-oxo-dG was found in the urine of people who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after primary therapy. Other possible mechanisms may involve metabolic hormone and sex-steroid hormones, although these pathways may be involved in other types of cancers.[180][181]
 Another potential biomarker may be p27. Survivors with tumors that expressed p27 and performed greater and equal to 18 MET hours per week were found to have reduced colorectal cancer mortality survival compared to those with less than 18 MET hours per week. Survivors without p27 expression who exercised were shown to have worse outcomes. The constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may explain the loss of p27 and excess energy balance may up-regulate p27 to stop cancer cells from dividing.[181]
 Physical activity provides benefits to people with non-advanced colorectal cancer. Improvements in aerobic fitness, cancer-related fatigue and health-related quality of life have been reported in the short term.[182] However, these improvements were not observed at the level of disease-related mental health, such as anxiety and depression.[182]
 Fewer than 600 genes are linked to outcomes in colorectal cancer.[51] These include both unfavorable genes, where high expression is related to poor outcome, for example the heat shock 70 kDa protein 1 (HSPA1A), and favorable genes where high expression is associated with better survival, for example the putative RNA-binding protein 3 (RBM3).[51] The prognosis is also correlated with a poor fidelity of the pre-mRNA splicing apparatus, and thus a high number of deviating alternative splicing.[183]
 The average five-year recurrence rate in people with colon cancer where surgery is successful is 5% for stage I cancers, 12% in stage II and 33% in stage III. However, depending on the number of risk factors it ranges from 9–22% in stage II and 17–44% in stage III.[184] The average five-year recurrence rate in people with rectal cancer where surgery is successful is 9% for stage 0 (after pre-treatment) cancers, 8% for stage I cancers, 18% in stage II and 34% in stage III. Depending on the number of risk factors (0-2) the risk for distant metastasis in rectal cancer ranges from 4-11% in stage 0, 6-12% in stage I, 11-28% in stage II and 15-43% in stage III.[185]
 The recurrence rates have decreased over the past decades as a result of improvements in the colorectal cancer management.[186] The risk of recurrence after five years of surveillance remain very low.[187]
 In Europe the five-year survival rate for colorectal cancer is less than 60%. In the developed world about a third of people who get the disease die from it.[20]
 Survival is directly related to detection and the type of cancer involved, but overall is poor for symptomatic cancers, as they are typically quite advanced. Survival rates for early stage detection are about five times that of late stage cancers. People with a tumor that has not breached the muscularis mucosa (TNM stage Tis, N0, M0) have a five-year survival rate of 100%, while those with invasive cancer of T1 (within the submucosal layer) or T2 (within the muscular layer) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 90%. Those with a more invasive tumor yet without node involvement (T3-4, N0, M0) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 70%. People with positive regional lymph nodes (any T, N1-3, M0) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 40%, while those with distant metastases (any T, any N, M1) have a poor prognosis and the five year survival ranges from <5 percent to 31 percent.[188][189][190][191][192]
 Five-year overall survival (OS) in rectal cancer after modern preoperative treatment and surgery was 90% for stage 0, 86% for stage I, 78% for stage II, and 67% for stage III according to a nationwide, population-based study.[185]
 Whilst the impact of colorectal cancer on those who survive varies greatly there will often be a need to adapt to both physical and psychological outcomes of the illness and its treatment.[193] For example, it is common for people to experience incontinence,[194] sexual dysfunction,[195] problems with stoma care[196] and fear of cancer recurrence[197] after primary treatment has concluded.
 A qualitative systematic review published in 2021 highlighted that there are three main factors influencing adaptation to living with and beyond colorectal cancer: support mechanisms, severity of late effects of treatment and psychosocial adjustment. Therefore, it is essential that people are offered appropriate support to help them better adapt to life following treatment.[198]
 Globally more than 1 million people get colorectal cancer every year[20] resulting in about 715,000 deaths as of 2010 up from 490,000 in 1990.[199]
 As of 2012[update], it is the second most common cause of cancer in women (9.2% of diagnoses) and the third most common in men (10.0%)[14]: 16  with it being the fourth most common cause of cancer death after lung, stomach, and liver cancer.[200] It is more common in developed than developing countries.[201] Global incidence varies 10-fold, with highest rates in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the US and lowest rates in Africa and South-Central Asia.[202]
 In 2022, the incidence of colorectal cancer in the United States was anticipated to be about 151,000 adults, including over 106,000 new cases of colon cancer (some 54,000 men and 52,000 women) and about 45,000 new cases of rectal cancer.[203] Since the 1980s, the incidence of colorectal cancer decreased, dropping by about 2% annually from 2014 to 2018 in adults aged 50 and older, due mainly to improved screening.[203] However, incidence of colorectal cancer has increased in individuals aged 25 to 50. In early 2023, the American Cancer Society (ACS) reported that 20% of diagnoses (of colon cancer) in 2019 were in patients under age 55, which is about double the rate in 1995, and rates of advanced disease increased by about 3% annually in people younger than 50. It predicted that, in 2023, an estimated 19,550 diagnoses and 3,750 deaths would be in people younger than 50.[204] Colorectal cancer also disproportionately affects the Black community, where the rates are the highest of any racial/ethnic group in the US. African Americans are about 20% more likely to get colorectal cancer and about 40% more likely to die from it than most other groups. Black Americans often experience greater obstacles to cancer prevention, detection, treatment, and survival, including systemic racial disparities that are complex and go beyond the obvious connection to cancer.
 In the UK about 41,000 people a year get colon cancer making it the fourth most common type.[205]
 One in 19 men and one in 28 women in Australia will develop colorectal cancer before the age of 75; one in 10 men and one in 15 women will develop it by 85 years of age.[206]
 In the developing countries like Papua New Guinea and other Pacific Island States including the Solomon Islands, colorectal cancer is a very rare cancer amongst the people, which is least common compared to lung, stomach, liver or breast cancer. It is estimated that at least 8 in 100,000 of the people are most likely to developed colorectal cancer every year, which is unlike lung or breast cancer, where for the latter alone is 24 in 100,000 women.[207]
 A diagnosis of colorectal cancer in patients under 50 years of age is referred to as early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCC).[176][208] Instances of EOCC have increased over the last decade, specifically in patient populations aged 20 to 40 years old throughout North America, Europe, Australia, and China.[208][209]
 The incidence of colorectal cancer in younger populations has increased over the last decade.[176][208][209]  While advancements in diagnostic procedure may have some impact, reduced likelihood of screening among these populations suggests detection bias is not a major contributor to this trend.  It is more likely that cohort effects are contributing.[209]
 The population experiencing the greatest rise in EOCC cases are men and women aged 20 to 29 years old, with incidence increasing by 7.9% per year between 2004 and 2016.[209] Similarly, though less severe, men and women aged 30 to 39 experienced an increase in cases at a rate of 3.4% per year during that same time period. Despite these increases, the mortality rate for colorectal cancer has remained the same.[209]
 Risk factors associated with EOCC are akin to those of all colorectal cancer cases.[208] Observed cohort-effects are likely the product of generational shifts in lifestyle and environmental factors.[176][208]
 In 2018, the American Cancer Society modified their previous screening guideline for colorectal cancer from age 50 down to age 45 following the recognition of increasing cases of EOCC.[209] Individuals under the age of 60 have been identified as most susceptible to non-participation in colorectal cancer screening.[210]
 Rectal cancer has been diagnosed in an Ancient Egyptian mummy who had lived in the Dakhleh Oasis during the Ptolemaic period.[211]
 In the United States, March is colorectal cancer awareness month.[118]
 Preliminary in-vitro evidence suggests lactic acid bacteria (e.g., lactobacilli, streptococci or lactococci) may be protective against the development and progression of colorectal cancer through several mechanisms such as antioxidant activity, immunomodulation, promoting programmed cell death, antiproliferative effects, and epigenetic modification of cancer cells.[212]

"Colon cancer develops from polyps (growths) in your colon’s inner lining. Healthcare providers have screening tests and treatments that detect and remove precancerous polyps. If untreated, colon cancer may spread to other areas of your body. Thanks to these tests, early treatment and new kinds of treatment, fewer people are dying from colon cancer. Colon (colorectal) cancer starts in your colon (large intestine), the long tube that helps carry digested food to your rectum and out of your body. Colon cancer develops from certain polyps or growths in the inner lining of your colon. Healthcare providers have screening tests that detect precancerous polyps before they can become cancerous tumors. Colon cancer that’s not detected or treated may spread to other areas of your body. Thanks to screening tests, early treatment and new kinds of treatment, fewer people are dying from colon cancer. Your colon wall is made of layers of mucous membrane, tissue and muscle. Colon cancer starts in your mucosa, the innermost lining of your colon. It consists of cells that make and release mucus and other fluids. If these cells mutate or change, they may create a colon polyp. Over time, colon polyps may become cancerous. (It usually takes about 10 years for cancer to form in a colon polyp.) Left undetected and/or untreated, the cancer works its way through a layer of tissue, muscle and the outer layer of your colon. The colon cancer may also spread to other parts of your body via your lymph nodes or your blood vessels. Colon cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in people in the U.S. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB) are slightly more likely to develop colon cancer than women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB). Colon cancer affects more people who are Black than people who are members of other ethnic groups or races. Colon cancer typically affects people age 50 and older. Over the past 15 years, however, the number of people age 20 to 49 with colon cancer has increased by about 1.5% each year. Medical researchers aren’t sure why this is happening. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy You can have colon cancer without having symptoms. If you do have symptoms, you may not be sure if changes in your body are signs of colon cancer. That’s because some colon cancer symptoms are similar to symptoms of less serious conditions. Common symptoms of colon cancer include: Like all types of cancer, colon cancer happens when cells grow and divide uncontrollably. All cells in your body are constantly growing, dividing and dying. That’s how your body remains healthy and working as it should. In colon cancer, cells lining your colon and rectum keep growing and dividing even when they’re supposed to die. These cancerous cells may come from polyps in your colon. Medical researchers aren’t sure why some people develop precancerous colon polyps that become colon cancer. They do know certain risk factors increase people’s chances of developing precancerous polyps and colon cancer. Those risk factors include certain medical conditions, including inherited conditions, and lifestyle choices. Having one or more risk factors for colon cancer doesn’t mean you’ll develop the condition. It just means you have increased risk. Understanding risk factors may help you decide if you should talk to a healthcare provider about your risk of developing colon (colorectal) cancer. Advertisement Healthcare providers use several tests to diagnose colon cancer. Those tests include: A cancer screening test checks for cancer when you don’t have any signs or symptoms of cancer. If your screening test shows abnormalities, a healthcare provider may recommend additional tests. A colonoscopy is the most common screening test for colon cancer. Other tests include: Healthcare providers use the TNM cancer staging system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer to stage colon cancer. There are five stages of colon cancer. Three of the four stages have three sub-stages. The colon cancer staging system includes the following: Stage 0: Healthcare providers may refer to this as carcinoma in situ. When they do, they’re talking about abnormal or precancerous cells in your mucosa, the innermost layer of your colon wall. Stage I: Stage I colorectal cancer has grown into the wall of your intestine but hasn’t spread beyond the muscular coat or into close lymph nodes. Stage II: The cancer has spread farther into the wall of your intestine but hasn’t spread to nearby lymph nodes. There are three types of Stage II colon cancer: Stage III: In this stage, colon cancer has spread to your lymph nodes. Like Stage II colon cancer, there are three sub-stages of Stage III colon cancer: Stage IV: Cancer has spread (metastasized) to other areas of your body, such as your liver, lungs or ovaries: Advertisement Surgery is the most common colon cancer treatment. There are different colon cancer surgeries and procedures: Healthcare providers may combine surgery with adjuvant therapy. This is cancer treatment done before or after surgery. They may also use these treatments for colon cancer that has spread or come back. Treatments may include: You may not be able to prevent colon cancer, but you can reduce your risk of developing the condition by managing risk factors: According to U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) data, more than 90% of people treated for early-stage colorectal cancer were alive five years after diagnosis. (NCI data doesn’t break out separate survival rates for colon and rectal cancer.) NCI data shows that overall, 65% of people with colorectal cancer were alive five years after diagnosis. (A survival rate is an estimate based on the experiences of people with specific kinds of cancer.) Colorectal cancer survival rates vary based on the cancer stage at diagnosis. For example, 73% of people with colorectal cancer that’s spread to nearby tissues, organs or lymph nodes were alive five years after diagnosis. That five-year survival rate drops to 17% if the cancer spreads to a distant organ or lymph node. A survival rate is an estimate based on outcomes — how long people lived after treatment for a specific type of cancer. In this case, survival rates are based on the experiences of large groups of people who have colorectal cancer, and not just colon cancer. In addition, many things affect colon cancer survival rates. If you have this condition, your healthcare provider is your best resource for information about what you can expect. Self-care is an important part of living with colon cancer, but everyone’s situation is different. People treated for early-stage colon cancer may become cancer-free. They’re cancer survivors, but they may worry that their colon cancer will come back. People who have advanced colon cancer have different concerns. They’re also cancer survivors. But for them, living with colon cancer may mean treatment that eases symptoms but doesn’t cure colon cancer. They may benefit from having palliative care. Palliative care helps people manage cancer symptoms and treatment side effects. Follow-up colon cancer care varies depending on the cancer stage. For example, people who have surgery for Stage 0 or Stage I colon cancer may have a colonoscopy one year after surgery, another colonoscopy three years after surgery and a third five years after surgery. Unless the follow-up colonoscopies find signs of cancer, someone with Stage 0 or Stage 1 colon cancer may be able to wait several more years before having another colonoscopy. People successfully treated for Stage II or Stage III colon cancer will need to see their healthcare provider every three to six months for the first two years after treatment and are typically followed for five years from surgery. They may have tests including colonoscopies, CEA blood tests and imaging tests. Anyone recovering from colon cancer treatment should contact their healthcare provider if they notice changes that may indicate the cancer has come back or is spreading. If you’re receiving colon cancer treatment, ask your healthcare provider about symptoms that may be signs you should go to the emergency room. You may need to go to the emergency room if you have: Most people have heard of colon cancer, which is the third most common cancer diagnosed in the U.S. If you have colon cancer, you probably want to know more about your specific situation. Here are some questions you may want to ask your healthcare provider: A note from Cleveland Clinic Thanks to more people taking time for colon cancer screening, healthcare providers are able to catch and treat colon cancer before it causes symptoms, much less spreads. Recent survival rate data show that more than 90% of people treated for early-stage colon cancer were alive five years after diagnosis. People with colon cancer also benefit from having newer treatments that target cancer. If you have colon cancer, ask your healthcare provider about newer treatments that may be appropriate for your situation. Last reviewed on 11/14/2022. Learn more about our editorial process.

"Colon cancer can happen in any part of the colon. An exam of the whole colon using a long, flexible tube with a camera is one way to detect colon cancer and polyps. This exam is called a colonoscopy. Colon cancer can happen in any part of the colon. An exam of the whole colon using a long, flexible tube with a camera is one way to detect colon cancer and polyps. This exam is called a colonoscopy. Colon cancer is a growth of cells that begins in a part of the large intestine called the colon. The colon is the first and longest part of the large intestine. The large intestine is the last part of the digestive system. The digestive system breaks down food for the body to use. Colon cancer typically affects older adults, though it can happen at any age. It usually begins as small clumps of cells called polyps that form inside the colon. Polyps generally aren't cancerous, but some can turn into colon cancers over time. Polyps often don't cause symptoms. For this reason, doctors recommend regular screening tests to look for polyps in the colon. Finding and removing polyps helps prevent colon cancer. If colon cancer develops, many treatments can help control it. Treatments include surgery, radiation therapy and medicines, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Colon cancer is sometimes called colorectal cancer. This term combines colon cancer and rectal cancer, which begins in the rectum. Many people with colon cancer don't have symptoms at first. When symptoms appear, they'll likely depend on the cancer's size and where it is in the large intestine. Symptoms of colon cancer can include: If you notice lasting symptoms that worry you, make an appointment with a health care professional. There is a problem with

Please, try again in a couple of minutes Doctors aren't certain what causes most colon cancers. Colon cancer happens when cells in the colon develop changes in their DNA. A cells' DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. The changes tell the cells to multiply quickly. The changes let the cells continue living when healthy cells die as part of their natural lifecycle. This causes too many cells. The cells might form a mass called a tumor. The cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, the cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. Factors that may increase the risk of colon cancer include: Doctors recommend that people with an average risk of colon cancer consider starting colon cancer screening around age 45. But people with an increased risk should think about starting screening sooner. People with an increased risk include those with a family history of colon cancer. There are several different tests that are used for colon cancer screening. Talk about your options with your health care team. Making changes in everyday life can reduce the risk of colon cancer. To lower the risk of colon cancer: Some medicines can reduce the risk of colon polyps or colon cancer. For instance, some evidence links a reduced risk of polyps and colon cancer to regular use of aspirin or aspirin-like medicines. But it's not clear what dose and what length of time would be needed to reduce the risk of colon cancer. Taking aspirin daily has some risks, including ulcers and bleeding in the digestive system. These options are generally reserved for people with a high risk of colon cancer. There isn't enough evidence to recommend these medicines to people who have an average risk of colon cancer. If you have an increased risk of colon cancer, discuss your risk factors with your health care team to see if preventive medicines are safe for you.

 Coronary artery disease (CAD), also called coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic heart disease (IHD),[13] myocardial ischemia,[14] or simply heart disease, involves the reduction of blood flow to the cardiac muscle due to build-up of atherosclerotic plaque in the arteries of the heart.[5][6][15] It is the most common of the cardiovascular diseases.[16] Types include stable angina, unstable angina, and myocardial infarction.[17]
 A common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw.[4] Occasionally it may feel like heartburn. Usually symptoms occur with exercise or emotional stress, last less than a few minutes, and improve with rest.[4] Shortness of breath may also occur and sometimes no symptoms are present.[4] In many cases, the first sign is a heart attack.[5] Other complications include heart failure or an abnormal heartbeat.[5]
 Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, depression, and excessive alcohol consumption.[6][7][18] A number of tests may help with diagnoses including: electrocardiogram, cardiac stress testing, coronary computed tomographic angiography, biomarkers (high-sensitivity cardiac troponins) and coronary angiogram, among others.[8][19]
Ways to reduce CAD risk include eating a healthy diet, regularly exercising, maintaining a healthy weight, and not smoking.[20][9] Medications for diabetes, high cholesterol, or high blood pressure are sometimes used.[9] There is limited evidence for screening people who are at low risk and do not have symptoms.[21] Treatment involves the same measures as prevention.[10][22] Additional medications such as antiplatelets (including aspirin), beta blockers, or nitroglycerin may be recommended.[10] Procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) may be used in severe disease.[10][23] In those with stable CAD it is unclear if PCI or CABG in addition to the other treatments improves life expectancy or decreases heart attack risk.[24]
 In 2015, CAD affected 110 million people and resulted in 8.9 million deaths.[11][12] It makes up 15.6% of all deaths, making it the most common cause of death globally.[12] The risk of death from CAD for a given age decreased between 1980 and 2010, especially in developed countries.[25] The number of cases of CAD for a given age also decreased between 1990 and 2010.[26] In the United States in 2010, about 20% of those over 65 had CAD, while it was present in 7% of those 45 to 64, and 1.3% of those 18 to 45;[27] rates were higher among males than females of a given age.[27]
 The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort that occurs regularly with activity, after eating, or at other predictable times; this phenomenon is termed stable angina and is associated with narrowing of the arteries of the heart. Angina also includes chest tightness, heaviness, pressure, numbness, fullness, or squeezing.[28] Angina that changes in intensity, character or frequency is termed unstable. Unstable angina may precede myocardial infarction. In adults who go to the emergency department with an unclear cause of pain, about 30% have pain due to coronary artery disease.[29] Angina, shortness of breath, sweating, nausea or vomiting, and lightheadedness are signs of a heart attack, or myocardial infarction, and immediate emergency medical services are crucial.[28]
 With advanced disease, the narrowing of coronary arteries reduces the supply of oxygen-rich blood flowing to the heart, which becomes more pronounced during strenuous activities during which the heart beats faster and has an increased oxygen demand.[30] For some, this causes severe symptoms, while others experience no symptoms at all.[4]
 Symptoms in females can differ from those in males, and the most common symptom reported by females of all races is shortness of breath.[31] Other symptoms more commonly reported by females than males are extreme fatigue, sleep disturbances, indigestion, and anxiety.[32] However, some females do experience irregular heartbeat, dizziness, sweating, and nausea.[28] Burning, pain, or pressure in the chest or upper abdomen that can travel to the arm or jaw can also be experienced in  females, but it is less commonly reported by females than males.[32] On average, females experience symptoms 10 years later than males.[33] Females are less likely to recognize symptoms and seek treatment.[28]
 Coronary artery disease is characterized by heart problems that result from atherosclerosis.[34] Atherosclerosis is a type of arteriosclerosis which is the ""chronic inflammation of the arteries which causes them to harden and accumulate cholesterol plaques (atheromatous plaques) on the artery walls"".[35] CAD has a number of well determined risk factors that contribute to atherosclerosis. These risk factors for CAD include ""smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), abnormal (high) amounts of cholesterol and other fat in the blood (dyslipidemia), type 2 diabetes and being overweight or obese (having excess body fat)"" due to lack of exercise and a poor diet.[36] Some other risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, depression, family history, psychological stress and excessive alcohol.[6][7][18] About half of cases are linked to genetics.[37] Smoking and obesity are associated with about 36% and 20% of cases, respectively.[38] Smoking just one cigarette per day about doubles the risk of CAD.[39] Lack of exercise has been linked to 7–12% of cases.[38][40] Exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange may increase risk.[41] Rheumatologic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis are independent risk factors as well.[42][43][44][45][excessive citations]
 Job stress appears to play a minor role accounting for about 3% of cases.[38] In one study, females who were free of stress from work life saw an increase in the diameter of their blood vessels, leading to decreased progression of atherosclerosis.[46] In contrast, females who had high levels of work-related stress experienced a decrease in the diameter of their blood vessels and significantly increased disease progression.[46] Having a type A behavior pattern, a group of personality characteristics including time urgency, competitiveness, hostility, and impatience,[47] is linked to an increased risk of coronary disease.[48]
 The consumption of different types of fats including trans unsaturated, saturated and trans in a diet ""influences the level of cholesterol that is present in the bloodstream"".[49] Unsaturated fats originate from plant sources (such as oils). There are two types of unsaturated fats, cis and trans isomers. Cis unsaturated fats are bent in molecular structure and trans are linear in structure. Saturated fats originate from animal sources (such as animal fats) and are also molecularly linear in structure.[50] The linear configurations of unsaturated trans and saturated fats allow them to easily accumulate and stack at the arterial walls when consumed in high amounts (and other positive measures towards physical health are not met).
 High levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream lead to atherosclerosis. With increased levels of LDL in the bloodstream, ""LDL particles will form deposits and accumulate within the arterial walls, which will lead to the development of plaques, restricting blood flow"".[49] The resultant reduction in the heart's blood supply due to atherosclerosis in coronary arteries ""causes shortness of breath, angina pectoris (chest pains that are usually relieved by rest), and potentially fatal heart attacks (myocardial infarctions)"".[36]
 The heritability of coronary artery disease has been estimated between 40% and 60%.[51] Genome-wide association studies have identified over 160 genetic susceptibility loci for coronary artery disease.[52]
 Transcripts associated with CAD (TRACs) - FoxP1, ICOSLG, IKZF4/Eos, SMYD3, TRIM28, and TCF3/E2A that are likely markers of regulatory T cells (Treg), consistent with known reductions in Tregs in CAD.[53]
 The RNA changes are mostly related to ciliary and endocytic transcripts, which in the circulating immune system would be related to the immune synapse. The immune synapse is the contact-dependent mode of communication between T cells and B cells, on one side, and a variety of antigen-presenting and immunomodulating cells on the other side.[54] One of the most differentially expressed genes, fibromodulin (FMOD, increased 2.8-fold in CAD). Several other regulated transcripts encode for proteins related to the structure and function of the immune synapse. Nebulette, the most down-regulated transcript (2.4-fold), is an important 'cytolinker' that connects actin and desmin to facilitate cytoskeletal function and vesicular movement. The endocytic pathway is further modulated by changes in tubulin, which is a key microtubule protein, and fidgetin, which is a tubulin-severing enzyme that is a GWAS marker for cardiovascular risk. Protein recycling would be modulated by changes in the proteasomal regulator SIAH3, and the ubiquitin ligase MARCHF10. On the ciliary aspect of the immune synapse, several of the modulated transcripts are related to ciliary length and function. Steriocilin (STRC) has been studied principally in outer sensory hair cells, and mutations lead to deafness. Steriocilin is a partner to mesothelin (MSN), a related super-helical protein, whose transcript is also modulated in CAD. Likewise, DCDC2, a double-cortin protein, is a known modulator of ciliary length. In the signaling pathways of the immune synapse, there were numerous transcripts that related directly to T cell function and the control of differentiation. Butyrophilin (BTN1A1) is a known co-regulator for T cell activation. Fibromodulin is a well-known modulator of the TGF-beta signaling pathway, which is a primary determinant of Tre differentiation. Further impact on the TGF-beta pathway is reflected in concurrent changes in the BMP receptor 1B RNA (BMPR1B), because the bone morphogenic proteins are members of the TGF-beta superfamily, and likewise impact Treg differentiation. As noted, several of the transcripts (TMEM98, NRCAM, SFRP5, SHISA2) are known elements of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is major determinant of Treg differentiation.
 Limitation of blood flow to the heart causes ischemia (cell starvation secondary to a lack of oxygen) of the heart's muscle cells. The heart's muscle cells may die from lack of oxygen and this is called a myocardial infarction (commonly referred to as a heart attack). It leads to damage, death, and eventual scarring of the heart muscle without regrowth of heart muscle cells. Chronic high-grade narrowing of the coronary arteries can induce transient ischemia which leads to the induction of a ventricular arrhythmia, which may terminate into a dangerous heart rhythm known as ventricular fibrillation, which often leads to death.[62]
 Typically, coronary artery disease occurs when part of the smooth, elastic lining inside a coronary artery (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) develops atherosclerosis. With atherosclerosis, the artery's lining becomes hardened, stiffened, and accumulates deposits of calcium, fatty lipids, and abnormal inflammatory cells – to form a plaque. Calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) deposits in the muscular layer of the blood vessels appear to play a significant role in stiffening the arteries and inducing the early phase of coronary arteriosclerosis. This can be seen in a so-called metastatic mechanism of calciphylaxis as it occurs in chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis.[citation needed] Although these people have kidney dysfunction, almost fifty percent of them die due to coronary artery disease. Plaques can be thought of as large ""pimples"" that protrude into the channel of an artery, causing partial obstruction to blood flow. People with coronary artery disease might have just one or two plaques, or might have dozens distributed throughout their coronary arteries. A more severe form is chronic total occlusion (CTO) when a coronary artery is completely obstructed for more than 3 months.[63]
 Microvascular angina is a type of angina pectoris in which chest pain and chest discomfort occur without signs of blockages in the larger coronary arteries of their hearts when an angiogram (coronary angiogram) is being performed.[64][65]
The exact cause of microvascular angina is unknown. Explanations include microvascular dysfunction or epicardial atherosclerosis.[66][67] For reasons that are not well understood, females are more likely than males to have it; however, hormones and other risk factors unique to females may play a role.[68]
 The diagnosis of CAD depends largely on the nature of the symptoms. The first investigation when CAD is suspected is an electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG), both for stable angina and acute coronary syndrome. An X-ray of the chest, blood tests and resting echocardiography may be performed.[69][70]
 For stable patient but who are symptomatic there are several non-invasive tests to diagnose CAD depending on pre assessment of the risk profile. Non invasive imaging include; Computed tomography angiography (CTA) (anatomical imaging, best test in patients with low risk profile-to ""rule out"" the disease), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/nuclear stress test/myocardial scintigraphy and stress echocardiography (the three latter can be summarized as functional non invasive methods and are typically better to ""rule in""). Exercise ECG or stress test is inferior to non-invasive imaging methods due to risk of both false negative and false positive test results. The use of non-invasive imaging is not recommended on individuals who are exhibiting no symptoms and are otherwise at low risk for developing coronary disease.[71][72] Invasive testing with coronary angiography (ICA) can be used when non-invasive testing is inconclusive or show a high event risk.[70]
 The diagnosis of microvascular angina (previously known as cardiac syndrome X – the rare coronary artery disease that is more common in  females, as mentioned, is a diagnosis of exclusion. Therefore, usually, the same tests are used as in any person with the suspected of having coronary artery disease:[73]
 Stable angina is the most common form of ischemic heart disease, and is associated with reduced quality of life and increased mortality. It is caused by epicardial coronary stenosis which results in reduced blood flow and oxygen supply to the myocardium.[74] 
Stable angina is characterized as short-term chest pain during physical exertion caused by an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and metabolic oxygen demand. Various forms of cardiac stress tests may be used to induce both symptoms and detect changes by way of electrocardiography (using an ECG), echocardiography (using ultrasound of the heart) or scintigraphy (using uptake of radionuclide by the heart muscle). If part of the heart seems to receive an insufficient blood supply, coronary angiography may be used to identify stenosis of the coronary arteries and suitability for angioplasty or bypass surgery.[75]
 In minor to moderate cases, nitroglycerine may be used to alleviate acute symptoms of stable angina or may be used immediately prior to exertion to prevent the onset of angina. Sublingual nitroglycerine is most commonly used to provide rapid relief for acute angina attacks and as a complement to anti-anginal treatments in patients with refractory and recurrent angina.[76] When nitroglycerine enters the bloodstream, it forms free radical nitric oxide, or NO, which activates guanylate cyclase and in turn stimulates the release of cyclic GMP. This molecular signaling stimulates smooth muscle relaxation, ultimately resulting in vasodilation and consequently improved blood flow to regions of the heart affected by atherosclerotic plaque.[77]
 Stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) is also often called stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD).[78] A 2015 monograph explains that ""Regardless of the nomenclature, stable angina is the chief manifestation of SIHD or SCAD.""[78] There are U.S. and European clinical practice guidelines for SIHD/SCAD.[79][80][70] In patients with non-severe asymptomatic aortic valve stenosis and no overt coronary artery disease, the increased troponin T (above 14 pg/mL) was found associated with an increased 5-year event rate of ischemic cardiac events (myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass surgery).[81]
 Diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome generally takes place in the emergency department, where ECGs may be performed sequentially to identify ""evolving changes"" (indicating ongoing damage to the heart muscle). Diagnosis is clear-cut if ECGs show elevation of the ""ST segment"", which in the context of severe typical chest pain is strongly indicative of an acute myocardial infarction (MI); this is termed a STEMI (ST-elevation MI) and is treated as an emergency with either urgent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (angioplasty with or without stent insertion) or with thrombolysis (""clot buster"" medication), whichever is available. In the absence of ST-segment elevation, heart damage is detected by cardiac markers (blood tests that identify heart muscle damage). If there is evidence of damage (infarction), the chest pain is attributed to a ""non-ST elevation MI"" (NSTEMI). If there is no evidence of damage, the term ""unstable angina"" is used. This process usually necessitates hospital admission and close observation on a coronary care unit for possible complications (such as cardiac arrhythmias – irregularities in the heart rate). Depending on the risk assessment, stress testing or angiography may be used to identify and treat coronary artery disease in patients who have had an NSTEMI or unstable angina.[citation needed]
 There are various risk assessment systems for determining the risk of coronary artery disease, with various emphasis on different variables above. A notable example is Framingham Score, used in the Framingham Heart Study. It is mainly based on age, gender, diabetes, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tobacco smoking, and systolic blood pressure. When it comes to predicting risk in younger adults (18–39 years old), Framingham Risk Score remains below 10–12% for all deciles of baseline-predicted risk.[82]
 Polygenic score is another way of risk assessment. In one study the relative risk of incident coronary events was 91% higher among participants at high genetic risk than among those at low genetic risk.[83]
 Up to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided.[84][85] Prevention involves adequate physical exercise, decreasing obesity, treating high blood pressure, eating a healthy diet, decreasing cholesterol levels, and stopping smoking. Medications and exercise are roughly equally effective.[86] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of coronary artery disease by about 25%.[87] Life's Essential 8 are the key measures for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health, as defined by the American Heart Association. AHA added sleep as a factor influencing heart health in 2022.[88]
 Most guidelines recommend combining these preventive strategies. A 2015 Cochrane Review found some evidence that counseling and education to bring about behavioral change might help in high-risk groups. However, there was insufficient evidence to show an effect on mortality or actual cardiovascular events.[89]
 In diabetes mellitus, there is little evidence that very tight blood sugar control improves cardiac risk although improved sugar control appears to decrease other problems such as kidney failure and blindness.[90]
 A diet high in fruits and vegetables decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death.[91] Vegetarians have a lower risk of heart disease,[92][93] possibly due to their greater consumption of fruits and vegetables.[94] Evidence also suggests that the Mediterranean diet[95] and a high fiber diet lower the risk.[96][97]
 The consumption of trans fat (commonly found in hydrogenated products such as margarine) has been shown to cause a precursor to atherosclerosis[98] and increase the risk of coronary artery disease.[99]
 Evidence does not support a beneficial role for omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in preventing cardiovascular disease (including myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death).[100][101] There is tentative evidence that intake of menaquinone (Vitamin K2), but not phylloquinone (Vitamin K1), may reduce the risk of CAD mortality.[102]
 Secondary prevention is preventing further sequelae of already established disease. Effective lifestyle changes include:
 Aerobic exercise, like walking, jogging, or swimming, can reduce the risk of mortality from coronary artery disease.[105] Aerobic exercise can help decrease blood pressure and the amount of blood cholesterol (LDL) over time. It also increases HDL cholesterol.[106]
 Although exercise is beneficial, it is unclear whether doctors should spend time counseling patients to exercise. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found ""insufficient evidence"" to recommend that doctors counsel patients on exercise but ""it did not review the evidence for the effectiveness of physical activity to reduce chronic disease, morbidity, and mortality"", only the effectiveness of counseling itself.[107] The American Heart Association, based on a non-systematic review, recommends that doctors counsel patients on exercise.[108]
 Psychological symptoms are common in people with CHD, and while many psychological treatments may be offered following cardiac events, there is no evidence that they change mortality, the risk of revascularization procedures, or the rate of non-fatal myocardial infarction.[104]
 Antibiotics for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease
 Antibiotics may help patients with coronary disease to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.[109] However, the latest evidence suggests that antibiotics for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease are harmful with increased mortality and occurrence of stroke.[109] So, the use of antibiotics is not currently supported for preventing secondary coronary heart disease.
 A thorough systematic review found that indeed there is a link between a CHD condition and brain dysfunction in  females.[110] Consequently, since research is showing that cardiovascular diseases, like CHD, can play a role as a precursor for dementia, like Alzheimer's disease, individuals with CHD should have a neuropsychological assessment.[111]
 There are a number of treatment options for coronary artery disease:[112]
 It is recommended that blood pressure typically be reduced to less than 140/90 mmHg.[117] The diastolic blood pressure however should not be lower than 60 mmHg. Beta blockers are recommended first line for this use.[117]
 In those with no previous history of heart disease, aspirin decreases the risk of a myocardial infarction but does not change the overall risk of death.[118] Aspirin therapy to prevent heart disease is thus recommended only in adults who are at increased risk for cardiovascular events, which may include postmenopausal  females, males above 40, and younger people with risk factors for coronary heart disease, including high blood pressure, a family history of heart disease, or diabetes. The benefits outweigh the harms most favorably in people at high risk for a cardiovascular event, where high risk is defined as at least a 3% chance over a five-year period, but others with lower risk may still find the potential benefits worth the associated risks.[119]
 Clopidogrel plus aspirin (dual anti-platelet therapy) reduces cardiovascular events more than aspirin alone in those with a STEMI. In others at high risk but not having an acute event, the evidence is weak.[120] Specifically, its use does not change the risk of death in this group.[121] In those who have had a stent, more than 12 months of clopidogrel plus aspirin does not affect the risk of death.[122]
 Revascularization for acute coronary syndrome has a mortality benefit.[123] Percutaneous revascularization for stable ischaemic heart disease does not appear to have benefits over medical therapy alone.[124] In those with disease in more than one artery, coronary artery bypass grafts appear better than percutaneous coronary interventions.[125] Newer ""anaortic"" or no-touch off-pump coronary artery revascularization techniques have shown reduced postoperative stroke rates comparable to percutaneous coronary intervention.[126] Hybrid coronary revascularization has also been shown to be a safe and feasible procedure that may offer some advantages over conventional CABG though it is more expensive.[127]
 As of 2010, CAD was the leading cause of death globally resulting in over 7 million deaths.[129] This increased from 5.2 million deaths from CAD worldwide in 1990.[129] It may affect individuals at any age but becomes dramatically more common at progressively older ages, with approximately a tripling with each decade of life.[130] Males are affected more often than females.[130]
 It is estimated that 60% of the world's cardiovascular disease burden will occur in the South Asian subcontinent despite only accounting for 20% of the world's population. This may be secondary to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Organizations such as the Indian Heart Association are working with the World Heart Federation to raise awareness about this issue.[131]
 Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death for both males and females and accounts for approximately 600,000 deaths in the United States every year.[132] According to present trends in the United States, half of healthy 40-year-old males will develop CAD in the future, and one in three healthy 40-year-old  females.[133] It is the most common reason for death of males and females over 20 years of age in the United States.[134]
 After analysing data from 2 111 882 patients, the recent meta-analysis revealed that the incidence of coronary artery diseases in breast cancer survicors was 4.29 (95% CI 3.09–5.94) per 1000 person-years.[135]
 Other terms sometimes used for this condition are ""hardening of the arteries"" and ""narrowing of the arteries"".[136] In Latin it is known as morbus ischaemicus cordis (MIC).
 The Infarct Combat Project (ICP) is an international nonprofit organization founded in 1998 which tries to decrease ischemic heart diseases through education and research.[137]
 In 2016 research into the archives of the [failed verification]Sugar Association, the trade association for the sugar industry in the US, had sponsored an influential literature review published in 1965 in the New England Journal of Medicine that downplayed early findings about the role of a diet heavy in sugar in the development of CAD and emphasized the role of fat; that review influenced decades of research funding and guidance on healthy eating.[138][139][140][141]
 Research efforts are focused on new angiogenic treatment modalities and various (adult) stem-cell therapies. A region on chromosome 17 was confined to families with multiple cases of myocardial infarction.[142] Other genome-wide studies have identified a firm risk variant on chromosome 9 (9p21.3).[143] However, these and other loci are found in intergenic segments and need further research in understanding how the phenotype is affected.[144]
 A more controversial link is that between Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection and atherosclerosis.[145] While this intracellular organism has been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques, evidence is inconclusive as to whether it can be considered a causative factor.[146] Treatment with antibiotics in patients with proven atherosclerosis has not demonstrated a decreased risk of heart attacks or other coronary vascular diseases.[147]
 Myeloperoxidase has been proposed as a biomarker.[148]
 Plant-based nutrition has been suggested as a way to reverse coronary artery disease,[149] but strong evidence is still lacking for claims of potential benefits.[150]
 Several immunosuppressive drugs targeting the chronic inflammation in coronary artery disease have been tested.[151]

"Coronary artery disease (CAD) limits blood flow in your coronary arteries, which deliver blood to your heart muscle. Cholesterol and other substances make up plaque that narrows your coronary arteries. Chest pain is the most common CAD symptom. CAD can lead to a heart attack, abnormal heart rhythms or heart failure. Many treatments are available. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a narrowing or blockage of your coronary arteries, which supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. This happens because, over time, plaque (including cholesterol) buildup in these arteries limits how much blood can reach your heart muscle. Picture two traffic lanes that merge into one due to construction. Traffic keeps flowing, just more slowly. With CAD, you might not notice anything is wrong until the plaque triggers a blood clot. The blood clot is like a concrete barrier in the middle of the road. Traffic stops. Similarly, blood can’t reach your heart, and this causes a heart attack. You might have CAD for many years and not have any symptoms until you experience a heart attack. That’s why CAD is a “silent killer.” Other names for CAD include coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic heart disease. It’s also what most people mean when they use the general term “heart disease.” There are two main forms of coronary artery disease: Coronary artery disease is very common. Over 18 million adults in the U.S. have coronary artery disease. That’s roughly the combined populations of New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston. In 2021, coronary artery disease killed 375,500 people in the U.S. Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and around the world.

Policy You may have no symptoms of coronary artery disease for a long time. Plaque buildup takes many years, even decades. But as your arteries narrow, you may notice mild symptoms. These symptoms mean your heart is pumping harder to deliver oxygen-rich blood to your body. Symptoms of chronic CAD include: Sometimes, the first coronary artery disease symptom is a heart attack. Atherosclerosis causes coronary artery disease. Atherosclerosis is the gradual buildup of plaque in arteries throughout your body. When the plaque affects blood flow in your coronary arteries, you have coronary artery disease. Plaque consists of cholesterol, waste products, calcium and fibrin (a substance that helps your blood clot). As plaque collects along your artery walls, your arteries become narrow and stiff. Plaque can clog or damage your arteries, which limits or stops blood flow to a certain part of your body. When plaque builds up in your coronary arteries, your heart muscle can’t receive enough blood. So, your heart can’t get the oxygen and nutrients it needs to work properly (myocardial ischemia). It leads to chest discomfort (angina) and puts you at risk of a heart attack. People who have plaque buildup in their coronary arteries often have buildup elsewhere in their body, too. This can lead to conditions like carotid artery disease and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Partly. Family history affects your risk of coronary artery disease, but many other risk factors have nothing to do with your genetics. The choices you make every day add up to a big impact on your risk of CAD. There are many risk factors for coronary artery disease. You can’t change all of them, but you can manage some of them by making lifestyle changes or taking medications. Talk with your provider about what you can do about these risk factors: Advertisement The main complication of coronary artery disease is a heart attack. This is a medical emergency that can be fatal. Your heart muscle starts to die because it’s not receiving enough blood. You need prompt medical attention to restore blood flow to your heart and save your life. Over the years, CAD can also weaken your heart and lead to complications, including:  Healthcare providers diagnose coronary artery disease through a physical exam and testing. During your physical exam, your provider will: All of this information will help your provider determine your risk for heart disease. Your provider may also recommend one or more tests to assess your heart function and diagnose CAD. These include: Advertisement Coronary artery disease treatment often includes lifestyle changes, risk factor management and medications. Some people may also need a procedure or surgery. Your healthcare provider will talk with you about the best treatment plan for you. It’s important to follow your treatment plan so you can lower your risk of serious complications from CAD. Lifestyle changes play a big role in treating coronary artery disease. Such changes include: Be sure to talk with your provider before starting any new exercise program. Your provider can also offer guidance on lifestyle changes tailored to your needs. They may recommend smoking cessation options or meeting with a dietitian to discuss healthy eating plans. Managing your risk factors for CAD can help slow down the progression of your disease. Work with your provider to manage the following conditions: Medications can help you manage your risk factors and treat symptoms of coronary artery disease. Your provider may prescribe one or more medications that: Some people need a procedure or surgery to manage coronary artery disease, including: Complications or side effects of coronary artery disease treatments may include: After PCI (angioplasty), you can usually get back to normal activities within a week. After CABG (bypass surgery), you’ll be in the hospital for more than a week. After that, it’ll take six to 12 weeks for a full recovery. You can’t always prevent coronary artery disease because some risk factors are out of your control. But you can lower your risk of coronary artery disease and help prevent it from getting worse in these ways: Your provider is the best person to ask about your prognosis. Outcomes vary based on the person. Your provider will look at the big picture, including your age, medical conditions, risk factors and symptoms. Lifestyle changes and other treatments can improve your chances of a good prognosis. You can’t reverse coronary artery disease. But you can manage your condition and prevent it from getting worse. Work with your healthcare provider and follow your treatment plan. Doing so will give you the strongest possible chance of living a long and healthy life. The most important thing you can do is keep up with your treatment plan. This may include lifestyle changes and medications. It may also involve a procedure or surgery and the necessary recovery afterward. Along with treatment, your provider may recommend cardiac rehab. A cardiac rehab program is especially helpful for people recovering from a heart attack or living with heart failure. Cardiac rehab can help you with exercise, dietary changes and stress management. A CAD diagnosis may make you think about your heart and arteries more than ever before. This can be exhausting and overwhelming. You may worry a lot about your symptoms or what might happen to you. Many people with coronary artery disease experience depression and anxiety. It’s normal to worry when you’re living with a condition that can be life-threatening. But the worry shouldn’t consume your daily life. You can still live an active, fulfilling life while having heart disease. If your diagnosis is affecting your mental health, talk with a counselor. Find a support group where you can meet people who share your concerns. Don’t feel you need to keep it all inside or be strong for others. CAD is a life-changing diagnosis. It’s OK to devote time to processing it all and figuring out how to feel better, both physically and emotionally. Your provider will tell you how often you need to come in for testing or follow-ups. You may have appointments with specialists (like a cardiologist) in addition to your primary care visits. Call your provider if you: Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have symptoms of a heart attack or stroke. These are life-threatening medical emergencies that require immediate care. It may be helpful to print out the symptoms and keep them where you can see them. Also, share the symptoms with your family and friends so they can call 911 for you if needed. If your provider hasn’t diagnosed you with coronary artery disease, consider asking: If you have coronary artery disease, some helpful questions include: A note from Cleveland Clinic Learning you have coronary artery disease can cause a mix of emotions. You may feel confused about how this could happen. You may feel sad or wish you’d done some things differently to avoid this diagnosis. But this is a time to look forward, not backward.

"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common type of heart disease. It affects the main blood vessels that supply blood to the heart, called the coronary arteries. In CAD, there is reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. A buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls, a condition called atherosclerosis, usually causes coronary artery disease. The buildup, called plaque, makes the arteries narrow. Coronary artery disease often develops over many years. Symptoms are from the lack of blood flow to the heart. They may include chest pain and shortness of breath. A complete blockage of blood flow can cause a heart attack. Treatment for coronary artery disease may include medicines and surgery. Eating a nutritious diet, getting regular exercise and not smoking can help prevent coronary artery disease and the conditions that can cause it. Coronary artery disease also may be called coronary heart disease. Stephen Kopecky, M.D., talks about the risk factors, symptoms and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Learn how lifestyle changes can lower your risk. {Music playing} Stephen Kopecky, M.D., Cardiovascular Disease, Mayo Clinic: I'm Dr. Stephen Kopecky, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic. In this video, we'll cover the basics of coronary artery disease. What is it? Who gets it? The symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Whether you're looking for answers for yourself or someone you love, we're here to give you the best information available. Coronary artery disease, also called CAD, is a condition that affects your heart. It is the most common heart disease in the United States. CAD happens when coronary arteries struggle to supply the heart with enough blood, oxygen and nutrients. Cholesterol deposits, or plaques, are almost always to blame. These buildups narrow your arteries, decreasing blood flow to your heart. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath or even a heart attack. CAD typically takes a long time to develop. So often, patients don't know that they have it until there's a problem. But there are ways to prevent coronary artery disease, and ways to know if you're at risk and ways to treat it. Anyone can develop CAD. It begins when fats, cholesterols and other substances gather along the walls of your arteries. This process is called atherosclerosis. It's typically no cause for concern. However, too much buildup can lead to a blockage, obstructing blood flow. There are a number of risk factors, common red flags, that can contribute to this and ultimately lead to coronary artery disease. First, getting older can mean more damaged and narrowed arteries. Second, men are generally at a greater risk. But the risk for women increases after menopause. Existing health conditions matter, too. High blood pressure can thicken your arteries, narrowing your blood flow. High cholesterol levels can increase the rate of plaque buildup. Diabetes is also associated with higher risk, as is being overweight. Your lifestyle plays a large role as well. Physical inactivity, long periods of unrelieved stress in your life, an unhealthy diet and smoking can all increase your risk. And finally, family history. If a close relative was diagnosed at an early age with heart disease, you're at a greater risk. All these factors together can paint a picture of your risk for developing CAD. When coronary arteries become narrow, the heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Remember, unlike most pumps, the heart has to pump its own energy supply. It's working harder with less. And you may begin to notice these signs and symptoms of pressure or tightness in your chest. This pain is called angina. It may feel like somebody is standing on your chest. When your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you might develop shortness of breath or extreme fatigue during activities. And if an artery becomes totally blocked, it leads to a heart attack. Classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing, substernal chest pain, pain in your shoulders or arms, shortness of breath, and sweating. However, many heart attacks have minimal or no symptoms and are found later during routine testing. Diagnosing CAD starts by talking to your doctor. They'll be able to look at your medical history, do a physical exam and order routine blood work. Depending on that, they may suggest one or more of the following tests: an electrocardiogram or ECG, an echocardiogram or soundwave test of the heart, stress test, cardiac catheterization and angiogram, or a cardiac CT scan. Treating coronary artery disease usually means making changes to your lifestyle. This might be eating healthier foods, exercising regularly, losing excess weight, reducing stress or quitting smoking. The good news is these changes can do a lot to improve your outlook. Living a healthier life translates to having healthier arteries. When necessary, treatment could involve drugs like aspirin, cholesterol-modifying medications, beta-blockers, or certain medical procedures like angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery. Discovering you have coronary artery disease can be overwhelming. But be encouraged. There are things you can do to manage and live with this condition. Reducing cholesterol, lowering blood pressure, quitting tobacco, eating healthier, exercising and managing your stress can make a world of difference. Better heart health starts by educating yourself. So don't be afraid to seek out information and ask your doctors about coronary artery disease. If you'd like to learn even more about this condition, watch our other related videos or visit Mayoclinic.org. We wish you well. Symptoms of coronary artery disease happen when the heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Coronary artery disease symptoms may include: Symptoms of coronary artery disease may not be noticed at first. Sometimes symptoms only happen when the heart is beating hard, such as during exercise. As the coronary arteries continue to narrow, symptoms can get more severe or frequent. A completely blocked coronary artery will cause a heart attack. Common heart attack symptoms include: Chest pain is usually the most common symptom of heart attack. But for some people, such as women, the elderly and those with diabetes, symptoms may seem unrelated to a heart attack. For example, they may have nausea or a very brief pain in the neck or back. Some people having a heart attack don't notice symptoms. If you think you're having a heart attack, immediately call 911 or your local emergency number. If you don't have access to emergency medical services, have someone drive you to the nearest hospital. Drive yourself only as a last option. Smoking or having high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity or a strong family history of heart disease makes you more likely to get coronary artery disease. If you're at high risk of coronary artery disease, talk to your healthcare professional. You may need tests to check for narrowed arteries and coronary artery disease. There is a problem with

 Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a type of venous thrombosis involving the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein, most commonly in the legs or pelvis.[9][a] A minority of DVTs occur in the arms.[11] Symptoms can include pain, swelling, redness, and enlarged veins in the affected area, but some DVTs have no symptoms.[1]
 The most common life-threatening concern with DVT is the potential for a clot to embolize (detach from the veins), travel as an embolus through the right side of the heart, and become lodged in a pulmonary artery that supplies blood to the lungs. This is called a pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT and PE comprise the cardiovascular disease of venous thromboembolism (VTE).[2] About two-thirds of VTE manifests as DVT only, with one-third manifesting as PE with or without DVT.[12] The most frequent long-term DVT complication is post-thrombotic syndrome, which can cause pain, swelling, a sensation of heaviness, itching, and in severe cases, ulcers.[5] Recurrent VTE occurs in about 30% of those in the ten years following an initial VTE.[3]
 The mechanism behind DVT formation typically involves some combination of decreased blood flow, increased tendency to clot, changes to the blood vessel wall, and inflammation.[13] Risk factors include recent surgery, older age, active cancer, obesity, infection, inflammatory diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome, personal history and family history of VTE, trauma, injuries, lack of movement, hormonal birth control, pregnancy, and the period following birth. VTE has a strong genetic component, accounting for approximately 50 to 60% of the variability in VTE rates.[4] Genetic factors include non-O blood type, deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S and the mutations of factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A. In total, dozens of genetic risk factors have been identified.[4][14]
 People suspected of having DVT can be assessed using a prediction rule such as the Wells score. A D-dimer test can also be used to assist with excluding the diagnosis or to signal a need for further testing.[5] Diagnosis is most commonly confirmed by ultrasound of the suspected veins.[5] VTE becomes much more common with age. The condition is rare in children, but occurs in almost 1% of those ≥ age 85 annually.[3] Asian, Asian-American, Native American, and Hispanic individuals have a lower VTE risk than Whites or Blacks.[4][15] Populations in Asia have VTE rates at 15 to 20% of what is seen in Western countries.[16]
 Using blood thinners is the standard treatment. Typical medications include rivaroxaban, apixaban, and warfarin. Beginning warfarin treatment requires an additional non-oral anticoagulant, often injections of heparin.[17][18][19] Prevention of VTE for the general population includes avoiding obesity and maintaining an active lifestyle. Preventive efforts following low-risk surgery include early and frequent walking. Riskier surgeries generally prevent VTE with a blood thinner or aspirin combined with intermittent pneumatic compression.[7]
 Symptoms classically affect a leg and typically develop over hours or days,[20] though they can develop suddenly or over a matter of weeks.[21] The legs are primarily affected, with 4–10% of DVT occurring in the arms.[11] Despite the signs and symptoms being highly variable,[5] the typical symptoms are pain, swelling, and redness. However, these symptoms might not manifest in the lower limbs of those unable to walk.[22] In those who are able to walk, DVT can reduce one's ability to do so.[23] The pain can be described as throbbing and can worsen with weight-bearing, prompting one to bear more weight with the unaffected leg.[21][24] Additional signs and symptoms include tenderness, pitting edema (see image), dilation of surface veins, warmth, discoloration, a ""pulling sensation"", and even cyanosis (a blue or purplish discoloration) with fever.[5][20][21] DVT can also exist without causing any symptoms.[22] Signs and symptoms help in determining the likelihood of DVT, but they are not used alone for diagnosis.[19]
 At times, DVT can cause symptoms in both arms or both legs, as with bilateral DVT.[25] Rarely, a clot in the inferior vena cava can cause both legs to swell.[26] Superficial vein thrombosis, also known as superficial thrombophlebitis, is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) in a vein close to the skin. It can co-occur with DVT and can be felt as a ""palpable cord"".[20] Migratory thrombophlebitis (Trousseau's syndrome) is a noted finding in those with pancreatic cancer and is associated with DVT.[27]
 A pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a blood clot from a deep vein (a DVT) detaches from a vein (embolizes), travels through the right side of the heart, and becomes lodged as an embolus in a pulmonary artery that supplies deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation.[28] Up to one-fourth of PE cases are thought to result in sudden death.[12] When not fatal, PE can cause symptoms such as sudden onset shortness of breath or chest pain, coughing up blood (hemoptysis), and fainting (syncope).[29][30] The chest pain can be pleuritic (worsened by deep breaths)[29] and can vary based upon where the embolus is lodged in the lungs. An estimated 30–50% of those with PE have detectable DVT by compression ultrasound.[30]
 A rare and massive DVT that causes significant obstruction and discoloration (including cyanosis) is phlegmasia cerulea dolens.[31][32] It is life-threatening, limb-threatening, and carries a risk of venous gangrene.[33] Phlegmasia cerulea dolens can occur in the arm but more commonly affects the leg.[34][35] If found in the setting of acute compartment syndrome, an urgent fasciotomy is warranted to protect the limb.[36] Superior vena cava syndrome is a rare complication of arm DVT.[11]
 DVT is thought to be able to cause a stroke in the presence of a heart defect. This is called a paradoxical embolism because the clot abnormally travels from the pulmonary circuit to the systemic circuit while inside the heart. The defect of a patent foramen ovale is thought to allow clots to travel through the interatrial septum from the right atrium into the left atrium.[37][38]
 In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation.[39] Cellulitis is a frequent mimic of DVT, with its triad of pain, swelling, and redness.[20] Symptoms concerning for DVT are more often due to other causes, including cellulitis, ruptured Baker's cyst, hematoma, lymphedema, and chronic venous insufficiency.[1] Other differential diagnoses include tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, connective tissue disorders,[40] superficial vein thrombosis, muscle vein thrombosis, and varicose veins.[41]
 DVT and PE are the two manifestations of the cardiovascular disease venous thromboembolism (VTE).[2] VTE can occur as DVT only, DVT with PE, or PE only.[3] About two-thirds of VTE manifests as DVT only, with one-third manifesting as PE with or without DVT.[12] VTE, along with superficial vein thrombosis, are common types of venous thrombosis.[10]
 DVT is classified as acute when the clots are developing or have recently developed, whereas chronic DVT persists more than 28 days.[42] Differences between these two types of DVT can be seen with ultrasound.[43] An episode of VTE after an initial one is classified as recurrent.[44][45] Bilateral DVT refers to clots in both limbs while unilateral means only a single limb is affected.[46]
 DVT in a leg above the knee is termed proximal DVT (proximal). DVT in a leg below the knee is termed distal DVT (distal), also called calf DVT when affecting the calf,[47][48] and has limited clinical significance compared to proximal DVT.[49] Calf DVT makes up about half of DVTs.[50] Iliofemoral DVT is described as involving either the iliac, or common femoral vein;[51] elsewhere, it has been defined as involving at a minimum the common iliac vein, which is near the top of the pelvis.[19]
 DVT can be classified into provoked and unprovoked categories.[52] For example, DVT that occurs in association with cancer or surgery can be classified as provoked.[52] However, the European Society of Cardiology in 2019 urged for this dichotomy to be abandoned to encourage more personalized risk assessments for recurrent VTE.[53] The distinction between these categories is not always clear.[54]
 Traditionally, the three factors of Virchow's triad—venous stasis, hypercoagulability, and changes in the endothelial blood vessel lining—contribute to VTE and were used to explain its formation.[55] More recently, inflammation has been identified as playing a clear causal role.[13] Other related causes include activation of immune system components, the state of microparticles in the blood, the concentration of oxygen, and possible platelet activation.[56] Various risk factors contribute to VTE, including genetic and environmental factors, though many with multiple risk factors never develop it.[57][58]
 Acquired risk factors include the strong risk factor of older age,[5] which alters blood composition to favor clotting.[59] Previous VTE, particularly unprovoked VTE, is a strong risk factor.[60] A leftover clot from a prior DVT increases the risk of a subsequent DVT.[61] Major surgery and trauma increase risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood.[62] Minor injuries,[63] lower limb amputation,[64] hip fracture, and long bone fractures are also risks.[9] In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis can be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow as part of the procedure.[56] Inactivity and immobilization contribute to venous stasis, as with orthopedic casts,[65] paralysis, sitting, long-haul travel, bed rest, hospitalization,[62] catatonia,[66] and in survivors of acute stroke.[67] Conditions that involve compromised blood flow in the veins are May–Thurner syndrome, where a vein of the pelvis is compressed, and venous thoracic outlet syndrome, which includes Paget–Schroetter syndrome, where compression occurs near the base of the neck.[68][69][70]
 Infections, including sepsis, COVID-19, HIV, and active tuberculosis, increase risk.[71][72][73][74][75] Chronic inflammatory diseases and some autoimmune diseases,[76] such as inflammatory bowel disease,[77] systemic sclerosis,[78] Behçet's syndrome,[79] primary antiphospholipid syndrome,[80] and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)[81] increase risk. SLE itself is frequently associated with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome.[82]
 Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor.[83] Cancers of the blood, lung, pancreas, brain, stomach, and bowel are associated with high VTE risk.[84] Solid tumors such as adenocarcinomas can contribute to both VTE and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In severe cases, this can lead to simultaneous clotting and bleeding.[85] Chemotherapy treatment also increases risk.[86] Obesity increases the potential of blood to clot, as does pregnancy. In the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives[b] and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.[56]
 Dozens of genetic risk factors have been identified,[14] and they account for approximately 50 to 60% of the variability in VTE rates.[4] As such, family history of VTE is a risk factor for a first VTE.[88] Factor V Leiden, which makes factor V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C,[88] mildly increases VTE risk by about three times.[14][88] Deficiencies of three proteins that normally prevent blood from clotting—protein C, protein S, and antithrombin—contribute to VTE. These deficiencies in antithrombin, protein C, and protein S[c] are rare but strong, or moderately strong, risk factors.[62][56] They increase risk by about 10 times.[89]  Having a non-O blood type roughly doubles VTE risk.[56] Non-O blood type is common globally, making it an important risk factor.[90] Individuals without O blood type have higher blood levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII than those with O blood type, increasing the likelihood of clotting.[90] Those homozygous for the common fibrinogen gamma gene variant rs2066865 have about a 1.6 times higher risk of VTE.[91] The genetic variant prothrombin G20210A, which increases prothrombin levels,[62] increases risk by about 2.5 times.[14] Additionally, approximately 5% of people have been identified with a background genetic risk comparable to the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutations.[14]
 Blood alterations including dysfibrinogenemia,[65] low free protein S,[58] activated protein C resistance,[58] homocystinuria,[92] hyperhomocysteinemia,[62]  high fibrinogen levels,[62] high factor IX levels,[62] and high factor XI levels[62] are associated with increased risk. Other associated conditions include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome,[93] paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,[94] nephrotic syndrome,[58] chronic kidney disease,[95] polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia,[96] intravenous drug use,[97] and smoking.[d]
 Some risk factors influence the location of DVT within the body. In isolated distal DVT, the profile of risk factors appears distinct from proximal DVT. Transient factors, such as surgery and immobilization, appear to dominate, whereas thrombophilias[e] and age do not seem to increase risk.[101] Common risk factors for having an upper extremity DVT include having an existing foreign body (such as a central venous catheter, a pacemaker, or a triple-lumen PICC line), cancer, and recent surgery.[11]
 Blood has a natural tendency to clot when blood vessels are damaged (hemostasis) to minimize blood loss.[102] Clotting is activated by the coagulation cascade and the clearing of clots that are no longer needed is accomplished by the process of fibrinolysis. Reductions in fibrinolysis or increases in coagulation can increase the risk of DVT.[102]
 DVT often develops in the calf veins and ""grows"" in the direction of venous flow, towards the heart.[42][103] DVT most frequently affects veins in the leg or pelvis[9] including the popliteal vein (behind the knee), femoral vein (of the thigh), and iliac veins of the pelvis. Extensive lower-extremity DVT can even reach into the inferior vena cava (in the abdomen).[104] Upper extremity DVT most commonly affects the subclavian, axillary, and jugular veins.[11]
 The process of fibrinolysis, where DVT clots can be dissolved back into the blood, acts to temper the process of thrombus growth.[105] This is the preferred process. Aside from the potentially deadly process of embolization, a clot can resolve through organization, which can damage the valves of veins, cause vein fibrosis, and result in non-compliant veins.[106][107] Organization of a thrombus into the vein can occur at the third stage of its pathological development, in which collagen becomes the characteristic component. The first pathological stage is marked by red blood cells, and the second is characterized by medium-textured fibrin.[107]
 In arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation,[108] but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such mechanical damage.[62] The beginning of venous thrombosis is thought to arise from ""activation of endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes, with initiation of inflammation and formation of microparticles that trigger the coagulation system"" via tissue factor.[77] Vein wall inflammation is likely the inciting event.[77] Importantly, the activated endothelium of veins interacts with circulating white blood cells (leukocytes).[55] While leukocytes normally help prevent blood from clotting (as does normal endothelium), upon stimulation, leukocytes facilitate clotting.[109] Neutrophils are recruited early in the process of venous thrombi formation.[55] They release pro-coagulant granules[109] and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) or their components, which play a role in venous thrombi formation.[55][110] NET components are pro-thrombotic through both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways.[110] NETs provide ""a scaffold for adhesion"" of platelets, red blood cells, and multiple factors that potentiate platelet activation.[111] In addition to the pro-coagulant activities of neutrophils, multiple stimuli cause monocytes to release tissue factor.[109] Monocytes are also recruited early in the process.[55]
 Tissue factor, via the tissue factor–factor VIIa complex,[112] activates the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition.[86] Fresh venous clots are red blood cell and fibrin rich.[42] Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they can play a role.[56] In cancer, tissue factor is produced by cancer cells.[84] Cancer also produces unique substances that stimulate factor Xa, cytokines that promote endothelial dysfunction, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, which inhibits the breakdown of clots (fibrinolysis).[84]
 Often, DVT begins in the valves of veins.[105] The blood flow pattern in the valves can cause low oxygen concentrations in the blood (hypoxemia) of a valve sinus. Hypoxemia, which is worsened by venous stasis, activates pathways—ones that include hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1. Hypoxemia also results in the production of reactive oxygen species, which can activate these pathways, as well as nuclear factor-κB, which regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 transcription.[86] Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1 contribute to monocyte association with endothelial proteins, such as P-selectin, prompting monocytes to release tissue factor-filled microvesicles, which presumably begin clotting after binding to the endothelial surface.[86]
 D-dimers are a fibrin degradation product, a natural byproduct of fibrinolysis that is typically found in the blood. An elevated level[f] can result from plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions.[113] Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons.[39] Anticoagulation, the standard treatment for DVT, prevents further clot growth and PE, but does not act directly on existing clots.[114]
 A clinical probability assessment using the Wells score (see column in the table below) to determine if a potential DVT is ""likely"" or ""unlikely"" is typically the first step of the diagnostic process. The score is used in suspected first lower extremity DVT (without any PE symptoms) in primary care and outpatient settings, including the emergency department.[1][5] The numerical result (possible score −2 to 9) is most commonly grouped into either ""unlikely"" or ""likely"" categories.[1][5] A Wells score of two or more means DVT is considered ""likely"" (about a 28% chance), while those with a lower score are considered ""unlikely"" to have DVT (about a 6% chance).[39] In those unlikely to have DVT, a diagnosis is excluded by a negative D-dimer blood test.[1] In people with likely DVT, ultrasound is the standard imaging used to confirm or exclude a diagnosis.[5] Imaging is also needed for hospital inpatients with suspected DVT and those initially categorized as unlikely to have DVT but who have a positive D-dimer test.[1]
 While the Wells score is the predominant and most studied clinical prediction rule for DVT,[39][115] it does have drawbacks. The Wells score requires a subjective assessment regarding the likelihood of an alternate diagnosis and performs less well in the elderly and those with a prior DVT. The Dutch Primary Care Rule has also been validated for use. It contains only objective criteria but requires obtaining a D-dimer value.[116] With this prediction rule, three points or less means a person is at low risk for DVT. A result of four or more points indicates an ultrasound is needed.[116] Instead of using a prediction rule, experienced physicians can make a DVT pre-test probability assessment using clinical assessment and gestalt, but prediction rules are more reliable.[1]
 Compression ultrasonography for suspected deep vein thrombosis is the standard diagnostic method, and it is highly sensitive for detecting an initial DVT.[118] A compression ultrasound is considered positive when the vein walls of normally compressible veins do not collapse under gentle pressure.[39] Clot visualization is sometimes possible, but is not required.[119] Three compression ultrasound scanning techniques can be used, with two of the three methods requiring a second ultrasound some days later to rule out the diagnosis.[118] Whole-leg ultrasound is the option that does not require a repeat ultrasound,[118] but proximal compression ultrasound is frequently used because distal DVT is only rarely clinically significant.[117] Ultrasound methods including duplex and color flow Doppler can be used to further characterize the clot[117] and Doppler ultrasound is especially helpful in the non-compressible iliac veins.[119]
 CT scan venography, MRI venography, or a non-contrast MRI are also diagnostic possibilities.[120] The gold standard for judging imaging methods is contrast venography, which involves injecting a peripheral vein of the affected limb with a contrast agent and taking X-rays, to reveal whether the venous supply has been obstructed. Because of its cost, invasiveness, availability, and other limitations, this test is rarely performed.[39]
 Treatment for DVT is warranted when the clots are either proximal, distal and symptomatic, or upper extremity and symptomatic.[2] Providing anticoagulation, or blood-thinning medicine, is the typical treatment after patients are checked to make sure they are not subject to bleeding.[2][i] However, treatment varies depending upon the location of DVT. For example, in cases of isolated distal DVT, ultrasound surveillance (a second ultrasound after 2 weeks to check for proximal clots), might be used instead of anticoagulation.[5][124] Although, those with isolated distal DVT at a high-risk of VTE recurrence are typically anticoagulated as if they had proximal DVT. Those at a low-risk for recurrence might receive a four to six week course of anticoagulation, lower doses, or no anticoagulation at all.[5] In contrast, those with proximal DVT should receive at least 3 months of anticoagulation.[5]
 Some anticoagulants can be taken by mouth, and these oral medicines include warfarin (a vitamin K antagonist), rivaroxaban (a factor Xa inhibitor), apixaban (a factor Xa inhibitor), dabigatran (a direct thrombin inhibitor), and edoxaban (a factor Xa inhibitor).[2] Other anticoagulants cannot be taken by mouth. These parenteral (non-oral) medicines include low-molecular-weight heparin, fondaparinux, and unfractionated heparin. Some oral medicines are sufficient when taken alone, while others require the use of an additional parenteral blood thinner. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are the typical first-line medicines, and they are sufficient when taken orally.[19] Rivaroxaban is taken once daily, and apixaban is taken twice daily.[5]  Warfarin, dabigatran, and edoxaban require the use of a parenteral anticoagulant to initiate oral anticoagulant therapy.[19][125]  When warfarin is initiated for VTE treatment, a 5-day minimum of a parenteral anticoagulant[j] together with warfarin is given, which is followed by warfarin-only therapy.[17][18] Warfarin is taken to maintain an international normalized ratio (INR)[k] of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target.[128] The benefit of taking warfarin declines as the duration of treatment extends,[129] and the risk of bleeding increases with age.[130] Periodic INR monitoring is not necessary when first-line direct oral anticoagulants are used. Overall, anticoagulation therapy is complex and many circumstances can affect how these therapies are managed.[131]
 The duration of anticoagulation therapy (whether it will last 4 to 6 weeks,[5] 6 to 12 weeks, 3 to 6 months,[19] or indefinitely) is a key factor in clinical decision making.[52] When proximal DVT is provoked by surgery or trauma a 3-month course of anticoagulation is standard.[19] When a first VTE is proximal DVT that is either unprovoked or associated with transient non-surgical risk factor, low-dose anticoagulation beyond 3 to 6 months might be used.[19] In those with an annual risk of VTE in excess of 9%, as after an unprovoked episode, extended anticoagulation is a possibility.[132] Those who finish warfarin treatment after idiopathic VTE with an elevated D-dimer level show an increased risk of recurrent VTE (about 9% vs about 4% for normal results), and this result might be used in clinical decision making.[133] Thrombophilia test results rarely play a role in the length of treatment.[80]
 Treatment for acute leg DVT is suggested to continue at home for uncomplicated DVT instead of hospitalization. Factors that favor hospitalization include severe symptoms or additional medical issues.[12] Early walking is suggested over bedrest.[134] Graduated compression stockings—which apply higher pressure at the ankles and a lower pressure around the knees[126] can be trialed for symptomatic management of acute DVT symptoms, but they are not recommended for reducing the risk of post-thrombotic syndrome,[125] as the potential benefit of using them for this goal ""may be uncertain"".[5] Nor are compression stockings likely to reduce VTE recurrence.[135] They are, however, recommended in those with isolated distal DVT.[5]
 If someone decides to stop anticoagulation after an unprovoked VTE instead of being on lifelong anticoagulation, aspirin can be used to reduce the risk of recurrence,[136] but it is only about 33% as effective as anticoagulation in preventing recurrent VTE.[52] Statins have also been investigated for their potential to reduce recurrent VTE rates, with some studies suggesting effectiveness.[137]
 An unprovoked VTE might signal the presence of an unknown cancer, as it is an underlying condition in up to 10% of unprovoked cases.[1] A thorough clinical assessment is needed and should include a physical examination, a review of medical history, and universal cancer screening done in people of that age.[19][138] A review of prior imaging is considered worthwhile, as is ""reviewing baseline blood test results including full blood count, renal and hepatic function, PT and APTT.""[138] It is not recommended practice to obtain tumor markers or a CT of the abdomen and pelvis in asymptomatic individuals.[1] NICE recommends that further investigations are unwarranted in those without relevant signs or symptoms.[138]
 Thrombolysis is the injection of an enzyme into the veins to dissolve blood clots, and while this treatment has been proven effective against the life-threatening emergency clots of stroke and heart attacks, randomized controlled trials[139][140][141] have not established a net benefit in those with acute proximal DVT.[5][142] Drawbacks of catheter-directed thrombolysis (the preferred method of administering the clot-busting enzyme[5]) include a risk of bleeding, complexity,[l] and the cost of the procedure.[125] Although, while anticoagulation is the preferred treatment for DVT,[125] thrombolysis is a treatment option for those with the severe DVT form of phlegmasia cerula dorens (bottom left image) and in some younger patients with DVT affecting the iliac and common femoral veins.[12] Of note, a variety of contraindications to thrombolysis exist.[125] In 2020, NICE kept their 2012 recommendations that catheter-directed thrombolysis should be considered in those with iliofemoral DVT who have ""symptoms lasting less than 14 days, good functional status, a life expectancy of 1 year or more, and a low risk of bleeding.""[138]
 A mechanical thrombectomy device can remove DVT clots, particularly in acute iliofemoral DVT (DVT of the major veins in the pelvis), but there is limited data on its efficacy. It is usually combined with thrombolysis, and sometimes temporary IVC filters are placed to protect against PE during the procedure.[143] Catheter-directed thrombolysis with thrombectomy[141] against iliofemoral DVT has been associated with a reduction in the severity of post-thrombotic syndrome at an estimated cost-effectiveness ratio of about $138,000[m] per gained QALY.[144][145] Phlegmasia cerulea dolens might be treated with catheter-directed thrombolysis and/or thrombectomy.[19][143]
 In DVT in the arm, the first (topmost) rib can be surgically removed as part of the typical treatment when the DVT is due to thoracic outlet syndrome or Paget–Schroetter syndrome. This treatment involves initial anticoagulation followed by thrombolysis of the subclavian vein and staged first rib resection to relieve the thoracic outlet compression and prevent recurrent DVT.[146]
 The placement of an inferior vena cava filter (IVC filter) is possible when either the standard treatment for acute DVT, anticoagulation, is absolutely contraindicated (not possible), or if someone develops a PE despite being anticoagulated.[138] However, a 2020 NICE review found ""little good evidence"" for their use.[138] A 2018 study associated IVC filter placement with a 50% reduction in PE, a 70% increase in DVT, and an 18% increase in 30 day mortality when compared to no IVC placement.[1][148] Other studies including a systematic review and meta-analysis did not find a difference in mortality with IVC placement.[30] If someone develops a PE despite being anticoagulated, care should be given to optimize anticoagulation treatment and address other related concerns before considering IVC filter placement.[138]
 Patients with a history of DVT might be managed by primary care, general internal medicine, hematology, cardiology, vascular surgery, or vascular medicine.[149] Patients suspected of having an acute DVT are often referred to the emergency department for evaluation.[150] Interventional radiology is the specialty that typically places and retrieves IVC filters,[151] and vascular surgery might do catheter directed thrombosis for some severe DVTs.[147]
 For the prevention of blood clots in the general population, incorporating leg exercises while sitting down for long periods, or having breaks from a sitting position and walking around, having an active lifestyle, and maintaining a healthy body weight are recommended.[6] Walking increases blood flow through the leg veins.[152] Excess body weight is modifiable unlike most risk factors, and interventions or lifestyle modifications that help someone who is overweight or obese lose weight reduce DVT risk.[88] Avoiding both smoking and a Western pattern diet are thought to reduce risk.[153] Statins have been investigated for primary prevention (prevention of a first VTE), and the JUPITER trial, which used rosuvastatin, has provided some tentative evidence of effectiveness.[14][154] Of the statins, rosuvastatin appears to be the only one with the potential to reduce VTE risk.[155] If so, it appears to reduce risk by about 15%.[153] However, the number needed to treat to prevent one initial VTE is about 2000, limiting its applicability.[156]
 Acutely ill hospitalized patients are suggested to receive a parenteral anticoagulant, although the potential net benefit is uncertain.[63] Critically ill hospitalized patients are recommended to either receive unfractionated heparin or low-molecular weight heparin instead of foregoing these medicines.[63]
 Major orthopedic surgery—total hip replacement, total knee replacement, or hip fracture surgery—has a high risk of causing VTE.[157] If prophylaxis is not used after these surgeries, symptomatic VTE has about a 4% chance of developing within 35 days.[158] Following major orthopedic surgery, a blood thinner or aspirin is typically paired with intermittent pneumatic compression, which is the preferred mechanical prophylaxis over graduated compression stockings.[7]
 Options for VTE prevention in people following non-orthopedic surgery include early walking, mechanical prophylaxis, and blood thinners (low-molecular-weight heparin and low-dose-unfractionated heparin) depending upon the risk of VTE, risk of major bleeding, and person's preferences.[159] After low-risk surgeries, early and frequent walking is the best preventive measure.[7]
 The risk of VTE is increased in pregnancy by about four to five times because of a more hypercoagulable state that protects against fatal postpartum hemorrhage.[28] Preventive measures for pregnancy-related VTE were suggested by the American Society of Hematology in 2018.[160] Warfarin, a common vitamin K antagonist, can cause birth defects and is not used for prevention during pregnancy.[161]
 Travelling ""is an often cited yet relatively uncommon"" cause of VTE.[28] Suggestions for at-risk[n] long-haul travelers include calf exercises, frequent walking, and aisle seating in airplanes to ease walking.[162][163] Graduated compression stockings have sharply reduced the levels of asymptomatic DVT in airline passengers, but the effect on symptomatic DVT, PE, or mortality is unknown, as none of the individuals studied developed these outcomes.[164] However, graduated compression stockings are not suggested for long-haul travelers (>4 hours) without risk factors for VTE. Likewise, neither aspirin nor anticoagulants are suggested in the general population undertaking long-haul travel.[63] Those with significant VTE risk factors[o] undertaking long-haul travel are suggested to use either graduated compression stockings or LMWH for VTE prevention. If neither of these two methods are feasible, then aspirin is suggested.[63]
 DVT is most frequently a disease of older age that occurs in the context of nursing homes, hospitals, and active cancer.[3] It is associated with a 30-day mortality rate of about 6%, with PE being the cause of most of these deaths.[1] Proximal DVT is frequently associated with PE, unlike distal DVT, which is rarely if ever associated with PE.[39] Around 56% of those with proximal DVT also have PE, although a chest CT is not needed simply because of the presence of DVT.[1] If proximal DVT is left untreated, in the following 3 months approximately half of people will experience symptomatic PE.[9]
 Another frequent complication of proximal DVT, and the most frequent chronic complication, is post-thrombotic syndrome, where individuals have chronic venous symptoms.[5] Symptoms can include pain, itching, swelling, paresthesia, a sensation of heaviness, and in severe cases, leg ulcers.[5] After proximal DVT, an estimated 20–50% of people develop the syndrome, with 5–10% experiencing severe symptoms.[165] Post-thrombotic syndrome can also be a complication of distal DVT, though to a lesser extent than with proximal DVT.[166]
 In the 10 years following an initial VTE, about 30% of people will have a recurrence.[3] VTE recurrence in those with prior DVT is more likely to recur as DVT than PE.[167] Cancer[5] and unprovoked DVT are strong risk factors for recurrence.[60] After initial proximal unprovoked DVT with and without PE, 16–17% of people will have recurrent VTE in the 2 years after they complete their course of anticoagulants. VTE recurrence is less common in distal DVT than proximal DVT.[44][45] In upper extremity DVT, annual VTE recurrence is about 2–4%.[130] After surgery, a provoked proximal DVT or PE has an annual recurrence rate of only 0.7%.[60]
 About 1.5 out of 1000 adults a year have a first VTE in high-income countries.[168][169] The condition becomes much more common with age.[3] VTE rarely occurs in children, but when it does, it predominantly affects hospitalized children.[170] Children in North America and the Netherlands have VTE rates that range from 0.07 to 0.49 out of 10,000 children annually.[170] Meanwhile, almost 1% of those aged 85 and above experience VTE each year.[3] About 60% of all VTEs occur in those 70 years of age or older.[9] Incidence is about 18% higher in males than in females,[4] though there are ages when VTE is more prevalent in women.[15] VTE occurs in association with hospitalization or nursing home residence about 60% of the time, active cancer about 20% of the time, and a central venous catheter or transvenous pacemaker about 9% of the time.[3]
 During pregnancy and after childbirth, acute VTE occurs in about 1.2 of 1000 deliveries. Despite it being relatively rare, it is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality.[160] After surgery with preventive treatment, VTE develops in about 10 of 1000 people after total or partial knee replacement, and in about 5 of 1000 after total or partial hip replacement.[171] About 400,000 Americans develop an initial VTE each year, with 100,000 deaths or more attributable to PE.[169]  Asian, Asian-American, Native American, and Hispanic individuals have a lower VTE risk than Whites or Blacks.[4][15] Populations in Asia have VTE rates at 15 to 20% of what is seen in Western countries, with an increase in incidence seen over time.[16] In North American and European populations, around 4–8% of people have a thrombophilia,[89] most commonly factor V leiden and prothrombin G20210A. For populations in China, Japan, and Thailand, deficiences in protein S, protein C, and antithrombin predominate.[172] Non-O blood type is present in around 50% of the general population and varies with ethnicity, and it is present in about 70% of those with VTE.[90][173]
 DVT occurs in the upper extremities in about 4–10% of cases,[11] with an incidence of 0.4–1.0 people out of 10,000 a year.[5] A minority of upper extremity DVTs are due to Paget–Schroetter syndrome, also called effort thrombosis, which occurs in 1–2 people out of 100,000 a year, usually in athletic males around 30 years of age or in those who do significant amounts of overhead manual labor.[69][147]
 Being on blood thinners because of DVT can be life-changing because it can prevent lifestyle activities such as contact or winter sports to prevent bleeding after potential injuries.[175] Head injuries prompting brain bleeds are of particular concern. This has caused NASCAR driver Brian Vickers to forego participation in races. Professional basketball players including NBA players Chris Bosh and hall of famer Hakeem Olajuwon have dealt with recurrent blood clots,[176] and Bosh's career was significantly hampered by DVT and PE.[177]
 Tennis star Serena Williams was hospitalized in 2011 for PE thought to have originated from DVT.[178] Years later, in 2017, due to her knowledge of DVT and PE, Serena accurately advocated for herself to have a PE diagnosed and treated. During this encounter with VTE, she was hospitalized after a C-section surgery and was off of blood thinners. After feeling the sudden onset of a PE symptom, shortness of breath, she told her nurse and requested a CT scan and an IV heparin drip, all while gasping for air. She started to receive an ultrasound to look for DVT in the legs, prompting her to express dissatisfaction to the medical staff that they were not looking for clots where she had symptoms (her lungs), and they were not yet treating her presumed PE. After being diagnosed with PE and not DVT, and after receiving heparin by IV, the coughing from the PE caused her C-section surgical site to open and the heparin contributed to bleeding at the site. Serena later received an IVC filter while in the hospital.[174][179]
 Other notable people have been affected by DVT. Former United States (US) President Richard Nixon had recurrent DVT,[180] and so has former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She was first diagnosed while First Lady in 1998 and again in 2009.[181] Dick Cheney was diagnosed with an episode while Vice President,[182] and TV show host Regis Philbin had DVT after hip-replacement surgery.[183] DVT has also contributed to the deaths of famous people. For example, DVT and PE played a role in rapper Heavy D's death at age 44.[184] NBC journalist David Bloom died at age 39 while covering the Iraq War from a PE that was thought to have progressed from a missed DVT,[185] and actor Jimmy Stewart had DVT that progressed to a PE when he was 89.[183][186]
 The book Sushruta Samhita, an Ayurvedic text published around 600–900 BC, contains what has been cited as the first description of DVT.[187] In 1271, DVT symptoms in the leg of a 20-year-old male were described in a French manuscript, which has been cited as the first case or the first Western reference to DVT.[187][188]
 In 1856, German physician and pathologist Rudolf Virchow published his analysis after the insertion of foreign bodies into the jugular veins of dogs, which migrated to the pulmonary arteries. These foreign bodies caused pulmonary emboli, and Virchow was focused on explaining their consequences.[189] He cited three factors, which are now understood as hypercoaguability, stasis, and endothelial injury.[190] It was not until 1950 that this framework was cited as Virchow's triad,[189] but the teaching of Virchow's triad has continued in light of its utility as a theoretical framework and as a recognition of the significant progress Virchow made in expanding the understanding of VTE.[189][190]
 Methods to observe DVT by ultrasound were established in the 1960s.[120] Diagnoses were commonly performed by impedance plethysmography in the 1970s and 1980s,[191] but ultrasound, particularly after utility of probe compression was demonstrated in 1986, became the preferred diagnostic method.[187] Yet, in the mid-1990s, contrast venography and impedance plethysmography were still described as common.[192]
 Multiple pharmacological therapies for DVT were introduced in the 20th century: oral anticoagulants in the 1940s, subcutaneous injections of LDUH in 1962 and subcutaneous injections of LMWH in 1982.[193] 1974 was when vascular inflammation and venous thrombosis were first proposed to be interrelated.[112] For around 50 years, a months-long warfarin (Coumadin) regimen was the mainstay of pharmacological treatment.[194][195] To avoid the blood monitoring required with warfarin and the injections required by heparin and heparin-like medicines, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were developed.[195] In the late 2000s to early 2010s, DOACs—including rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), and dabigatran (Pradaxa)—came to the market.[60] The New York Times described a ""furious battle"" among the three makers of these drugs ""for the prescription pads of doctors"".[194]
 VTE costs the US healthcare system about $7 to 10 billion dollars annually.[169] Initial and average DVT costs for a hospitalized US patient is about $10,000 (2015 estimate).[196]  In Europe, the costs for an initial VTE hospitalization are significantly less, costing about €2000 to 4000 (2011 estimate).[197] Post-thrombotic syndrome is a significant contributor to DVT follow-up costs.[198] Outpatient treatment significantly reduces costs, and treatment costs for PE exceed those of DVT.[199]
 A 2019 study published in Nature Genetics reported more than doubling the known genetic loci associated with VTE.[14] In their updated 2018 clinical practice guidelines, the American Society of Hematology identified 29 separate research priorities, most of which related to patients who are acutely or critically ill.[63] Inhibition of factor XI, P-selectin, E-selectin, and a reduction in formation of neutrophil extracellular traps are potential therapies that might treat VTE without increasing bleeding risk.[200]

"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one or more of the deep veins in the body, usually in the legs. Deep vein thrombosis can cause leg pain or swelling. Sometimes there are no noticeable symptoms. 
        A blood clot in a leg vein may cause pain, warmth and tenderness in the affected area.
         You can get deep vein thrombosis (DVT) if you have certain medical conditions that affect how the blood clots. A blood clot in the legs can also develop if you don't move for a long time. For example, you might not move a lot when traveling a long distance or when you're on bed rest due to surgery, an illness or an accident. Deep vein thrombosis can be serious because blood clots in the veins can break loose. The clots can then travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in the lungs, blocking blood flow (pulmonary embolism). When DVT and pulmonary embolism occur together, it's called venous thromboembolism (VTE). Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) symptoms can include: Deep vein thrombosis can occur without noticeable symptoms. If you develop symptoms of DVT, contact your health care provider. If you develop symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (PE) — a life-threatening complication of deep vein thrombosis — seek emergency medical help. The warning signs and symptoms of a pulmonary embolism include: 
        A pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a blood clot gets stuck in an artery in the lung, blocking blood flow to part of the lung. Blood clots most often start in the legs and travel up through the right side of the heart and into the lungs. This is called deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
         Anything that prevents the blood from flowing or properly clotting can cause a blood clot. The main causes of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are damage to a vein from surgery or inflammation and damage due to infection or injury. Many things can increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The more risk factors you have, the greater your risk of DVT. Risk factors for DVT include: Sometimes, a blood clot in a vein can occur with no identifiable risk factor. This is called an unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE). Complications of DVT can include: Pulmonary embolism (PE). PE is a potentially life-threatening complication associated with DVT. It occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) in a leg or other body area breaks free and gets stuck in a blood vessel in a lung. Get immediate medical help if you have symptoms of PE. They include sudden shortness of breath, chest pain while breathing in or coughing, rapid breathing, rapid pulse, feeling faint or fainting, and coughing up blood. Lifestyle changes may help prevent deep vein thrombosis. Try these strategies: Move your legs. If you've had surgery or have been on bed rest, try to move as soon as possible. Don't cross your legs while sitting. Doing so can block blood flow. When traveling, take frequent breaks to stretch your legs. When on a plane, stand or walk occasionally. If you're traveling by car, stop every hour or so and walk around. If you can't walk, do lower leg exercises. Raise and lower your heels while keeping your toes on the floor.

"Deep vein thrombosis is a blood clot in a vein located deep within your body, usually in your leg. Get treatment right away so you can prevent serious complications. Treatments include medicines, compression stockings and surgery. Be patient. You may need to take medicine for a few months and wear compression stockings for two years. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT, also called venous thrombosis) occurs when a thrombus (blood clot) develops in veins deep in your body because your veins are injured or the blood flowing through them is too sluggish. The blood clots may partially or completely block blood flow through your vein. Most DVTs happen in your lower leg, thigh or pelvis, but they also can occur in other parts of your body including your arm, brain, intestines, liver or kidney. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Even though DVT itself is not life-threatening, the blood clots have the potential to break free and travel through your bloodstream. A pulmonary embolism (PE) happens when the traveling blood clots (emboli) become lodged in the blood vessels of your lung. Since this can be a life-threatening condition, you need a quick diagnosis and treatment. As many as half of those who get a DVT in their legs develop symptoms of intermittent leg pain and swelling that may last months to years. These symptoms are called post-thrombotic syndrome and can happen because of damage to the valves and inner lining of your veins leading to blood “pooling” more than it should. This increases the pressure inside your veins and causes pain and swelling. Characteristics of this condition include: A superficial venous thrombosis (also called phlebitis or superficial thrombophlebitis) is when blood clots develop in a vein close to the surface of your skin. These types of blood clots rarely travel to your lungs unless they move from the superficial system into the deep venous system first. While a physician can diagnose superficial vein clots with a physical exam, they can only diagnose DVT with an ultrasound. Advertisement Each year, approximately 1 to 3 in every 1,000 adults develop a DVT or pulmonary embolism in the United States, and up to 300,000 people die each year as a result of DVT/PE. It’s the third most common vascular disease, behind heart attacks and strokes. Acute DVT/PE can occur at any age, but are less common in children and adolescents and more common in those over the age of 60. More than half of all DVTs happen as a result of being in the hospital from a medical illness or following surgery. The reason why DVTs are more common after a hospital stay is because you’re lying in bed most of the time instead of moving around like you normally would. A DVT usually forms in the veins of your legs or arms. Up to 30%of people with a DVT don’t have symptoms, but sometimes the symptoms are very mild and may not raise concern. The symptoms associated with an acute DVT include: Some people don’t know they have a DVT until the clot moves from their leg or arm and travels to their lung. Symptoms of acute PE include chest pain, shortness of breath, cough with blood, lightheadedness and fainting. It’s important to call your doctor right away or go to the emergency room if you have symptoms of a DVT. Don’t wait to see if your symptoms go away. Get treatment right away to prevent serious complications. Advertisement These conditions can increase your risk of a deep vein thrombosis: Your healthcare provider will do a physical exam and review your medical history. You’ll also need to have imaging tests. Duplex venous ultrasound. This is the most common test for diagnosing a DVT because it is non-invasive and widely available. This test uses ultrasound waves to show blood flow and blood clots in your veins. A vascular ultrasound technologist applies pressure while scanning your arm or leg. If the pressure doesn’t make your vein compress, it could mean there’s a blood clot. If the results of the duplex ultrasound aren’t clear, your provider can use another imaging test Venography. In this invasive test, your provider numbs the skin of your neck or groin and uses a catheter to inject a special dye (contrast material) into your veins to see if any blood clots are partially or completely blocking blood flow inside your veins. Venography is rarely used nowadays, but sometimes it is necessary Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRV). MRI shows pictures of organs and structures inside your body. MRV shows pictures of the veins in specific locations in your body. In many cases, MRI and MRV can offer more information than a duplex ultrasound or CT scan. Computed tomography (CT) scan is a type of X-ray that shows structures inside your body. Your provider may use a CT scan to find a DVT in your abdomen, pelvis or brain, as well as blood clots in your lung (pulmonary embolism). If your doctor thinks you may have a genetic or acquired clotting disorder, you may need to have special blood tests. This may be important if: A DVT may make it harder for you to get around at first because of leg pain and swelling. But you’ll be able to slowly return to your normal activities. If your legs feel swollen or heavy, lie in bed with your heels propped up about 5 to 6 inches. This helps improve circulation and decreases swelling. In addition: Some people with a DVT may need to be treated in the hospital. Others may be able to have outpatient treatment. Treatments include medications called anticoagulants (blood thinners), compression stockings and elevating your affected leg(s) at different times throughout the day. In a minority of cases, when the DVT is extensive, invasive treatments (catheter-based procedures) may be required. The main goals of treatment are to: Anticoagulants (blood thinners) This type of medication makes it harder for your blood to clot. Anticoagulants also stop clots from getting bigger and prevent blood clots from moving. Anticoagulants don’t destroy or “melt” blood clots. Your body may naturally dissolve a clot, but sometimes clots don’t completely disappear. When they don’t, they usually shrink and become little “scars” inside your veins. Sometimes these “old” clots may result in leg swelling, but oftentimes they don’t cause symptoms. There are different types of anticoagulants: warfarin, heparin and oral Xa inhibitors. Your doctor will talk to you about the best type of medication for you. If you need to take an anticoagulant, you may have to take it for only a few months (usually three to six months) or you might take it indefinitely. Your treatment time may be different depending on the specific situations of each individual, including if: Bleeding is the most common side effect of anticoagulants. You should call your doctor right away if you notice that you bruise or bleed easily while taking this medication. You‘ll probably need to wear graded elastic compression stockings to either improve or completely get rid of leg swelling. Damage to the small valves inside your veins often causes this swelling. You may also have swelling because the DVT is blocking blood flow in your vein. You wear most compression stockings just below your knee. These stockings are tight at the ankle and become looser as they go away from your ankle. This causes gentle pressure (compression) on your leg. Some people need to wear these for two years or more. Several clinical studies have shown that compression stockings improve the symptoms of leg pain and swelling by at least 50% as long as they’re worn daily from morning to evening (they don’t have to be worn overnight). After surgery, your providers may put compression devices on your calves to put pressure on them. These machines squeeze and release the fabric-covered devices around your calves while you’re lying in bed. These devices help prevent a DVT if you’re in the hospital, but they aren’t prescribed outside of the hospital. In addition, unlike compression stockings that you can wear safely when a leg DVT is present, you shouldn’t use these devices for DVT prevention if you have a DVT. When you can’t take medications to thin your blood or you have blood clots while taking blood thinners without missing doses, a surgeon may have to do a procedure to put in an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The procedure is done under local anesthesia. Your surgeon inserts the IVC filter through a catheter into a large vein in your groin or neck, and then into your vena cava (the largest vein in your body). If blood clots in the veins of your legs break off and travel, the IVC filter is designed to prevent large blood clots (emboli) from reaching your lungs and causing a pulmonary embolism. While an IVC filter helps prevent a pulmonary embolism, it doesn’t keep more blood clots from forming in your veins. After you have a DVT, you’ll need to reduce your risk of future DVT/PE clots by: If you’ve never had a DVT, but have an increased risk of developing one, be sure to: A DVT can take several months to a year to come apart, so you’ll need to keep taking blood thinner medicines as instructed and keep wearing compression stockings until your provider tells you to stop. You may need blood tests to make sure you’re getting the right dose of blood thinners. Your provider may want to do more ultrasounds later to find out if your blood clot is still in the same place, improving or getting larger. Tell your healthcare provider if your symptoms aren’t getting better. You should also tell them if you’re bruising too easily or have heavy periods. You should get emergency care if the blood thinners you’re taking make you bleed too much, or cause problems like bright red blood in vomit or poop. A note from Cleveland Clinic If you have a deep vein thrombosis, you’re not alone. Every year, at least 1 million Americans get one.

"Depression is a common mental health condition that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and changes in how you think, sleep, eat and act. There are several different types. Depression is treatable — usually with talk therapy, medication or both. Seeking medical help as soon as you have symptoms is essential. Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in things and activities you once enjoyed. It can also cause difficulty with thinking, memory, eating and sleeping. It’s normal to feel sad about or grieve over difficult life situations, such as losing your job or a divorce. But depression is different in that it persists practically every day for at least two weeks and involves other symptoms than sadness alone. There are several types of depressive disorders. Clinical depression, or major depressive disorder, is often just called “depression.” It’s the most severe type of depression. Without treatment, depression can get worse and last longer. In severe cases, it can lead to self-harm or death by suicide. The good news is that treatments can be very effective in improving symptoms.

Policy The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) classifies depressive disorders as the following: There are also specific forms of major depressive disorder, including: People with bipolar disorder also experience episodes of depression in addition to manic or hypomanic episodes. Depression can affect anyone — including children and adults. Women and people assigned female at birth are more likely to have depression than men and people assigned male at birth. Having certain risk factors makes it more likely that you may develop depression. For example, the following conditions are associated with higher rates of depression: Advertisement Depression is common. Researchers estimate that nearly 7% of adults in the United States have depression every year. More than 16% of U.S. adults — around 1 in 6 people — will experience depression at some point in their lifetime. However, researchers believe that these estimates are lower than reality, as many people don’t seek medical help for symptoms of depression and don’t receive a diagnosis. Approximately 4.4% of children in the United States have depression. The symptoms of depression can vary slightly depending on the type and can range from mild to severe. In general, symptoms include: If you or a loved one are thinking about suicide, dial 988 on your phone to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. Someone will be available to help you 24/7. Advertisement Researchers don’t know the exact cause of depression. They think that several factors contribute to its development, including: Healthcare providers diagnose depression based on a thorough understanding of your symptoms, medical history and mental health history. They may diagnose you with a specific type of depression, such as seasonal affective disorder or postpartum depression, based on the context of your symptoms. To receive a diagnosis of depression, you must have five depression symptoms every day, nearly all day, for at least two weeks. Your provider may order medical tests, such as blood tests, to see if any underlying medical conditions are causing your depressive symptoms. Depression is one of the most treatable mental health conditions. Approximately 80% to 90% of people with depression who seek treatment eventually respond well to treatment. Treatment options include: There are also things you can do at home to help improve depression symptoms, including: You can’t always prevent depression, but you can help reduce your risk by: If you’ve had depression before, you may be more likely to experience it again. If you have depression symptoms, get help as soon as possible. The prognosis (outlook) of depression varies depending on certain factors, including: With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression live healthy, fulfilling lives. Depression can return after you get treatment, though, so it’s important to seek medical help as soon as symptoms begin again. Without treatment, depression can: Depression accounts for nearly 40,000 cases of suicide each year in the United States. It’s essential to get medical help as soon as possible if you’re having suicidal thoughts. Call 911 or 988 (the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline) or go to the emergency room. If you have symptoms of depression, see a healthcare provider or mental health professional. They can give you an accurate diagnosis and suggest treatment options. If you’ve started treatment for depression and it isn’t working or you’re having unpleasant side effects, talk to your provider. They can recommend a different treatment plan. A note from Cleveland Clinic Depression is a common condition that affects millions of people every year. Anyone can experience depression — even if there doesn’t seem to be a reason for it. The good news is that depression is treatable. If you have symptoms of depression, talk to your healthcare provider. The sooner you get help, the sooner you can feel better.

"Depression can be temporary or long-term. You may find help with mediation or different therapies, such as cognitive behavior therapy. It’s important to seek professional help if you’re feeling major depression. If you think someone is considering suicide, get help from a crisis or suicide prevention hotline. Try the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988. Depression is classified as a mood disorder. It may be described as feelings of sadness, loss, or anger that interfere with a person’s everyday activities. It’s also fairly common. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 18.5 percent of American adults had symptoms of depression in any given 2-week period in 2019.  Though depression and grief share some features, depression is different from grief felt after losing a loved one or sadness felt after a traumatic life event. Depression usually involves self-loathing or a loss of self-esteem, while grief typically does not. In grief, positive emotions and happy memories of the deceased typically accompany feelings of emotional pain. In major depressive disorder, the feelings of sadness are constant. People experience depression in different ways. It may interfere with your daily work, resulting in lost time and lower productivity. It can also influence relationships and some chronic health conditions. Conditions that can get worse due to depression include: It’s important to realize that feeling down at times is a normal part of life. Sad and upsetting events happen to everyone. But if you’re feeling down or hopeless on a regular basis, you could be dealing with depression. Depression is considered a serious medical condition that can get worse without proper treatment.  Depression can be more than a constant state of sadness or feeling “blue.” Major depression can cause a variety of symptoms. Some affect your mood and others affect your body. Symptoms may also be ongoing or come and go.  Not everyone with depression will experience the same symptoms. Symptoms can vary in severity, how often they happen, and how long they last. If you experience some of the following signs and symptoms of depression nearly every day for at least 2 weeks, you may be living with depression: The symptoms of depression can be experienced differently among males, females, teens, and children. Males may experience symptoms related to their: Females may experience symptoms related to their: Children may experience symptoms related to their: There are several possible causes of depression. They can range from biological to circumstantial. Common causes include: Risk factors for depression can be biochemical, medical, social, genetic, or circumstantial. Common risk factors include:  The causes of depression are often tied to other elements of your health. You may successfully manage symptoms with one form of treatment, or you may find that a combination of treatments works best.  It’s common to combine medical treatments and lifestyle therapies, including the following: Your healthcare professional may prescribe: SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed antidepressant medications and tend to have few side effects. They treat depression by increasing the availability of the neurotransmitter serotonin in your brain.  SSRIs should not be taken with certain drugs including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and in some cases thioridazine or Orap (pimozide). People who are pregnant should talk to their healthcare professionals about the risks of taking SSRIs during pregnancy. You should also use caution if you have narrow-angle glaucoma.  Examples of SSRIs include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Paxil, Paxil XR, Pexeva), and sertraline (Zoloft). SNRIs treat depression by increasing the amount of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine in your brain. SNRIs should not be taken with MAOIs. You should use caution if you have liver or kidney problems, or narrow-angle glaucoma. Examples of SNRIs include desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla), duloxetine (Cymbalta, Irenka), levomilnacipran (Fetzima), and venlafaxine (Effexor XR). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and tetracyclic antidepressants (TECAs) treat depression by increasing the amount of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine in your brain.  TCAs can cause more side effects than SSRIs or SNRIs. Do not take TCAs or TECAs with MAOIs. Use with caution if you have narrow-angle glaucoma.  Examples of tricyclic antidepressants include amitriptyline (Elavil), doxepin (Sinequan), imipramine (Tofranil), trimipramine (Surmontil), desipramine (Norpramin), nortriptyline (Pamelor, Aventyl), and protriptyline (Vivactil).  These drugs can treat depression by increasing the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline in your brain. Examples of NDRIs include bupropion (Wellbutrin).  MAOIs treat depression by increasing the levels of norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and tyramine in your brain.  Due to side effects and safety concerns, MAOIs are not the first choice for treating mental health disorders. They are typically used only if other medications are unsuccessful at treating depression.  Examples of MAOIs include isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Emsam), tranylcypromine (Parnate). N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists treat depression by increasing levels of glutamate in the brain. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter believed to be involved in depression. NMDA antagonists are used only in patients who have not had success with other antidepressant treatments. The FDA has approved one NMDA medication, esketamine (Spravato), for the treatment of depression.  Esketamine is a nasal spray that is only available through a restricted program called Spravato REMS. Patients may experience tiredness and dissociation (difficulty with attention, judgment, and thinking) after taking the medication. For this reason, esketamine is administered in a healthcare setting where a healthcare professional can monitor for sedation and dissociation. Each type of medication that’s used to treat depression has benefits and potential risks. Speaking with a therapist can help you learn skills to cope with negative feelings. You may also benefit from family or group therapy sessions. Psychotherapy, also known as “talk therapy,” is when a person speaks to a trained therapist to identify and learn to cope with the factors that contribute to their mental health condition, such as depression. Psychotherapy has been shown to be an effective treatment in improving symptoms in people with depression and other psychiatric disorders. Psychotherapy is often used alongside pharmaceutical treatment. There are many different types of psychotherapy, and some people respond better to one type than another.  In cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a therapist will work with you to uncover unhealthy patterns of thought and identify how they may be causing harmful behaviors, reactions, and beliefs about yourself. Your therapist might assign you “homework” where you practice replacing negative thoughts with more positive thoughts.  Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is similar to CBT, but puts a specific emphasis on validation, or accepting uncomfortable thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, instead of fighting them. The theory is that by coming to terms with your harmful thoughts or emotions, you can accept that change is possible and make a recovery plan.  Psychodynamic therapy is a form of talk therapy designed to help you better understand and cope with your day-to-day life. Psychodynamic therapy is based on the idea that your present-day reality is shaped by your unconscious, childhood experiences.  In this form of therapy, your therapist will help you reflect and examine your childhood and experiences to help you understand and cope with your life.

Exposure to doses of white light can help regulate your mood and improve symptoms of depression. Light therapy is commonly used in seasonal affective disorder, which is now called major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern. Talk with a health professional before using light therapy. Those with bipolar disorder can be at risk for mania using light therapy.  Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) uses electrical currents to induce a seizure, and has been shown to help people with clinical depression. It’s used in people with severe depression or depression that is resistant to other treatments or antidepressant medications.  During an ECT procedure, you’ll receive an anesthetic agent which will put you to sleep for approximately 5 to 10 minutes.  Your healthcare professional will place cardiac monitoring pads on your chest and four electrodes on specific areas of your head. They will then deliver short electrical pulses for a few seconds. You will neither convulse nor feel the electrical current and will awaken about 5 to 10 minutes after treatment.  Side effects include headaches, nausea, muscle aches and soreness, and confusion or disorientation.  Patients may also develop memory problems, but these usually reside in the weeks and months after treatment  Ask your doctor about alternative therapies for depression. Many people choose to use alternative therapies alongside traditional psychotherapy and medication. Some examples include: Aim for 30 minutes of physical activity 3 to 5 days a week. Exercise can increase your body’s production of endorphins, which are hormones that improve your mood. Drinking alcohol or misusing substances may make you feel better for a little bit. But in the long run, these substances can make depression and anxiety symptoms worse. Feeling overwhelmed can worsen anxiety and depression symptoms. Setting boundaries in your professional and personal life can help you feel better. You can also improve symptoms of depression by taking care of yourself. This includes getting plenty of sleep, eating a healthy diet, avoiding negative people, and participating in enjoyable activities. Sometimes depression doesn’t respond to medication. Your healthcare professional may recommend other treatment options if your symptoms don’t improve. These options include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat depression and improve your mood. Several types of supplements may have some positive effect on depression symptoms. Take care to discuss any new supplements you may be taking with your healthcare team, as some supplements can have significant side effects or interact with medication. Some research suggests this compound may ease symptoms of depression. The effects were best seen in people taking SSRIs. However, the results of this research is not conclusive and more research is needed. 5-HTP may raise serotonin levels in the brain, which could ease symptoms. Your body makes this chemical when you consume tryptophan, a building block of protein. However, more studies are needed. These essential fats are important to neurological development and brain health. Adding omega-3 supplements to your diet may help reduce depression symptoms. However, there is some conflicting evidence and more research is needed. Always talk to your doctor before taking supplements, as they may interact with other medications or have negative effects.  Vitamins are important to many bodily functions. Research suggests two vitamins are especially useful for easing symptoms of depression: Many herbs, supplements, and vitamins claim to help ease symptoms of depression, but most haven’t shown themselves to be effective in clinical research. Learn about herbs, vitamins, and supplements that have shown some promise, and ask your healthcare professional if any are right for you. There isn’t a single test to diagnose depression. But your healthcare provider can make a diagnosis based on your symptoms and a psychological evaluation. In most cases, they’ll ask a series of questions about your: Because depression can be linked to other health problems, your healthcare professional may also conduct a physical examination and order blood work. Sometimes thyroid problems or a vitamin D deficiency can trigger symptoms of depression. It’s important not to ignore symptoms of depression. If your mood doesn’t improve or gets worse, seek medical help. Depression is a serious mental health illness with the potential for complications. If left untreated, complications can include: Depression can be broken into categories depending on the severity of symptoms. Some people experience mild and temporary episodes, while others experience severe and ongoing depressive episodes. There are two main types: major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the more severe form of depression. It’s characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness that don’t go away on their own. In order to be diagnosed with clinical depression, you must experience five or more of the following symptoms over a 2-week period: There are different subtypes of major depressive disorder, which the American Psychiatric Association refers to as “specifiers.”  These include: Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) used to be called dysthymia. It’s a milder, but chronic, form of depression. In order for the diagnosis to be made, symptoms must last for at least 2 years. PDD can affect your life more than major depression because it lasts for a longer period. It’s common for people with PDD to: Depression can be treated successfully, but it’s important to stick to your treatment plan. Read more about why depression treatment is important. Living with depression can be difficult, but treatment can help improve your quality of life. Talk to your healthcare professional about possible options. The Healthline FindCare tool can provide options in your area if you don’t already have a doctor. Postpartum depression refers to depression that happens after childbirth. It is a common disorder after pregnancy, affecting 1 in 9 new parents.  It’s common for people to experience “baby blues,” or feelings of sadness or emptiness after childbirth. For many people, these symptoms go away in a couple of days. But if you feel sad, hopeless, or empty for longer than 2 weeks post-childbirth, you may have postpartum depression.  Symptoms of postpartum depression can range from mild to severe and can include:  Postpartum depression is thought to be triggered by the dramatic hormonal changes that take place after pregnancy. Bipolar depression occurs in certain types of bipolar disorder when a person experiences a depressive episode. Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder that causes distinct changes in mood, energy, concentration, and the ability to carry out your day-to-day tasks. There are three types of bipolar disorder, all of which include periods known as manic episodes, where you feel extremely “up,” elated, or energized, and depressive episodes where you feel “down,” sad, or hopeless.  If you have bipolar disorder, it can be hard to recognize the harmful effects of each “mood episode.”  People having a depressive episode may:  Symptoms during a depressive episode last every day for most of the day and can last for several days or weeks. If bipolar disorder is treated, many will experience fewer and less severe symptoms of depression, if they experience depressive episodes.  These 7 treatments may help ease symptoms of bipolar depression. Depression and anxiety can occur in a person at the same time. In fact, research has shown that over 70 percent of people with depressive disorders also have symptoms of anxiety. Though they’re thought to be caused by different things, depression and anxiety can produce several similar symptoms, which can include: The two conditions also share some common treatments.  Both anxiety and depression can be treated with: If you think you’re experiencing symptoms of either of these conditions or both of them, make an appointment to talk with your healthcare professional. You can work with them to identify coexisting symptoms of anxiety and depression and how they can be treated. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) causes unwanted and repeated thoughts, urges, and fears (obsessions). These fears cause you to act out repeated behaviors or rituals (compulsions) that you hope will ease the stress caused by the obsessions. People diagnosed with OCD frequently find themselves in a loop of obsessions and compulsions. If you have these behaviors, you may feel isolated because of them. This can lead to withdrawal from friends and social situations, which can increase your risk for depression. It’s not uncommon for someone with OCD to also have depression. Having one anxiety disorder can increase your odds for having another. Up to 80 percent of people with OCD also have depression episodes. This dual diagnosis is a concern with children, too. Their compulsive behaviors, which may be first developing at a young age, can make them feel unusual. That can lead to withdrawing from friends and can increase the chance of a child developing depression. Some individuals who have been diagnosed with major depression may also have symptoms of another mental disorder called psychosis. When the two conditions occur together, it’s known as “major depressive disorder, severe with psychotic features,” or depressive psychosis. Depressive psychosis causes people to see, hear, believe, or smell things that aren’t real. People with the condition may also experience feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and irritability. The combination of the two conditions is particularly dangerous. That’s because someone with depressive psychosis may experience delusions that cause them to have thoughts of suicide or to take unusual risks. It’s unclear what causes these two conditions or why they can occur together, but treatment can successfully ease symptoms. Treatments include medications and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Understanding the risk factors and possible causes can help you be aware of early symptoms. Read more about depressive psychosis, how it’s treated, and what healthcare professionals understand about why it occurs. Pregnancy is often an exciting time for people. However, it can still be common for a pregnant woman to experience depression. Symptoms of depression during pregnancy include: Treatment for depression during pregnancy may focus entirely on talk therapy and other natural treatments. While some women do take antidepressants during their pregnancy, it’s not clear which ones are the safest. Your healthcare provider may encourage you to try an alternative option until after the birth of your baby. The risks for depression can continue after the baby arrives. Postpartum depression, which is also called major depressive disorder with peripartum onset, is a serious concern for new mothers. Recognizing the symptoms may help you spot a problem and seek help before it becomes overwhelming. Research has established a link between alcohol use and depression. People who have depression are more likely to misuse alcohol. Out of the 20.2 million U.S. adults who experienced a substance use disorder, about 50 percent had a co-occurring mental illness. Drinking alcohol frequently can make symptoms of depression worse, and people who have depression are more likely to misuse alcohol or become dependent on it. Depression isn’t generally considered to be preventable. It’s hard to recognize what causes it, which means preventing it is more difficult. But once you’ve experienced a depressive episode, you may be better prepared to prevent a future episode by learning which lifestyle changes and treatments are helpful.  Techniques that may help include: Other techniques and ideas may also help you prevent depression. Read the full list of 15 ways you may be able to avoid depression. Depression can be temporary, or it can be a long-term challenge. Treatment doesn’t always make your depression go away completely. However, treatment often makes symptoms more manageable. Managing symptoms of depression involves finding the right combination of medications and therapies.  If one treatment doesn’t work, talk with your healthcare professional. They can help you create a different treatment plan that may work better in helping you manage your condition.  Read this article in Spanish.

 Depression is a mental state of low mood and aversion to activity.[3] It affects more than 280 million people of all ages (about 3.5% of the global population).[4] Depression affects a person's thoughts, behavior, feelings, and sense of well-being.[5] Depressed people often experience loss of motivation or interest in, or reduced pleasure or joy from, experiences that would normally bring them pleasure or joy.[6]
 Depressed mood is a symptom of some mood disorders such as major depressive disorder and dysthymia;[7] it is a normal temporary reaction to life events, such as the loss of a loved one; and it is also a symptom of some physical diseases and a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments.
It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection or hopelessness and may experience suicidal thoughts. It can either be short term or long term.
 Adversity in childhood, such as bereavement, neglect, mental abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, or unequal parental treatment of siblings can contribute to depression in adulthood.[8][9] Childhood physical or sexual abuse in particular significantly correlates with the likelihood of experiencing depression over the survivor's lifetime.[10] People who have experienced four or more adverse childhood experiences are 3.2 to 4.0 times more likely to suffer from depression.[11] Poor housing quality, non-functionality, lack of green spaces, and exposure to noise and air pollution are linked to depressive moods, emphasizing the need for consideration in planning to prevent such outcomes.[12] Locality has also been linked to depression and other negative moods. The rate of depression among those who reside in large urban areas is shown to be lower than those who do not.[13] Likewise, those from smaller towns and rural areas tend to have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and psychological unwellness.[14]
 Studies have consistently shown that physicians have had the highest depression and suicide rates compared to people in many other lines of work—for suicide, 40% higher for male physicians and 130% higher for female physicians.[15][16][17]
 Life events and changes that may cause depressed mood include (but are not limited to): childbirth, menopause, financial difficulties, unemployment, stress (such as from work, education, military service, family, living conditions, marriage, etc.), a medical diagnosis (cancer, HIV, diabetes, etc.), bullying, loss of a loved one, natural disasters, social isolation, rape, relationship troubles, jealousy, separation, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, or catastrophic injury.[18][19][20][21][22] Similar depressive symptoms are associated with survivor's guilt.[23] Adolescents may be especially prone to experiencing a depressed mood following social rejection, peer pressure, or bullying.[24]
 Depression in childhood and adolescence is similar to adult major depressive disorder, although young sufferers may exhibit increased irritability or behavioral dyscontrol instead of the more common sad, empty, or hopeless feelings seen with adults.[25] Children who are under stress, experiencing loss, or have other underlying disorders are at a higher risk for depression. Childhood depression is often comorbid with mental disorders outside of other mood disorders; most commonly anxiety disorder and conduct disorder. Depression also tends to run in families.[26]
 Depression is associated with low extraversion,[27] and people who have high levels of neuroticism are more likely to experience depressive symptoms and are more likely to receive a diagnosis of a depressive disorder.[28] Additionally, depression is associated with low conscientiousness. Some factors that may arise from low conscientiousness include disorganization and dissatisfaction with life. Individuals may be more exposed to stress and depression as a result of these factors.[29]
 It is possible that some early-generation beta-blockers induce depression in some patients, though the evidence for this is weak and conflicting. There is strong evidence for a link between alpha interferon therapy and depression. One study found that a third of alpha interferon-treated patients had developed depression after three months of treatment. (Beta interferon therapy appears to have no effect on rates of depression.) There is moderately strong evidence that finasteride when used in the treatment of alopecia increases depressive symptoms in some patients. Evidence linking isotretinoin, an acne treatment, to depression is strong.[30] Other medicines that seem to increase the risk of depression include anticonvulsants, antimigraine drugs, antipsychotics and hormonal agents such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist.[31]
 Several drugs of abuse can cause or exacerbate depression, whether in intoxication, withdrawal, and from chronic use. These include alcohol, sedatives (including prescription benzodiazepines), opioids (including prescription pain killers and illicit drugs such as heroin), stimulants (such as cocaine and amphetamines), hallucinogens, and inhalants.[32]
 Depressed mood can be the result of a number of infectious diseases, nutritional deficiencies, neurological conditions, and physiological problems, including hypoandrogenism (in men), Addison's disease, Cushing's syndrome, pernicious anemia, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease,[33] chronic pain, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and HIV.[34][35][36]
 Studies have found that anywhere from 30 to 85 percent of patients suffering from chronic pain are also clinically depressed.[37][38][39] A 2014 study by Hooley et al. concluded that chronic pain increased the chance of death by suicide by two to three times.[40] In 2017, the British Medical Association found that 49% of UK chronic pain patients also had depression.[41]
 A number of psychiatric syndromes feature depressed mood as a main symptom. The mood disorders are a group of disorders considered to be primary disturbances of mood. These include major depressive disorder (commonly called major depression or clinical depression) where a person has at least two weeks of depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities; and dysthymia, a state of chronic depressed mood, the symptoms of which do not meet the severity of a major depressive episode. Another mood disorder, bipolar disorder, features one or more episodes of abnormally elevated mood, cognition, and energy levels, but may also involve one or more episodes of depression.[42] Individuals with bipolar depression are often misdiagnosed with unipolar depression.[43] When the course of depressive episodes follows a seasonal pattern, the disorder (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, etc.) may be described as a seasonal affective disorder.
 Outside the mood disorders: borderline personality disorder often features an extremely intense depressive mood; adjustment disorder with depressed mood is a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode;[44] and posttraumatic stress disorder, a mental disorder that sometimes follows trauma, is commonly accompanied by depressed mood.[45]
 There is evidence for a link between inflammation and depression.[46] Inflammatory processes can be triggered by negative cognitions or their consequences, such as stress, violence, or deprivation. Thus, negative cognitions can cause inflammation that can, in turn, lead to depression.[47][48][dubious – discuss]
In addition, there is increasing evidence that inflammation can cause depression because of the increase of cytokines, setting the brain into a ""sickness mode"".[49]
 Classical symptoms of being physically sick, such as lethargy, show a large overlap in behaviors that characterize depression. Levels of cytokines tend to increase sharply during the depressive episodes of people with bipolar disorder and drop off during remission.[50] Furthermore, it has been shown in clinical trials that anti-inflammatory medicines taken in addition to antidepressants not only significantly improves symptoms but also increases the proportion of subjects positively responding to treatment.[51]
 Researchers have begun to conceptualize ways in which the historical legacies of racism and colonialism may create depressive conditions.[53][54] Given the lived experiences of marginalized peoples, ranging from conditions of migration, class stratification, cultural genocide, labor exploitation, and social immobility, depression can be seen as a ""rational response to global conditions"", according to Ann Cvetkovich.[55]
 Psychogeographical depression overlaps somewhat with the theory of ""deprejudice"", a portmanteau of depression and prejudice proposed by Cox, Abramson, Devine, and Hollon in 2012,[54] who argue for an integrative approach to studying the often comorbid experiences. Cox, Abramson, Devine, and Hollon are concerned with the ways in which social stereotypes are often internalized, creating negative self-stereotypes that then produce depressive symptoms.
 Unlike the theory of ""deprejudice"", a psychogeographical theory of depression attempts to broaden study of the subject beyond an individual experience to one produced on a societal scale, seeing particular manifestations of depression as rooted in dispossession; historical legacies of genocide, slavery, and colonialism are productive of segregation, both material and psychic material deprivation,[56] and concomitant circumstances of violence, systemic exclusion, and lack of access to legal protections. The demands of navigating these circumstances compromise the resources available to a population to seek comfort, health, stability, and sense of security. The historical memory of this trauma conditions the psychological health of future generations, making psychogeographical depression an intergenerational experience as well. 
 This work is supported by recent studies in genetic science which has demonstrated an epigenetic link between the trauma suffered by Holocaust survivors and the genetic reverberations for subsequent generations.[57][non-primary source needed] Likewise, research by scientists at Emory University suggests that memories of trauma can be inherited, rendering offspring vulnerable to psychological predispositions for stress disorders, schizophrenia, and PTSD.[58]
 Measures of depression include, but are not limited to: Beck Depression Inventory-11 and the 9-item depression scale in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).[59] Both of these measures are psychological tests that ask personal questions of the participant, and have mostly been used to measure the severity of depression. The Beck Depression Inventory is a self-report scale that helps a therapist identify the patterns of depression symptoms and monitor recovery. The responses on this scale can be discussed in therapy to devise interventions for the most distressing symptoms of depression.[6]
 Schools of depression theories include:
 Depressed mood may not require professional treatment, and may be a normal temporary reaction to life events, a symptom of some medical condition, or a side effect of some drugs or medical treatments. A prolonged depressed mood, especially in combination with other symptoms, may lead to a diagnosis of a psychiatric or medical condition which may benefit from treatment. Many have linked depression to a life falling short of expectations and have blamed influencers for setting unrealistic expectations.[60][61][62]
 The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2009 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor.[63]
 Physical activity has a protective effect against the emergence of depression in some people.[64]
 There is limited evidence suggesting yoga may help some people with depressive disorders or elevated levels of depression, but more research is needed.[65][66]
 Reminiscence of old and fond memories is another alternative form of treatment, especially for the elderly who have lived longer and have more experiences in life.[67] It is a method that causes a person to recollect memories of their own life, leading to a process of self-recognition and identifying familiar stimuli. By maintaining one's personal past and identity, it is a technique that stimulates people to view their lives in a more objective and balanced way, causing them to pay attention to positive information in their life stories, which would successfully reduce depressive mood levels.[68]
 There is limited evidence that continuing antidepressant medication for one year reduces the risk of depression recurrence with no additional harm.[69] Recommendations for psychological treatments or combination treatments in preventing recurrence are not clear.[69]
 Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, the United Nations (UN) health agency reported, estimating that it affects more than 300 million people worldwide – the majority of them women, young people and the elderly. An estimated 4.4 percent of the global population has depression, according to a report released by the UN World Health Organization (WHO), which shows an 18 percent increase in the number of people living with depression between 2005 and 2015.[70][71][72]
 Depression is a major mental-health cause of disease burden. Its consequences further lead to significant burden in public health, including a higher risk of dementia, premature mortality arising from physical disorders, and maternal depression impacts on child growth and development.[73] Approximately 76% to 85% of depressed people in low- and middle-income countries do not receive treatment;[74] barriers to treatment include: inaccurate assessment, lack of trained health-care providers, social stigma and lack of resources.[4]
 The stigma comes from misguided societal views that people with mental illness are different from everyone else, and they can choose to get better only if they wanted to.[75] Due to this more than half of the people with depression do not receive help with their disorders. The stigma leads to a strong preference for privacy. An analysis of 40,350 undergraduates from 70 institutions by Posselt and Lipson found that undergraduates who perceived their classroom environments as highly competitive had a 37% higher chance of developing depression and a 69% higher chance of developing anxiety.[76] Several studies have suggested that unemployment roughly doubles the risk of developing depression.[77][78][79][80][81]
 The World Health Organization has constructed guidelines – known as The Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) – aiming to increase services for people with mental, neurological and substance-use disorders.[4] Depression is listed as one of conditions prioritized by the programme. Trials conducted show possibilities for the implementation of the programme in low-resource primary-care settings dependent on primary-care practitioners and lay health-workers.[82]
Examples of mhGAP-endorsed therapies targeting depression include Group Interpersonal Therapy as group treatment for depression and ""Thinking Health"", which utilizes cognitive behavioral therapy to tackle perinatal depression.[4] Furthermore, effective screening in primary care is crucial for the access of treatments. The mhGAP adopted its approach of improving detection rates of depression by training general practitioners. However, there is still weak evidence supporting this training.[73]
 According to 2011 study, people who are high in hypercompetitive traits are also likely to measure higher for depression and anxiety.[83]
 The term depression was derived from the Latin verb deprimere, ""to press down"".[84] From the 14th century, ""to depress"" meant to subjugate or to bring down in spirits. It was used in 1665 in English author Richard Baker's Chronicle to refer to someone having ""a great depression of spirit"", and by English author Samuel Johnson in a similar sense in 1753.[85]
 In Ancient Greece, disease was thought due to an imbalance in the four basic bodily fluids, or humors. Personality types were similarly thought to be determined by the dominant humor in a particular person. Derived from the Ancient Greek melas, ""black"", and kholé, ""bile"",[86] melancholia was described as a distinct disease with particular mental and physical symptoms by Hippocrates in his Aphorisms, where he characterized all ""fears and despondencies, if they last a long time"" as being symptomatic of the ailment.[87]
 During the 18th century, the humoral theory of melancholia was increasingly being challenged by mechanical and electrical explanations; references to dark and gloomy states gave way to ideas of slowed circulation and depleted energy.[88] German physician Johann Christian Heinroth, however, argued melancholia was a disturbance of the soul due to moral conflict within the patient.
 In the 20th century, the German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin distinguished manic depression. The influential system put forward by Kraepelin unified nearly all types of mood disorder into manic–depressive insanity. Kraepelin worked from an assumption of underlying brain pathology, but also promoted a distinction between endogenous (internally caused) and exogenous (externally caused) types.[89]
 Other psycho-dynamic theories were proposed. Existential and humanistic theories represented a forceful affirmation of individualism.[90] Austrian existential psychiatrist Viktor Frankl connected depression to feelings of futility and meaninglessness.[91] Frankl's logotherapy addressed the filling of an ""existential vacuum"" associated with such feelings, and may be particularly useful for depressed adolescents.[92][93]
 Researchers theorized that depression was caused by a chemical imbalance in neurotransmitters in the brain, a theory based on observations made in the 1950s of the effects of reserpine and isoniazid in altering monoamine neurotransmitter levels and affecting depressive symptoms.[94] During the 1960s and 70s, manic-depression came to refer to just one type of mood disorder (now most commonly known as bipolar disorder) which was distinguished from (unipolar) depression. The terms unipolar and bipolar had been coined by German psychiatrist Karl Kleist.[89]
 In July 2022, British psychiatrist Joanna Moncrieff, also psychiatrist Mark Horowtiz and others proposed in a study on academic journal Molecular Psychiatry that depression is not caused by a serotonin imbalance in the human body, unlike what most of the psychiatry community points to, and that therefore anti-depressants do not work against the illness.[95][96] However, such study was met with criticism from some psychiatrists, who argued the study's methodology used an indirect trace of serotonin, instead of taking direct measurements of the molecule.[97] Moncrieff said that, despite her study's conclusions, no one should interrupt their treatment if they are taking any anti-depressant.[97]

 Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high. There are 2 main types of diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. In the UK, over 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2. High blood sugar that develops during pregnancy is known as gestational diabetes. It usually goes away after giving birth. Many people have blood sugar levels above the normal range, but not high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes. This is known as non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, or pre-diabetes. People with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but the risk can be reduced through lifestyle changes. If you have non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, you may be eligible for the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme. The programme helps people make lasting lifestyle changes and has been shown to help prevent type 2 diabetes. People with non-diabetic hyperglycaemia are also recommended to have a blood test every year to monitor their blood sugar levels. It's very important for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible because it's likely to get worse if left untreated and can cause long-term health problems. Visit your GP as soon as possible if you experience the main symptoms of diabetes, which include: Type 1 diabetes can develop quickly over weeks or even days. Weight loss is common in people with type 1 diabetes when it first develops and before it's treated, but it's less common in people with type 2 diabetes. Many people have type 2 diabetes for years without realising because the early symptoms tend to be general, or there are no symptoms at all. The amount of sugar in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach). When food is digested and enters your bloodstream, insulin moves glucose out of the blood and into cells, where it's broken down to produce energy. However, if you have diabetes, your body is unable to break down glucose into energy. This is because there's either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or the insulin produced does not work properly. There are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of type 1 diabetes. You can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes through healthy eating, regular exercise and achieving a healthy body weight. You may be more at risk of type 2 diabetes if you: If you're diagnosed with diabetes, you'll need to eat healthily, take regular exercise and have regular checks including blood tests. You can use the BMI healthy weight calculator to check whether you're a healthy weight. Try to quit smoking if you smoke, and cut down on alcohol. People diagnosed with type 1 diabetes also require regular insulin injections for the rest of their life. Type 2 diabetes can get worse over time and people living with type 2 diabetes often need medicine, usually in the form of tablets or injections. However, some people can put their type 2 diabetes into remission by losing weight, where their blood sugar is reduced below the diabetes range. Some people are able to do this through a low-calorie diet, but this is not suitable for everyone, so it's important to get medical advice first. Read about:  Everyone with diabetes aged 12 years old or over should be invited to have their eyes screened regularly. If you have diabetes, your eyes are at risk from diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to sight loss if it's not treated. Screening, which includes a 30-minute check to examine the back of the eyes, is a way of diagnosing diabetic retinopathy and detecting the condition early where possible so it can be treated more effectively. In many people, this can stop it affecting their vision or reduce the chance of it getting worse. It's important to see a doctor if you notice any problems with your eyesight. Do not wait for your next screening appointment. Read more about diabetic eye screening. Diabetes can damage the nerves in your feet and cause a loss of feeling. It can also reduce the blood supply to your feet. This means you may not notice if your foot is sore or injured, and foot injuries do not heal as well. This can lead to ulcers and infections, and sometimes amputations can be needed in serious cases. Adults with diabetes should have their feet checked every year by a healthcare professional. It's important to see a healthcare professional as soon as possible if you notice any problems with your feet. You can read more about diabetes and foot problems on the Diabetes UK website.

 Diabetes mellitus, often known simply as diabetes, is a group of common endocrine diseases characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels.[10][11] Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough insulin, or the cells of the body becoming unresponsive to the hormone's effects.[12] Classic symptoms include thirst, polyuria, weight loss, and blurred vision. If left untreated, the disease can lead to various health complications, including disorders of the cardiovascular system, eye, kidney, and nerves.[3] Diabetes accounts for approximately 4.2 million deaths every year,[9] with an estimated 1.5 million caused by either untreated or poorly treated diabetes.[10]
 The major types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2.[13] The most common treatment for type 1 is insulin replacement therapy (insulin injections), while anti-diabetic medications (such as metformin and semaglutide) and lifestyle modifications can be used to manage type 2. Gestational diabetes, a form that arises during pregnancy in some women, normally resolves shortly after delivery.
 As of 2021, an estimated 537 million people had diabetes worldwide accounting for 10.5% of the adult population, with type 2 making up about 90% of all cases. It is estimated that by 2045, approximately 783 million adults, or 1 in 8, will be living with diabetes, representing a 46% increase from the current figures.[14] The prevalence of the disease continues to increase, most dramatically in low- and middle-income nations.[15] Rates are similar in women and men, with diabetes being the seventh leading cause of death globally.[16][17] The global expenditure on diabetes-related healthcare is an estimated US$760 billion a year.[18]
 The classic symptoms of untreated diabetes are polyuria, thirst, and weight loss.[19] Several other non-specific signs and symptoms may also occur, including fatigue, blurred vision, and genital itchiness due to Candida infection.[19] About half of affected individuals may also be asymptomatic.[19] Type 1 presents abruptly following a pre-clinical phase, while type 2 has a more insidious onset; patients may remain asymptomatic for many years.[20]
 Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency that occurs most commonly in type 1, but may also occur in type 2 if it has been longstanding or if the individual has significant β-cell dysfunction.[21] Excessive production of ketone bodies leads to signs and symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, the smell of acetone in the breath, deep breathing known as Kussmaul breathing, and in severe cases decreased level of consciousness.[21] Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is another emergency characterized by dehydration secondary to severe hyperglycemia, with resultant hypernatremia leading to an altered mental state and possibly coma.[22]
 Hypoglycemia is a recognized complication of insulin treatment used in diabetes.[23] An acute presentation can include mild symptoms such as sweating, trembling, and palpitations, to more serious effects including impaired cognition, confusion, seizures, coma, and rarely death.[23] Recurrent hypoglycemic episodes may lower the glycemic threshold at which symptoms occur, meaning mild symptoms may not appear before cognitive deterioration begins to occur.[23]
 The major long-term complications of diabetes relate to damage to blood vessels at both macrovascular and microvascular levels.[24][25] Diabetes doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease, and about 75% of deaths in people with diabetes are due to coronary artery disease.[26] Other macrovascular morbidities include stroke and peripheral artery disease.[27]
 Microvascular disease affects the eyes, kidneys, and nerves.[24] Damage to the retina, known as diabetic retinopathy, is the most common cause of blindness in people of working age.[19] The eyes can also be affected in other ways, including development of cataract and glaucoma.[19] It is recommended that people with diabetes visit an optometrist or ophthalmologist once a year.[28]
 Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause of chronic kidney disease, accounting for over 50% of patients on dialysis in the United States.[29] Diabetic neuropathy, damage to nerves, manifests in various ways, including sensory loss, neuropathic pain, and autonomic dysfunction (such as postural hypotension, diarrhoea, and erectile dysfunction).[19] Loss of pain sensation predisposes to trauma that can lead to diabetic foot problems (such as ulceration), the most common cause of non-traumatic lower-limb amputation.[19]
 Hearing loss is another long term complication associated with diabetes.[30]
 Based on extensive data and numerous cases of gallstone disease, it appears that a causal link might exist between type 2 diabetes and gallstones. People with diabetes are at a higher risk of developing gallstones compared to those without diabetes.[31]
 There is a link between cognitive deficit and diabetes; studies have shown that diabetic individuals are at a greater risk of cognitive decline, and have a greater rate of decline compared to those without the disease.[32] The condition also predisposes to falls in the elderly, especially those treated with insulin.[33]
 (age standardized)
 Diabetes is classified by the World Health Organization into six categories: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, hybrid forms of diabetes (including slowly evolving, immune-mediated diabetes of adults and ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes), hyperglycemia first detected during pregnancy, ""other specific types"", and ""unclassified diabetes"".[43] Diabetes is a more variable disease than once thought, and individuals may have a combination of forms.[44]
 
Type 1 accounts for 5 to 10% of diabetes cases and is the most common type diagnosed in patients under 20 years;[45] however, the older term ""juvenile-onset diabetes"" is no longer used as onset in adulthood is not unusual.[29] The disease is characterized by loss of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreatic islets, leading to severe insulin deficiency, and can be further classified as immune-mediated or idiopathic (without known cause).[45] The majority of cases are immune-mediated, in which a T cell-mediated autoimmune attack causes loss of beta cells and thus insulin deficiency.[46] Patients often have irregular and unpredictable blood sugar levels due to very low insulin and an impaired counter-response to hypoglycemia.[47]  Type 1 diabetes is partly inherited, with multiple genes, including certain HLA genotypes, known to influence the risk of diabetes. In genetically susceptible people, the onset of diabetes can be triggered by one or more environmental factors,[48] such as a viral infection or diet. Several viruses have been implicated, but to date there is no stringent evidence to support this hypothesis in humans.[48][49]
 Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, and a significant proportion is diagnosed during adulthood. Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is the diagnostic term applied when type 1 diabetes develops in adults; it has a slower onset than the same condition in children. Given this difference, some use the unofficial term ""type 1.5 diabetes"" for this condition. Adults with LADA are frequently initially misdiagnosed as having type 2 diabetes, based on age rather than a cause.[50] LADA leaves adults with higher levels of insulin production than type 1 diabetes, but not enough insulin production for healthy blood sugar levels.[51][52]
 Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, which may be combined with relatively reduced insulin secretion.[12] The defective responsiveness of body tissues to insulin is believed to involve the insulin receptor.[53] However, the specific defects are not known. Diabetes mellitus cases due to a known defect are classified separately. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes mellitus accounting for 95% of diabetes.[2] Many people with type 2 diabetes have evidence of prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) before meeting the criteria for type 2 diabetes.[54] The progression of prediabetes to overt type 2 diabetes can be slowed or reversed by lifestyle changes or medications that improve insulin sensitivity or reduce the liver's glucose production.[55]
 Type 2 diabetes is primarily due to lifestyle factors and genetics.[56] A number of lifestyle factors are known to be important to the development of type 2 diabetes, including obesity (defined by a body mass index of greater than 30), lack of physical activity, poor diet, stress, and urbanization.[34][57] Excess body fat is associated with 30% of cases in people of Chinese and Japanese descent, 60–80% of cases in those of European and African descent, and 100% of Pima Indians and Pacific Islanders.[12] Even those who are not obese may have a high waist–hip ratio.[12]
 Dietary factors such as sugar-sweetened drinks are associated with an increased risk.[58][59] The type of fats in the diet is also important, with saturated fat and trans fats increasing the risk and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat decreasing the risk.[56] Eating white rice excessively may increase the risk of diabetes, especially in Chinese and Japanese people.[60] Lack of physical activity may increase the risk of diabetes in some people.[61]
 Adverse childhood experiences, including abuse, neglect, and household difficulties, increase the likelihood of type 2 diabetes later in life by 32%, with neglect having the strongest effect.[62]
 Antipsychotic medication side effects (specifically metabolic abnormalities, dyslipidemia and weight gain) are also potential risk factors.[63]
 Gestational diabetes resembles type 2 diabetes in several respects, involving a combination of relatively inadequate insulin secretion and responsiveness. It occurs in about 2–10% of all pregnancies and may improve or disappear after delivery.[64] It is recommended that all pregnant women get tested starting around 24–28 weeks gestation.[65] It is most often diagnosed in the second or third trimester because of the increase in insulin-antagonist hormone levels that occurs at this time.[65] However, after pregnancy approximately 5–10% of women with gestational diabetes are found to have another form of diabetes, most commonly type 2.[64] Gestational diabetes is fully treatable, but requires careful medical supervision throughout the pregnancy. Management may include dietary changes, blood glucose monitoring, and in some cases, insulin may be required.[66]
 Though it may be transient, untreated gestational diabetes can damage the health of the fetus or mother. Risks to the baby include macrosomia (high birth weight), congenital heart and central nervous system abnormalities, and skeletal muscle malformations. Increased levels of insulin in a fetus's blood may inhibit fetal surfactant production and cause infant respiratory distress syndrome. A high blood bilirubin level may result from red blood cell destruction. In severe cases, perinatal death may occur, most commonly as a result of poor placental perfusion due to vascular impairment. Labor induction may be indicated with decreased placental function. A caesarean section may be performed if there is marked fetal distress[67] or an increased risk of injury associated with macrosomia, such as shoulder dystocia.[68]
 Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited form of diabetes, due to one of several single-gene mutations causing defects in insulin production.[69] It is significantly less common than the three main types, constituting 1–2% of all cases. The name of this disease refers to early hypotheses as to its nature. Being due to a defective gene, this disease varies in age at presentation and in severity according to the specific gene defect; thus, there are at least 13 subtypes of MODY. People with MODY often can control it without using insulin.[70]
 Some cases of diabetes are caused by the body's tissue receptors not responding to insulin (even when insulin levels are normal, which is what separates it from type 2 diabetes); this form is very uncommon. Genetic mutations (autosomal or mitochondrial) can lead to defects in beta cell function. Abnormal insulin action may also have been genetically determined in some cases. Any disease that causes extensive damage to the pancreas may lead to diabetes (for example, chronic pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis). Diseases associated with excessive secretion of insulin-antagonistic hormones can cause diabetes (which is typically resolved once the hormone excess is removed). Many drugs impair insulin secretion and some toxins damage pancreatic beta cells, whereas others increase insulin resistance (especially glucocorticoids which can provoke ""steroid diabetes""). The ICD-10 (1992) diagnostic entity, malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus (ICD-10 code E12), was deprecated by the World Health Organization (WHO) when the current taxonomy was introduced in 1999.[71]
Yet another form of diabetes that people may develop is double diabetes. This is when a type 1 diabetic becomes insulin resistant, the hallmark for type 2 diabetes or has a family history for type 2 diabetes.[72] It was first discovered in 1990 or 1991.
 The following is a list of disorders that may increase the risk of diabetes:[73]
 Insulin is the principal hormone that regulates the uptake of glucose from the blood into most cells of the body, especially liver, adipose tissue and muscle, except smooth muscle, in which insulin acts via the IGF-1.[75] Therefore, deficiency of insulin or the insensitivity of its receptors play a central role in all forms of diabetes mellitus.[76]
 The body obtains glucose from three main sources: the intestinal absorption of food; the breakdown of glycogen (glycogenolysis), the storage form of glucose found in the liver; and gluconeogenesis, the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate substrates in the body.[77] Insulin plays a critical role in regulating glucose levels in the body. Insulin can inhibit the breakdown of glycogen or the process of gluconeogenesis, it can stimulate the transport of glucose into fat and muscle cells, and it can stimulate the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen.[77]
 Insulin is released into the blood by beta cells (β-cells), found in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, in response to rising levels of blood glucose, typically after eating. Insulin is used by about two-thirds of the body's cells to absorb glucose from the blood for use as fuel, for conversion to other needed molecules, or for storage. Lower glucose levels result in decreased insulin release from the beta cells and in the breakdown of glycogen to glucose. This process is mainly controlled by the hormone glucagon, which acts in the opposite manner to insulin.[78]
 If the amount of insulin available is insufficient, or if cells respond poorly to the effects of insulin (insulin resistance), or if the insulin itself is defective, then glucose is not absorbed properly by the body cells that require it, and is not stored appropriately in the liver and muscles. The net effect is persistently high levels of blood glucose, poor protein synthesis, and other metabolic derangements, such as metabolic acidosis in cases of complete insulin deficiency.[77]
 When there is too much glucose in the blood for a long time, the kidneys cannot absorb it all (reach a threshold of reabsorption) and the extra glucose gets passed out of the body through urine (glycosuria).[79] This increases the osmotic pressure of the urine and inhibits reabsorption of water by the kidney, resulting in increased urine production (polyuria) and increased fluid loss. Lost blood volume is replaced osmotically from water in body cells and other body compartments, causing dehydration and increased thirst (polydipsia).[77] In addition, intracellular glucose deficiency stimulates appetite leading to excessive food intake (polyphagia).[80]
 Diabetes mellitus is diagnosed with a test for the glucose content in the blood, and is diagnosed by demonstrating any one of the following:[71]
 A positive result, in the absence of unequivocal high blood sugar, should be confirmed by a repeat of any of the above methods on a different day. It is preferable to measure a fasting glucose level because of the ease of measurement and the considerable time commitment of formal glucose tolerance testing, which takes two hours to complete and offers no prognostic advantage over the fasting test.[84] According to the current definition, two fasting glucose measurements at or above 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) is considered diagnostic for diabetes mellitus.
 Per the WHO, people with fasting glucose levels from 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L (110 to 125 mg/dL) are considered to have impaired fasting glucose.[85] People with plasma glucose at or above 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL), but not over 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), two hours after a 75 gram oral glucose load are considered to have impaired glucose tolerance. Of these two prediabetic states, the latter in particular is a major risk factor for progression to full-blown diabetes mellitus, as well as cardiovascular disease.[86] The American Diabetes Association (ADA) since 2003 uses a slightly different range for impaired fasting glucose of 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L (100 to 125 mg/dL).[87]
 Glycated hemoglobin is better than fasting glucose for determining risks of cardiovascular disease and death from any cause.[88]
 There is no known preventive measure for type 1 diabetes.[2] However, islet autoimmunity and multiple antibodies can be a strong predictor of the onset of type 1 diabetes.[89]  Type 2 diabetes—which accounts for 85–90% of all cases worldwide—can often be prevented or delayed[90] by maintaining a normal body weight, engaging in physical activity, and eating a healthy diet.[2] Higher levels of physical activity (more than 90 minutes per day) reduce the risk of diabetes by 28%.[91] Dietary changes known to be effective in helping to prevent diabetes include maintaining a diet rich in whole grains and fiber, and choosing good fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish.[92] Limiting sugary beverages and eating less red meat and other sources of saturated fat can also help prevent diabetes.[92] Tobacco smoking is also associated with an increased risk of diabetes and its complications, so smoking cessation can be an important preventive measure as well.[93]
 The relationship between type 2 diabetes and the main modifiable risk factors (excess weight, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and tobacco use) is similar in all regions of the world. There is growing evidence that the underlying determinants of diabetes are a reflection of the major forces driving social, economic and cultural change: globalization, urbanization, population aging, and the general health policy environment.[94]
 Diabetes patients' comorbidities have a significant impact on medical expenses and related costs. It has been demonstrated that patients with diabetes are more likely to experience respiratory, urinary tract, and skin infections, develop atherosclerosis, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, putting them at increased risk of infection and complications that require medical attention.[95] Patients with diabetes mellitus are more likely to experience certain infections, such as COVID-19, with prevalence rates ranging from 5.3 to 35.5%.[96][97] Maintaining adequate glycemic control is the primary goal of diabetes management since it is critical to managing diabetes and preventing or postponing such complications.[98]
 Diabetes management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels close to normal, without causing low blood sugar.[99] This can usually be accomplished with dietary changes,[100] exercise, weight loss, and use of appropriate medications (insulin, oral medications).[99]
 Learning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is important, since complications are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.[99][101] The goal of treatment is an A1C level below 7%.[102][103] Attention is also paid to other health problems that may accelerate the negative effects of diabetes. These include smoking, high blood pressure, metabolic syndrome obesity, and lack of regular exercise.[99][104] Specialized footwear is widely used to reduce the risk of diabetic foot ulcers by relieving the pressure on the foot.[105][106][107] Foot examination for patients living with diabetes should be done annually which includes sensation testing, foot biomechanics, vascular integrity and foot structure.[108]
 Concerning those with severe mental illness, the efficacy of type 2 diabetes self-management interventions is still poorly explored, with insufficient scientific evidence to show whether these interventions have similar results to those observed in the general population.[109]
 People with diabetes can benefit from education about the disease and treatment, dietary changes, and exercise, with the goal of keeping both short-term and long-term blood glucose levels within acceptable bounds. In addition, given the associated higher risks of cardiovascular disease, lifestyle modifications are recommended to control blood pressure.[110][111]
 Weight loss can prevent progression from prediabetes to diabetes type 2, decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, or result in a partial remission in people with diabetes.[112][113] No single dietary pattern is best for all people with diabetes.[114] Healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, low-carbohydrate diet, or DASH diet, are often recommended, although evidence does not support one over the others.[112][113] According to the ADA, ""reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia"", and for individuals with type 2 diabetes who cannot meet the glycemic targets or where reducing anti-glycemic medications is a priority, low or very-low carbohydrate diets are a viable approach.[113] For overweight people with type 2 diabetes, any diet that achieves weight loss is effective.[114][115]
 A 2020 Cochrane systematic review compared several non-nutritive sweeteners to sugar, placebo and a nutritive low-calorie sweetener (tagatose), but the results were unclear for effects on HbA1c, body weight and adverse events.[116] The studies included were mainly of very low-certainty and did not report on health-related quality of life, diabetes complications, all-cause mortality or socioeconomic effects.[116]
 Most medications used to treat diabetes act by lowering blood sugar levels through different mechanisms. There is broad consensus that when people with diabetes maintain tight glucose control – keeping the glucose levels in their blood within normal ranges – they experience fewer complications, such as kidney problems or eye problems.[117][118] There is however debate as to whether this is appropriate and cost effective for people later in life in whom the risk of hypoglycemia may be more significant.[119]
 There are a number of different classes of anti-diabetic medications. Type 1 diabetes requires treatment with insulin, ideally using a ""basal bolus"" regimen that most closely matches normal insulin release: long-acting insulin for the basal rate and short-acting insulin with meals.[120] Type 2 diabetes is generally treated with medication that is taken by mouth (e.g. metformin) although some eventually require injectable treatment with insulin or GLP-1 agonists.[121]
 Metformin is generally recommended as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, as there is good evidence that it decreases mortality.[7] It works by decreasing the liver's production of glucose, and increasing the amount of glucose stored in peripheral tissue.[122] Several other groups of drugs, mainly oral medication, may also decrease blood sugar in type 2 diabetes. These include agents that increase insulin release (sulfonylureas), agents that decrease absorption of sugar from the intestines (acarbose), agents that inhibit the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) that inactivates incretins such as GLP-1 and GIP (sitagliptin), agents that make the body more sensitive to insulin (thiazolidinedione) and agents that increase the excretion of glucose in the urine (SGLT2 inhibitors).[122] When insulin is used in type 2 diabetes, a long-acting formulation is usually added initially, while continuing oral medications.[7]
 Some severe cases of type 2 diabetes may also be treated with insulin, which is increased gradually until glucose targets are reached.[7][123]
 Cardiovascular disease is a serious complication associated with diabetes, and many international guidelines recommend blood pressure treatment targets that are lower than 140/90 mmHg for people with diabetes.[124] However, there is only limited evidence regarding what the lower targets should be. A 2016 systematic review found potential harm to treating to targets lower than 140 mmHg,[125] and a subsequent systematic review in 2019 found no evidence of additional benefit from blood pressure lowering to between 130 – 140mmHg, although there was an increased risk of adverse events.[126]
 2015 American Diabetes Association recommendations are that people with diabetes and albuminuria should receive an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system to reduce the risks of progression to end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events, and death.[127] There is some evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are superior to other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system such as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs),[128] or aliskiren in preventing cardiovascular disease.[129] Although a more recent review found similar effects of ACEIs and ARBs on major cardiovascular and renal outcomes.[130] There is no evidence that combining ACEIs and ARBs provides additional benefits.[130]
 The use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease in diabetes is controversial.[127] Aspirin is recommended by some in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease, however routine use of aspirin has not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes.[131] 2015 American Diabetes Association recommendations for aspirin use (based on expert consensus or clinical experience) are that low-dose aspirin use is reasonable in adults with diabetes who are at intermediate risk of cardiovascular disease (10-year cardiovascular disease risk, 5–10%).[127] National guidelines for England and Wales by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend against the use of aspirin in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who do not have confirmed cardiovascular disease.[120][121]
 Weight loss surgery in those with obesity and type 2 diabetes is often an effective measure.[132] Many are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels with little or no medications following surgery[133] and long-term mortality is decreased.[134] There is, however, a short-term mortality risk of less than 1% from the surgery.[135] The body mass index cutoffs for when surgery is appropriate are not yet clear.[134] It is recommended that this option be considered in those who are unable to get both their weight and blood sugar under control.[136]
 A pancreas transplant is occasionally considered for people with type 1 diabetes who have severe complications of their disease, including end stage kidney disease requiring kidney transplantation.[137]
 Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) affects 30% of all diabetes patients.[138] When DPN is superimposed with nerve compression, DPN may be treatable with multiple nerve decompressions.[139][140] The theory is that DPN predisposes peripheral nerves to compression at anatomical sites of narrowing, and that the majority of DPN symptoms are actually attributable to nerve compression, a treatable condition, rather than DPN itself.[141][142] The surgery is associated with lower pain scores, higher two-point discrimination (a measure of sensory improvement), lower rate of ulcerations, fewer falls (in the case of lower extremity decompression), and fewer amputations.[142][143][144][140]
 In countries using a general practitioner system, such as the United Kingdom, care may take place mainly outside hospitals, with hospital-based specialist care used only in case of complications, difficult blood sugar control, or research projects. In other circumstances, general practitioners and specialists share care in a team approach. Evidence has shown that social prescribing led to slight improvements in blood sugar control for people with type 2 diabetes.[145] Home telehealth support can be an effective management technique.[146]
 The use of technology to deliver educational programs for adults with type 2 diabetes includes computer-based self-management interventions to collect for tailored responses to facilitate self-management.[147] There is no adequate evidence to support effects on cholesterol, blood pressure, behavioral change (such as physical activity levels and dietary), depression, weight and health-related quality of life, nor in other biological, cognitive or emotional outcomes.[147][148]
 In 2017, 425 million people had diabetes worldwide,[149] up from an estimated 382 million people in 2013[150] and from 108 million in 1980.[151] Accounting for the shifting age structure of the global population, the prevalence of diabetes is 8.8% among adults, nearly double the rate of 4.7% in 1980.[149][151] Type 2 makes up about 90% of the cases.[16][34] Some data indicate rates are roughly equal in women and men,[16] but male excess in diabetes has been found in many populations with higher type 2 incidence, possibly due to sex-related differences in insulin sensitivity, consequences of obesity and regional body fat deposition, and other contributing factors such as high blood pressure, tobacco smoking, and alcohol intake.[152][153]
 The WHO estimates that diabetes resulted in 1.5 million deaths in 2012, making it the 8th leading cause of death.[154][151] However another 2.2 million deaths worldwide were attributable to high blood glucose and the increased risks of cardiovascular disease and other associated complications (e.g. kidney failure), which often lead to premature death and are often listed as the underlying cause on death certificates rather than diabetes.[151][155] For example, in 2017, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated that diabetes resulted in 4.0 million deaths worldwide,[149] using modeling to estimate the total number of deaths that could be directly or indirectly attributed to diabetes.[149]
 Diabetes occurs throughout the world but is more common (especially type 2) in more developed countries. The greatest increase in rates has however been seen in low- and middle-income countries,[151] where more than 80% of diabetic deaths occur.[156] The fastest prevalence increase is expected to occur in Asia and Africa, where most people with diabetes will probably live in 2030.[157] The increase in rates in developing countries follows the trend of urbanization and lifestyle changes, including increasingly sedentary lifestyles, less physically demanding work and the global nutrition transition, marked by increased intake of foods that are high energy-dense but nutrient-poor (often high in sugar and saturated fats, sometimes referred to as the ""Western-style"" diet).[151][157] The global number of diabetes cases might increase by 48% between 2017 and 2045.[149]
 As of 2020, 38% of all US adults had prediabetes.[158] Prediabetes is an early stage of diabetes.
 Diabetes was one of the first diseases described,[159] with an Egyptian manuscript from c. 1500 BCE mentioning ""too great emptying of the urine.""[160] The Ebers papyrus includes a recommendation for a drink to take in such cases.[161] The first described cases are believed to have been type 1 diabetes.[160] Indian physicians around the same time identified the disease and classified it as madhumeha or ""honey urine"", noting the urine would attract ants.[160][161]
 The term ""diabetes"" or ""to pass through"" was first used in 230 BCE by the Greek Apollonius of Memphis.[160] The disease was considered rare during the time of the Roman empire, with Galen commenting he had only seen two cases during his career.[160] This is possibly due to the diet and lifestyle of the ancients, or because the clinical symptoms were observed during the advanced stage of the disease. Galen named the disease ""diarrhea of the urine"" (diarrhea urinosa).[162]
 The earliest surviving work with a detailed reference to diabetes is that of Aretaeus of Cappadocia (2nd or early 3rd century CE). He described the symptoms and the course of the disease, which he attributed to the moisture and coldness, reflecting the beliefs of the ""Pneumatic School"". He hypothesized a correlation between diabetes and other diseases, and he discussed differential diagnosis from the snakebite, which also provokes excessive thirst. His work remained unknown in the West until 1552, when the first Latin edition was published in Venice.[162]
 Two types of diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the Indian physicians Sushruta and Charaka in 400–500 CE with one type being associated with youth and another type with being overweight.[160] Effective treatment was not developed until the early part of the 20th century when Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Best isolated and purified insulin in 1921 and 1922.[160] This was followed by the development of the long-acting insulin NPH in the 1940s.[160]
 The word diabetes (/ˌdaɪ.əˈbiːtiːz/ or /ˌdaɪ.əˈbiːtɪs/) comes from Latin diabētēs, which in turn comes from Ancient Greek διαβήτης (diabētēs), which literally means ""a passer through; a siphon"".[163] Ancient Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia (fl. 1st century CE) used that word, with the intended meaning ""excessive discharge of urine"", as the name for the disease.[164][165] Ultimately, the word comes from Greek διαβαίνειν (diabainein), meaning ""to pass through"",[163] which is composed of δια- (dia-), meaning ""through"" and βαίνειν (bainein), meaning ""to go"".[164] The word ""diabetes"" is first recorded in English, in the form diabete, in a medical text written around 1425.
 The word mellitus (/məˈlaɪtəs/ or /ˈmɛlɪtəs/) comes from the classical Latin word mellītus, meaning ""mellite""[166] (i.e. sweetened with honey;[166] honey-sweet[167]). The Latin word comes from mell-, which comes from mel, meaning ""honey"";[166][167] sweetness;[167] pleasant thing,[167] and the suffix -ītus,[166] whose meaning is the same as that of the English suffix ""-ite"".[168] It was Thomas Willis who in 1675 added ""mellitus"" to the word ""diabetes"" as a designation for the disease, when he noticed the urine of a person with diabetes had a sweet taste (glycosuria). This sweet taste had been noticed in urine by the ancient Greeks, Chinese, Egyptians, and Indians.[169]
 The 1989 ""St. Vincent Declaration""[170][171] was the result of international efforts to improve the care accorded to those with diabetes. Doing so is important not only in terms of quality of life and life expectancy but also economically – expenses due to diabetes have been shown to be a major drain on health – and productivity-related resources for healthcare systems and governments.
 Several countries established more and less successful national diabetes programmes to improve treatment of the disease.[172]
 Diabetes stigma describes the negative attitudes, judgment, discrimination, or prejudice against people with diabetes. Often, the stigma stems from the idea that diabetes (particularly Type 2 diabetes) resulted from poor lifestyle and unhealthy food choices rather than other causal factors like genetics and social determinants of health.[173] Manifestation of stigma can be seen throughout different cultures and contexts. Scenarios include diabetes statuses affecting marriage proposals, workplace-employment, and social standing in communities.[174]
 Stigma is also seen internally, as people with diabetes can also have negative beliefs about themselves. Often these cases of self-stigma are associated with higher diabetes-specific distress, lower self-efficacy, and poorer provider-patient interactions during diabetes care.[175]
 Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected with higher prevalence of diabetes compared to non-minority individuals.[176] While US adults overall have a 40% chance of developing type 2 diabetes, Hispanic/Latino adults chance is more than 50%.[177] African Americans also are much more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes compared to White Americans. Asians have increased risk of diabetes as diabetes can develop at lower BMI due to differences in visceral fat compared to other races. For Asians, diabetes can develop at a younger age and lower body fat compared to other groups. Additionally, diabetes is highly underreported in Asian American people, as 1 in 3 cases are undiagnosed compared to the average 1 in 5 for the nation.[178]
 People with diabetes who have neuropathic symptoms such as numbness or tingling in feet or hands are twice as likely to be unemployed as those without the symptoms.[179]
 In 2010, diabetes-related emergency room (ER) visit rates in the United States were higher among people from the lowest income communities (526 per 10,000 population) than from the highest income communities (236 per 10,000 population). Approximately 9.4% of diabetes-related ER visits were for the uninsured.[180]
 The term ""type 1 diabetes"" has replaced several former terms, including childhood-onset diabetes, juvenile diabetes, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Likewise, the term ""type 2 diabetes"" has replaced several former terms, including adult-onset diabetes, obesity-related diabetes, and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Beyond these two types, there is no agreed-upon standard nomenclature.[181]
 Diabetes mellitus is also occasionally known as ""sugar diabetes"" to differentiate it from diabetes insipidus.[182]
 Diabetes can occur in mammals or reptiles.[183][184] Birds do not develop diabetes because of their unusually high tolerance for elevated blood glucose levels.[185]
 In animals, diabetes is most commonly encountered in dogs and cats. Middle-aged animals are most commonly affected. Female dogs are twice as likely to be affected as males, while according to some sources, male cats are more prone than females. In both species, all breeds may be affected, but some small dog breeds are particularly likely to develop diabetes, such as Miniature Poodles.[186]
 Feline diabetes is strikingly similar to human type 2 diabetes. The Burmese, Russian Blue, Abyssinian, and Norwegian Forest cat breeds are at higher risk than other breeds. Overweight cats are also at higher risk.[187]
 The symptoms may relate to fluid loss and polyuria, but the course may also be insidious. Diabetic animals are more prone to infections. The long-term complications recognized in humans are much rarer in animals. The principles of treatment (weight loss, oral antidiabetics, subcutaneous insulin) and management of emergencies (e.g. ketoacidosis) are similar to those in humans.[186]

"Diabetes is a common condition that affects people of all ages. There are several forms of diabetes. Type 2 is the most common. A combination of treatment strategies can help you manage the condition to live a healthy life and prevent complications. Diabetes is a condition that happens when your blood sugar (glucose) is too high. It develops when your pancreas doesn’t make enough insulin or any at all, or when your body isn’t responding to the effects of insulin properly. Diabetes affects people of all ages. Most forms of diabetes are chronic (lifelong), and all forms are manageable with medications and/or lifestyle changes. Glucose (sugar) mainly comes from carbohydrates in your food and drinks. It’s your body’s go-to source of energy. Your blood carries glucose to all your body’s cells to use for energy. When glucose is in your bloodstream, it needs help — a “key” — to reach its final destination. This key is insulin (a hormone). If your pancreas isn’t making enough insulin or your body isn’t using it properly, glucose builds up in your bloodstream, causing high blood sugar (hyperglycemia). Over time, having consistently high blood glucose can cause health problems, such as heart disease, nerve damage and eye issues. The technical name for diabetes is diabetes mellitus. Another condition shares the term “diabetes” — diabetes insipidus — but they’re distinct. They share the name “diabetes” because they both cause increased thirst and frequent urination. Diabetes insipidus is much rarer than diabetes mellitus. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy There are several types of diabetes. The most common forms include: Other types of diabetes include: Diabetes is common. Approximately 37.3 million people in the United States have diabetes, which is about 11% of the population. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form, representing 90% to 95% of all diabetes cases. About 537 million adults across the world have diabetes. Experts predict this number will rise to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045. Advertisement Symptoms of diabetes include: It’s important to talk to your healthcare provider if you or your child has these symptoms. Additional details about symptoms per type of diabetes include: Too much glucose circulating in your bloodstream causes diabetes, regardless of the type. However, the reason why your blood glucose levels are high differs depending on the type of diabetes. Causes of diabetes include: Long-term use of certain medications can also lead to Type 2 diabetes, including HIV/AIDS medications and corticosteroids. Advertisement Diabetes can lead to acute (sudden and severe) and long-term complications — mainly due to extreme or prolonged high blood sugar levels. Acute diabetes complications that can be life-threatening include: Blood glucose levels that remain high for too long can damage your body’s tissues and organs. This is mainly due to damage to your blood vessels and nerves, which support your body’s tissues. Cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) issues are the most common type of long-term diabetes complication. They include: Other diabetes complications include: Living with diabetes can also affect your mental health. People with diabetes are two to three times more likely to have depression than people without diabetes. Healthcare providers diagnose diabetes by checking your glucose level in a blood test. Three tests can measure your blood glucose level: To screen for and diagnose gestational diabetes, providers order an oral glucose tolerance test. The following test results typically indicate if you don’t have diabetes, have prediabetes or have diabetes. These values may vary slightly. In addition, healthcare providers rely on more than one test to diagnose diabetes.  Diabetes is a complex condition, so its management involves several strategies. In addition, diabetes affects everyone differently, so management plans are highly individualized. The four main aspects of managing diabetes include: Due to the increased risk for heart disease, it’s also important to maintain a healthy: You can’t prevent autoimmune and genetic forms of diabetes. But there are some steps you can take to lower your risk for developing prediabetes, Type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes, including: It’s important to note that there are some diabetes risk factors you can’t change, such as your genetics/family history, age and race. Know that Type 2 diabetes is a complex condition that involves many contributing factors. The prognosis (outlook) for diabetes varies greatly depending on several factors, including: Chronic high blood sugar can cause severe complications, which are usually irreversible. Several studies have shown that untreated chronic high blood sugar shortens your lifespan and worsens your quality of life. In the United States, diabetes is the eighth leading cause of death. A large number of people with diabetes will die from a heart attack or stroke. However, it’s important to know that you can live a healthy life with diabetes. The following are key to a better prognosis: Studies show that people with diabetes may be able to reduce their risk of complications by consistently keeping their A1c levels below 7%. If you haven’t been diagnosed with diabetes, you should see a healthcare provider if you have any symptoms of diabetes, such as increased thirst and frequent urination. If you have diabetes, you should see your provider who helps you manage diabetes (such as an endocrinologist) regularly. A note from Cleveland Clinic Being diagnosed with diabetes is a life-changing event, but it doesn’t mean you can’t live a happy and healthy life. Managing diabetes involves consistent care and diligence. While it’ll likely be very overwhelming at first, over time you’ll get a better grasp on managing the condition and being in tune with your body. Be sure to see your healthcare provider(s) regularly. Managing diabetes involves a team effort — you’ll want medical professionals, friends and family on your side. Don’t be afraid to reach out to them if you need help. Last reviewed on 02/17/2023.

"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. Your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t effectively use the insulin it makes.  The hormone insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. If this malfunctions, you may have diabetes. Untreated high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs. But educating yourself about diabetes and taking steps to prevent or manage it can help you protect your health. There are a few different types of diabetes: A rare condition called diabetes insipidus is not related to diabetes mellitus, although it has a similar name. It’s a different condition in which your kidneys remove too much fluid from your body. Each type of diabetes has unique symptoms, causes, and treatments.  Learn more about how these types differ from one another. Prediabetes is the term that’s used when your blood sugar is higher than expected, but it’s not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It occurs when the cells in your body don’t respond to insulin the way they should. This can lead to type 2 diabetes down the road. Experts suggest that more than 1 in 3 Americans have prediabetes, but over 80% of people with prediabetes don’t even know it. Diabetes symptoms are caused by rising blood sugar.  The symptoms of type 1, type 2, and type 1.5 (LADA) are the same, but they occur in a shorter period than types 2 and 1.5. In type 2, the onset tends to be slower. Tingling nerves and slow-healing sores are more common in type 2. Left untreated, type 1, in particular, can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. This is when there is a dangerous level of ketones in the body. It’s less common in other types of diabetes, but still possible. The general symptoms of diabetes include: In addition to the general symptoms of diabetes, men with diabetes may have:  Women with diabetes can have symptoms such as:  Most people who develop gestational diabetes don’t have any symptoms. Healthcare professionals often detect the condition during a routine blood sugar test or oral glucose tolerance test, which is usually performed between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy.  In rare cases, a person with gestational diabetes will also experience increased thirst or urination.  Diabetes symptoms can be so mild that they’re hard to spot at first. Learn which signs should prompt a trip to the doctor. Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.  Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Genes may play a role in some people. It’s also possible that a virus sets off an immune system attack.  Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Having overweight or obesity increases your risk, too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar. This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight. Type 1.5 is an autoimmune condition that occurs when the pancreas is attacked by your own antibodies. as in type 1. It may be genetic, but more research is needed. Gestational diabetes occurs as the result of hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones that make a pregnant person’s cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy.  People who are overweight when they get pregnant or who gain too much weight during pregnancy are more likely to get gestational diabetes.  Both genes and environmental factors play a role in triggering diabetes.  Get more information on the causes of diabetes. Certain factors increase your risk for diabetes. You’re more likely to get type 1 diabetes if you’re a child or teenager, you have a parent or sibling with the condition, or you carry certain genes that are linked to the disease. Your risk for type 2 diabetes increases if you:  Type 2 diabetes also disproportionately affects certain racial and ethnic populations.  Adults who have African American, Hispanic or Latino American, or Asian American ancestry are more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes than white adults, according to 2016 research. They’re also more likely to experience decreased quality of care and increased barriers to self-management. Type 1.5 diabetes is found in adults over 30 and is often mistaken for type 2, but people with this condition are not necessarily overweight, and oral medications and lifestyle changes have no effect. Your risk for gestational diabetes increases if you: Your family history, environment, and preexisting medical conditions can all affect your odds of developing diabetes. Find out which risks you can control and which ones you can’t. High blood sugar damages organs and tissues throughout your body. The higher your blood sugar is and the longer you live with it, the greater your risk for complications.  Complications associated with diabetes include: Unmanaged gestational diabetes can lead to problems that affect both the mother and baby. Complications affecting the baby can include: A pregnant person with gestational diabetes can develop complications such as high blood pressure (preeclampsia) or type 2 diabetes. You may also require cesarean delivery, commonly referred to as a C-section.  The risk of gestational diabetes in future pregnancies also increases.  Diabetes can lead to serious medical complications, but you can manage the condition with medications and lifestyle changes.  Avoid the most common diabetes complications with these helpful tips. Doctors treat diabetes with a few different medications. Some are taken by mouth, while others are available as injections. Insulin is the main treatment for type 1 and 1.5 diabetes. It replaces the hormone your body isn’t able to produce. Various types of insulin are commonly used by people with type 1 and 1.5 diabetes. They differ in how quickly they start to work and how long their effects last: Diet and exercise can help some people manage type 2 diabetes. If lifestyle changes aren’t enough to lower your blood sugar, you’ll need to take medication.  These drugs lower your blood sugar in a variety of ways: You may need to take more than one of these medications. Some people with type 2 diabetes also take insulin. If you receive a diagnosis of gestational diabetes, you’ll need to monitor your blood sugar level several times per day during pregnancy. If it’s high, dietary changes and exercise may be enough to bring it down. Research has found that about 15% to 30% of women who develop gestational diabetes will need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Insulin is safe for the developing baby. The treatment regimen your doctor recommends will depend on the type of diabetes you have and its cause.  Check out this list of the various medications that are available to treat diabetes. Healthy eating is a central part of managing diabetes. In some cases, changing your diet may be enough to manage the disease.  Your blood sugar level rises or falls based on the types of foods you eat. Starchy or sugary foods make blood sugar levels rise rapidly. Protein and fat cause more gradual increases. Your medical team may recommend that you limit the amount of carbohydrates you eat each day. You’ll also need to balance your carb intake with your insulin doses. Counting carbs helps to balance the carb intake with the insulin doses. Check out this guide to starting a type 1 diabetes diet. Eating the right types of foods can both manage your blood sugar and help you lose any excess weight. Carb counting is an important part of eating for type 2 diabetes. A dietitian can help you figure out how many grams of carbohydrates to eat at each meal. In order to keep your blood sugar levels steady, try to eat small meals throughout the day. Emphasize healthy foods such as: Certain other foods can hurt efforts to manage your blood sugar.  Discover the foods you should avoid if you have diabetes. Eating a well-balanced diet is important for both you and your baby during these 9 months. Making the right food choices can also help you avoid diabetes medications. Watch your portion sizes, and limit sugary or salty foods. Although you need some sugar to feed your growing baby, you should avoid eating too much. Check out other do’s and don’ts for healthy eating with gestational diabetes.  Work with a registered dietitian if you have access to one. They can help you design an individualized diabetes meal plan. Getting the right balance of protein, fat, and carbs can help you manage your blood sugar.  Along with diet and treatment, exercise plays an essential role in diabetes management. This is true for all types of diabetes.  Staying active helps your cells react to insulin more effectively and lower your blood sugar levels. Exercising regularly can also help you: If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, general guidance is to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week. There are currently no separate exercise guidelines for people who have gestational diabetes. But if you’re pregnant, start out slowly and gradually increase your activity level over time to avoid overdoing it.  Diabetes-friendly exercises include: Talk with your doctor about safe ways to incorporate activity into your diabetes management plan. You may need to follow special precautions, like checking your blood sugar before and after working out and making sure to stay hydrated. Consider working with a personal trainer or exercise physiologist who has experience working with people who have diabetes. They can help you develop a personalized workout plan tailored to your needs. Anyone who has symptoms of diabetes or is at risk for the condition should be tested. People are routinely tested for gestational diabetes during their second trimester or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors use these blood tests to diagnose prediabetes and diabetes: To diagnose gestational diabetes, your doctor will test your blood sugar levels between the 24th week and 28th week of pregnancy. There are two types of tests: The earlier you are diagnosed with diabetes, the sooner you can start treatment. Find out whether you should get tested, and get more information on tests your doctor might perform.  If you don’t already have a primary care specialist, you can browse doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool. Type 1 and type 1.5 diabetes are not preventable because they are caused by an issue with the immune system. Some causes of type 2 diabetes, such as your genes or age, aren’t under your control either.  Yet many other diabetes risk factors are manageable. Most diabetes prevention strategies involve making simple adjustments to your diet and fitness routine. If you’ve received a diagnosis of prediabetes, here are a few things you can do to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes: These aren’t the only ways to prevent diabetes. Discover more strategies that may help you avoid this chronic health condition. People who’ve never had diabetes can suddenly develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Hormones produced by the placenta can make your body more resistant to the effects of insulin.  People can have diabetes before they conceive and carry it with them into pregnancy. This is called pre-gestational diabetes. Diabetes during pregnancy can lead to complications for your newborn, such as jaundice or breathing problems.  If you’re diagnosed with pre-gestational or gestational diabetes, you’ll need special monitoring to prevent complications. Gestational diabetes should go away after you deliver, but it does significantly increase your risk of getting diabetes later. About half of people with gestational diabetes will go on to develop type 2 diabetes.  Children can get both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Managing blood sugar is especially important in young people because diabetes can damage important organs such as the heart and kidneys.  The autoimmune form of diabetes often starts in childhood. One of the main symptoms is increased urination. Kids with type 1 diabetes may start wetting the bed after they’ve been toilet trained.  Extreme thirst, fatigue, and hunger are also signs of the condition. It’s important that children with type 1 diabetes get treatment right away. The condition can cause high blood sugar, dehydration, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which can be medical emergencies. Type 1 diabetes used to be called juvenile diabetes because type 2 was so rare in children. Now that more children have overweight or obesity, type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in this age group. Some children living with type 2 diabetes don’t experience symptoms. Others may experience: Type 2 diabetes is often diagnosed based on medical history, a physical exam, and bloodwork. Untreated type 2 diabetes can cause lifelong complications, including heart disease, kidney disease, and blindness. Healthy eating and exercise can help your child manage their blood sugar and prevent these problems. Type 2 diabetes is more prevalent than ever in young people. Learn how to spot the signs so you can report them to your child’s doctor. Some types of diabetes — like types 1 and 1.5 — are caused by factors that are out of your control. Others — like type 2 — can be prevented by making better food choices, increasing activity, and losing weight. Discuss potential diabetes risks with your doctor. If you’re at risk, have your blood sugar tested and follow your doctor’s advice for managing your blood sugar.

"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of inherited disorders that affect your connective tissues — primarily your skin, joints and blood vessel walls. Connective tissue is a complex mixture of proteins and other substances that provide strength and elasticity to the underlying structures in your body. People who have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome usually have overly flexible joints and stretchy, fragile skin. This can become a problem if you have a wound that requires stitches, because the skin often isn't strong enough to hold them. A more severe form of the disorder, called vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can cause the walls of your blood vessels, intestines or uterus to rupture. Because vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can have serious potential complications in pregnancy, you may want to talk to a genetic counselor before starting a family. There are many different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the most common signs and symptoms include: Symptom severity can vary from person to person and depends on the specific type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that you have. The most common type is called hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome often share distinctive facial features of a thin nose, thin upper lip, small earlobes and prominent eyes. They also have thin, translucent skin that bruises very easily. In fair-skinned people, the underlying blood vessels are very visible through the skin. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can weaken your heart's largest artery (aorta), as well as the arteries to other regions of your body. A rupture of any of these larger blood vessels can be fatal. The vascular type can also weaken the walls of the uterus or large intestines — which also may rupture. Different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are associated with a variety of genetic causes, some of which are inherited and passed on from parent to child. If you have the most common form, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, there's a 50% chance that you'll pass on the gene to each of your children. Complications depend on the types of signs and symptoms you have. For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early-onset arthritis. Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are at risk of often fatal ruptures of major blood vessels. Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus. If you have a personal or family history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and you're thinking about starting a family, you may benefit from talking to a genetic counselor — a health care professional trained to assess the risk of inherited disorders. Genetic counseling can help you understand the inheritance pattern of the type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that affects you and the risks it poses for your children.

"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a genetic condition that makes your body’s connective tissue weaker than it should be. It commonly affects your skin and joints. There’s no cure, but your healthcare provider will help you find treatments to manage your symptoms and prevent potentially dangerous complications. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a condition that affects the connective tissues in your body. Connective tissues support your organs and hold parts of your body in place. They’re made of two proteins: collagen and elastin. EDS affects your body’s ability to produce collagen the way it should. People with EDS have weaker collagen. This means their connective tissue isn’t as strong or supportive as it should be. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can affect any connective tissue in your body, including your: Depending on where EDS affects your connective tissue, you might experience symptoms in your: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a genetic disorder. Talk to a healthcare provider about testing for EDS if someone in your biological family has it (an immediate relative like a biological parent, grandparent or sibling). Healthcare providers classify Ehlers-Danlos syndrome into 13 types based on where it affects you and the symptoms it causes. The most common types cause symptoms like loose or unstable joints and fragile skin that tears easily. Some rare types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can cause fatal complications — especially vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS that affects your blood vessels). Your provider will tell you which type of EDS you have and which treatments you’ll need to manage your symptoms. Experts estimate that 1 in 5,000 people has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Policy Each type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome has its own symptoms, but the most common EDS symptoms include: A genetic mutation causes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Genetic mutations are changes to your DNA sequence that happen during cell division when your cells make copies of themselves. If part of your DNA sequence is in the wrong place, isn’t complete or is damaged, you might experience symptoms of a genetic condition. Even though we know it’s caused by a genetic mutation, healthcare providers can’t always identify the exact mutation that causes Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in someone. Experts have identified more than 20 different genetic mutations that can cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. They all affect your body’s ability to produce collagen. Which specific mutation you have determines which parts of your body are affected. Some types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are inheritable. This means biological parents can pass the mutations to their children. Other types happen somatically — they happen randomly and can’t be passed through generations of a family. You may have an increased risk of EDS if one or both of your biological parents have it. Similarly, if you have EDS, you might pass the mutation that caused it to your biological children. Talk to a healthcare provider about your risk of inheriting or passing on Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in your biological family. Your provider might suggest genetic counseling. Genetic counselors can help you determine your risk for developing or passing on certain conditions. Advertisement Dislocations are the most common complication of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. A dislocation is the medical term for bones in one of your joints being pushed out of their usual place. Never try to push a joint back into place on your own if you think you have a dislocation. Go to the emergency room (ER) right away. You may need surgery to repair a dislocation. Some types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can cause life-threatening complications. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can cause blood vessels to rupture (tear). This can lead to dangerous internal bleeding and stroke. People with these types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome also have a higher risk of organ rupture. The most common types of organ rupture are intestines and a pregnant person’s uterus. Your risk of complications depends on which type of EDS you have. Complications can include: A healthcare provider will diagnose Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with a physical exam and by discussing your medical history. They’ll examine your skin and joints and ask you about your symptoms. Tell your provider when you first noticed symptoms or if any activities make them worse. Most people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome don’t have a known genetic mutation, so providers usually diagnose it based on your symptoms and medical history. Advertisement Your healthcare provider will suggest treatments for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that help you manage your symptoms and prevent dangerous complications. Which treatments will work for you depends on which type of EDS you have and how your connective tissue is affected. Some common Ehlers-Danlos syndrome treatments include: People with Ehlers-Danlos have an increased risk of dislocated joints and other joint injuries. Your provider might suggest you avoid: No, you can’t prevent Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Because you can’t control the genetic mutations that cause it, there’s no way to prevent EDS. Talk to your healthcare provider about genetic counseling if you’re worried about passing EDS (or any other genetic condition) on to your biological children. You should expect to manage Ehlers-Danlos syndrome symptoms for the rest of your life. There’s no cure for EDS. But you should be able to participate in all your normal activities once you learn how to manage your symptoms. You might have to avoid some forms of intense physical activity (like contact sports). Ehlers-Danlos syndrome affects everyone differently. What you experience depends on which type of EDS you have and the severity of your symptoms. Ask your provider what to expect based on your unique situation. Most types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome don’t affect or lower your life expectancy. If you have EDS that affects your blood vessels (vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), you might have an increased risk of experiencing a stroke or other fatal vascular issues. Even if you have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, your healthcare provider will help you find a combination of treatments and lifestyle changes that help you lead a safe, healthy life. Talk to your provider about what to expect and which signs or symptoms of dangerous complications you should watch for. Monitor your symptoms and visit a healthcare provider if you notice any changes. Your provider will tell you how often you need regular visits in the future to track any changes in your body. They’ll help you change your treatments as needed. Avoid playing high-impact sports. Intense physical activity like contact sports increases your risk of a joint injury (especially dislocations). Visit a healthcare provider if you notice any changes in your body that make your skin or joints feel weaker or loose. See a provider if you notice that you’re bruising or bleeding more often than you used to. Got to the emergency room or call 911 (or your local emergency number) if you or someone with you has symptoms of a stroke. To recognize the warning signs of a stroke, remember to think, BE FAST: A note from Cleveland Clinic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a genetic condition that affects your body’s ability to produce collagen that supports your connective tissue.

"Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of 13 genetic connective-tissue disorders.[7] Symptoms often include loose joints, joint pain, stretchy velvety skin, and abnormal scar formation.[1] These may be noticed at birth or in early childhood.[3] Complications may include aortic dissection, joint dislocations, scoliosis, chronic pain, or early osteoarthritis.[1][4] The current classification was last updated in 2017, when a number of rarer forms of EDS were added.[1][8]
 EDS occurs due to variations of more than 19 genes that are present at birth.[1] The specific gene affected determines the type of EDS, though the genetic causes of hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS) are still unknown.[1][9] Some cases result from a new variation occurring during early development, while others are inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive manner.[1] Typically, these variations result in defects in the structure or processing of the protein collagen or tenascin.[1]
 Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing or skin biopsy, particularly with hEDS, but people may initially be misdiagnosed with hypochondriasis, depression, or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.[4] Genetic testing can be used to confirm all other types of EDS.[9]
 A cure is not yet known,[6] and treatment is supportive in nature.[4] Physical therapy and bracing may help strengthen muscles and support joints.[4] Some forms of EDS result in a normal life expectancy, but those that affect blood vessels generally decrease it.[6] All forms of EDS can result in fatal outcomes for some patients.[10][11][12]
 While hEDS affects at least one in 5,000 people globally,[1][13] other types occur at lower frequencies.[10][8] The prognosis depends on the specific disorder.[4] Excess mobility was first described by Hippocrates in 400 BC.[14] The syndromes are named after two physicians, Edvard Ehlers and Henri-Alexandre Danlos, who described them at the turn of the 20th century.[15]
 In 2017, 13 subtypes of EDS were classified using specific diagnostic criteria.[5] According to the Ehlers–Danlos Society, the syndromes can also be grouped by the symptoms determined by specific gene mutations. Group A disorders are those that affect primary collagen structure and processing. Group B disorders affect collagen folding and crosslinking. Group C are disorders of structure and function of myomatrix. Group D disorders are those that affect glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. Group E disorders are characterized by defects in the complement pathway. Group F are disorders of intracellular processes, and Group G is considered to be unresolved forms of EDS.[16]
 Hypermobile EDS (hEDS, formerly categorized as type 3) is mainly characterized by hypermobility that affects both large and small joints. It may lead to frequent joint subluxations (partial dislocations) and dislocations. In general, people with this variant have skin that is soft, smooth, and velvety and bruises easily, and may have chronic muscle and/or bone pain.[5] It affects the skin less than other forms. It has no available genetic test.[17] hEDS is the most common of the 19 types of connective tissue disorders. Since no genetic test exists, providers have to diagnose hEDS based on what they know about the condition and the patient's physical attributes. Other than the general signs, attributes can include faulty connective tissues throughout the body, musculoskeletal issues, and family history. Along with these general signs and side effects, patients can have trouble healing.[18]
 Pregnant individuals who have hEDS are at an increased risk for complications. Some possible complications are pre-labor rupture of membranes, a drop in blood pressure with anesthesia, precipitate birth (very fast, active labor), malposition of the fetus, and increased bleeding. Individuals with hEDS may run the risk of falling, postpartum depression (more than the general population), and slow healing from the birthing process.[19]
 The Medical University of South Carolina discovered a gene variant common with hEDS patients.[20]
 While 12 of the 13 subtypes of EDS have genetic variations that can be tested for by genetic testing, there is no known genetic cause of hEDS. Recently, several labs and research initiatives have been attempting to uncover a potential hEDS gene. In 2018, the Ehlers–Danlos Society began the Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos Genetic Evaluation (HEDGE) study.[21] The ongoing study has screened over 1,000 people who have been diagnosed with hEDS by the 2017 criteria to evaluate their genome for a common mutation. To date, 200 people with hEDS have had whole genome sequencing, and 500 have had whole exome sequencing; this study aims to increase those numbers significantly.[citation needed]
 Promising outcomes of this increased screening have been reported by the Norris Lab, led by Russell Norris, in the Department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology at Medical University of South Carolina.[22] Using CRISPR Cas-9 mediated genome editing on mouse models of the disease, the lab has recently identified a ""very strong candidate gene""[23] for hEDS. This finding, and a greater understanding of cardiac complications associated with the majority of EDS subtypes, has led to the development of multiple druggable pathways involved in aortic and mitral valve diseases. While this candidate gene has not been publicly identified, the Norris lab has conducted several studies involving small population genome sequencing and come up with a working list of possible hEDS genes. A mutation in COL3A1[24] in a single family with autosomal dominant hEDS phenotype was found to cause reduced collagen secretion and an over-modification of collagen. In 35 families, copy number alterations in TPSAB1,[25] encoding alpha-tryptase, were associated with increased basal serum tryptase levels, associated with autonomic dysfunction, gastrointestinal disorders, allergic and cutaneous symptoms, and connective tissue abnormalities, all concurrent with hEDS phenotype. Lastly, Tenascin X,[26] an extracellular matrix protein important for collagen mutation encoded by the TNXB gene, has been associated with hEDS in patients with Tenascin X deficiency.[citation needed]
 Another way the Norris lab is attempting to find this gene is by looking at genes involved in the formation of the aorta and mitral valves, as these valves are often prolapsed or malformed as a symptom of EDS. Because hEDS is such a complex, multi-organ disease, focusing on one hallmark trait has proven successful. One gene found this way is DZIP1, which regulates cardiac valve development in mammals through a CBY1-beta-catenin mechanism. Mutations at this gene affect the beta-catenin cascade involved in development, causing malformation of the extracellular matrix, resulting in loss of collagen. A lack of collagen here is both consistent with hEDS and explains the ""floppy"" mitral and aortic valve heart defects. A second genetic study specific to mitral valve prolapse focused on the PDGF signaling pathway, which is involved in growth factor ligands and receptor isoforms.[27] Mutations in this pathway affect the ability to localize cilia in various cell types, including cardiac cells. With the resulting ciliopathies, structures such as the cardiac outflow tract, heart tube assembly, and cardiac fusion are limited and/or damaged.[citation needed]
 Classical EDS is characterized by extremely elastic skin that is fragile and bruises easily and hypermobility of the joints. Molluscoid pseudotumors (calcified hematomas that occur over pressure points) and spheroids (cysts that contain fat occurring over forearms and shins) are also often seen. A side complication of the hyperelasticity presented in many EDS cases makes wounds closing on their own more difficult.[28] Sometimes, motor development is delayed and hypotonia occurs.[5] The variation causing this type of EDS is in the genes COL5A2, COL5A1, and less frequently COL1A1. It involves the skin more than hEDS.[28] In classical EDS, large variation in symptom presentation is seen. Because of this variance, EDS has often been underdiagnosed.[29] Without genetic testing, healthcare professionals may be able to provide a provisional diagnosis based on careful examination of the mouth, skin, and bones, as well as by neurological assessment.[30]
 A good way to begin the diagnosis process is looking at family history. EDS is an autosomal dominant condition, so is often inherited from parents.[28] Genetic testing remains the most reliable way to diagnose EDS.[31] No cure for type 1 EDS has been found, but a course of non-weight-bearing exercise can help with muscular tension, which can help correct some EDS symptoms. Anti-inflammatory drugs and lifestyle changes can help with joint pain. Lifestyle choices should also be made with children who have EDS to try to prevent wounds to the skin. Protective garments can help with this. In a wound, deep stitches are often used and left in place for longer than normal.[28]
 Vascular EDS (formerly categorized as type 4) is identified by skin that is thin, translucent, extremely fragile, and bruises easily. It is also characterized by fragile blood vessels and organs that can easily rupture. Affected people are frequently short, and have thin scalp hair. It also has characteristic facial features, including large eyes, an undersized chin, sunken cheeks, a thin nose and lips, and ears without lobes.[32] Joint hypermobility is present, but generally confined to the small joints (fingers, toes). Other common features include club foot, tendon and/or muscle rupture, acrogeria (premature aging of the skin of the hands and feet), early-onset varicose veins, pneumothorax (collapse of a lung), the recession of the gums, and a decreased amount of fat under the skin.[5] It can be caused by the variations in the COL3A1 gene.[32] Rarely, COL1A1 variations can also cause it.[8]
 Kyphoscoliosis EDS (formerly categorized as type 6) is associated with severe hypotonia at birth, delayed motor development, progressive scoliosis (present from birth), and scleral fragility. People may also have easy bruising, fragile arteries that are prone to rupture, unusually small corneas, and osteopenia (low bone density). Other common features include a ""marfanoid habitus"" characterized by long, slender fingers (arachnodactyly), unusually long limbs, and a sunken chest (pectus excavatum) or protruding chest (pectus carinatum).[5] It can be caused by variations in the gene PLOD1, or rarely, in the FKBP14 gene.[33]
 Arthrochalasia EDS (formerly categorized as types 7A and B) is characterized by severe joint hypermobility and congenital hip dislocation. Other common features include fragile, elastic skin with easy bruising, hypotonia, kyphoscoliosis (kyphosis and scoliosis), and mild osteopenia.[5] Type-I collagen is usually affected. It is very rare, with about 30 cases reported. It is more severe than the hypermobility type. Variations in the genes COL1A1 and COL1A2 cause it.[34]
 Dermatosparaxis EDS (formerly categorized as type 7C) is associated with extremely fragile skin leading to severe bruising and scarring; saggy, redundant skin, especially on the face; hypermobility ranging from mild to serious; and hernias. Variations in the ADAMTS2 gene cause it. It is extremely rare, with around 11 cases reported.[35]
 Brittle-cornea syndrome is characterized by the progressive thinning of the cornea, early-onset progressive keratoglobus or keratoconus, nearsightedness, hearing loss, and blue sclerae.[5][36] Classic symptoms, such as hypermobile joints and hyperelastic skin, are also seen often.[37] It has two types. Type 1 occurs due to variations in the ZNF469 gene. Type 2 is due to variations in the PRDM5 gene.[36]
 Classical-like EDS is characterized by skin hyperextensibility with velvety skin texture and absence of atrophic scarring, generalized joint hypermobility with or without recurrent dislocations (most often shoulder and ankle), and easily bruised skin or spontaneous ecchymoses (discolorations of the skin resulting from bleeding underneath).[5] It can be caused by variations in the TNXB gene.[8]
 Spondylodysplastic EDS is characterized by short stature (progressive in childhood), muscle hypotonia (ranging from severe congenital to mild later-onset), and bowing of limbs.[5] It can be caused by variations in both copies of the B4GALT7 gene. Other cases can be caused by variations in the B3GALT6 gene. People with variations in this gene can have kyphoscoliosis, tapered fingers, osteoporosis, aortic aneurysms, and problems with the lungs. Other cases can be caused by the SLC39A13 gene. Those with variations in this gene have protuberant eyes, wrinkled palms of the hands, tapering fingers, and distal joint hypermobility.[38]
 Musculocontractural EDS is characterized by congenital multiple contractures, characteristically adduction-flexion contractures and/or talipes equinovarus (clubfoot), characteristic craniofacial features, which are evident at birth or in early infancy, and skin features such as skin hyperextensibility, bruising, skin fragility with atrophic scars, and increased palmar wrinkling.[5] It can be caused by variations in the CHST14 gene. Some other cases can be caused by variations in the DSE gene.[39]
 As of 2021, 48 individuals have been reported to have mcEDS-CHST14, while 8 individuals have mcEDS-DSE.[40]
 Bethlem myopathy 2, formally known as Myopathic EDS (mEDS), is characterized by three major criteria: congenital muscle hypotonia and/or muscle atrophy that improves with age, proximal joint contractures of the knee, hip, and elbow, and hypermobility of distal joints (ankles, wrists, feet, and hands).[5] Four minor criteria may also contribute to a diagnosis of mEDS. This disorder can be inherited through either an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive pattern.[16] Molecular testing must be completed to verify that mutations in the COL12A1 gene are present; if not, other collagen-type myopathies should be considered.[16]
 Periodontal EDS (pEDS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder[16] characterized by four major criteria of severe and intractable periodontitis of early-onset (childhood or adolescence), lack of attached gingiva, pretibial plaques, and family history of a first-degree relative who meets clinical criteria.[5] Eight minor criteria may also contribute to the diagnosis of pEDS. Molecular testing may reveal mutations in C1R or C1S genes affecting the C1r protein.[16]
 Cardiac-valvular EDS (cvEDS) is characterized by three major criteria: severe progressive cardiac-valvular problems (affecting aortic and mitral valves), skin problems such as hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, thin skin, and easy bruising, and joint hypermobility (generalized or restricted to small joints).[5] Four minor criteria may aid in diagnosis of cvEDS.[16] cvEDS is an autosomal recessive disorder, inherited through variation in both alleles of the gene COL1A2.[41]
 This group of disorders affects connective tissues across the body, with symptoms most typically present in the joints, skin, and blood vessels. However, as connective tissue is found throughout the body, EDS may result in an array of unexpected impacts with any degree of severity, and the condition is not limited to joints, skin, and blood vessels.[42] Effects may range from mildly loose joints to life-threatening cardiovascular complications.[43] Due to the diversity of subtypes within the EDS family, symptoms may vary widely between individuals diagnosed with EDS.[44]
 Musculoskeletal symptoms include hyperflexible joints that are unstable and prone to sprain, dislocation, subluxation, and hyperextension.[4][15] As a result of frequent tissue injury, there can be an early onset of advanced osteoarthritis,[45] chronic degenerative joint disease,[45] swan-neck deformity of the fingers,[46] and Boutonniere deformity of the fingers. Tendon and ligament laxity offer minuscule protection from tearing in muscles and tendons, but these problems still persist.[47]
 Deformities of the spine, such as scoliosis (curvature of the spine), kyphosis (a thoracic hump), tethered spinal cord syndrome, craniocervical instability (CCI), and atlantoaxial instability may also be present.[48][49] Osteoporosis and osteopenia are also associated with EDS and symptomatic joint hypermobility[50][51]
 There can also be myalgia (muscle pain) and arthralgia (joint pain),[52] which may be severe and disabling. Trendelenburg's sign is often seen, which means that when standing on one leg, the pelvis drops on the other side.[53] Osgood–Schlatter disease, a painful lump on the knee, is common as well.[54] In infants, walking can be delayed (beyond 18 months of age), and bottom-shuffling instead of crawling occurs.[55]
 The weak connective tissue causes abnormal skin. This may present as stretchy or in other types simply be velvet soft. In all types, some increased fragility occurs, but the degree varies depending on the underlying subtype. The skin may tear and bruise easily, and may heal with abnormal atrophic scars;[45] atrophic scars that look like cigarette paper are a sign seen including in those whose skin might appear otherwise normal.[1][15][28] In some subtypes, though not the hypermobile subtype, redundant skin folds occur, especially on the eyelids. Redundant skin folds are areas of excess skin lying in folds.[45][56]
 Other skin symptoms include molluscoid pseudotumors,[57] especially on pressure points, petechiae,[58] subcutaneous spheroids,[57] livedo reticularis, and piezogenic papules are less common.[59] In vascular EDS, skin can also be thin and translucent. In dermatosparaxis EDS, the skin is extremely fragile and saggy.[1]
 Weakened connective tissues can lead to pelvic organ prolapse in female patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.[66] Natal Female Patients may also experience voiding difficulties, frequent urinary tract infections, and incontinence due to structural abnormalities.[67]  Pelvic girdle pain is also frequently reported.[68]
 Menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia are common symptoms associated with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome[69] and are often mistaken for endometriosis.[69] Excessive menstrual bleeding can sometimes be attributed to inappropriate platelet aggregation, but faulty collagen leads to weakened capillary walls which increases likelihood of hemorrhage.[70]
 In cases of pregnancy, patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome are more likely to experience complications during parturition.[70] Post-partum hemorrhage and maternal injury such as sporadic pelvic displacement, hip dislocation, torn and stretched ligaments, and skin tearing can all be linked to altered structure of connective tissues[71]
 Research suggests a correlation between connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and both structural and functional problems within the gastrointestinal tract.[72]
 High incidences of coexisting inflammatory disorders suggest a correlation between connective tissue disorders and the development of such aforementioned conditions. Inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis[73] and Celiac disease[74] are more common in EDS patients when compared to control groups. Of note, patients who are already diagnosed with an inflammatory bowel disorder are not necessarily likely to develop symptoms of a connective tissue disorder, as the two have separate but not totally confounding etiologies.[75] Eosinophilic esophagitis, an inflammatory condition characterized by allergic-type reactions to various foods and chemicals and extensive esophageal remodeling, is eight times more likely in patients with connective tissue disorders when compared to patients without.[76]
 Functionally, small bowel dysmotility, delayed gastric emptying and delayed colonic transit are commonly related to EDS.[77][78] These changes in transit speeds within the gastrointestinal system can cause a host of symptoms, including but not limited to abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, reflux symptoms, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea[79]
 Some studies also suggest problems with the liver, which is in large part responsible for bilirubin conjugation. Although research in this area is sparse, patients with joint hypermobility were found to have higher rates of indirect hyperbilirubinemia than control groups[80]
 Structurally, changes within the musculature in the intestine such as increased elastin, can lead to increased frequency of herniation.[72] Laxity of the phreno-esophageal and gastro-hepatic ligaments can lead to hiatal hernia,[81][82] which in turn can lead to commonly reported symptoms such as acid reflux, abdominal pain, early satiety, and bloating. Internal organ prolapses and intestinal intussusceptions occur with greater frequency in patients with weakened connective tissues.[83]
 Although neurogastroenterological manifestations in connective tissue disorders are common, their root cause is not yet known.[82]  Splanchnic circulation, small fiber neuropathy and altered vascular compliance have all been named as potential contributors to gastrointestinal complaints[84] particularly for patients who have a known, comorbid autonomic condition.
 Chronic headaches are common in patients with Ehlers Danlos syndrome, whether related to dysautonomia,[85] TMJ, muscle tension, or craniocervical instability. Craniocervical instability is caused by trauma(s) to the head and neck areas such as concussion and whiplash. Ligaments in neck are unable to heal properly, so the neck structure does not have the ability to support the skull, which can then sink into the brain stem, blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, which in turn causes autonomic dysfunction.[86][49]
 Arnold–Chiari malformation[87] is also more frequently found in patients with EDS because of the instability at the juncture between skull and spine. This causes herniation of the posterior fossa below the foramen magnum.[88] Increased pressure created by the malformation can lead to a flattened pituitary glad, hormone changes, sudden severe headaches, ataxia, and poor proprioception[89]
 Ophthalmological manifestations include nearsightedness, retinal tearing and retinal detachment, keratoconus, blue sclera, dry eye, Sjogren's syndrome, lens subluxation, angioid streaks, epicanthal folds, strabismus, corneal scarring, brittle cornea syndrome, cataracts, carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas, macular degeneration.[90]
 Otological complications may also occur. Hearing loss is common, both conductive and sensorineural, and is most often bilateral.[91] Otosclerosis and instability of the bones in the inner ear may also contribute to hearing loss[92]
 Because it is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in childhood, some instances of EDS have been mischaracterized as child abuse.[104] The pain may also be misdiagnosed as a behavior disorder or Munchausen by proxy.[105]
 The pain associated with EDS ranges from mild to debilitating.[106]
 Every type of EDS except the hypermobile type (which affects the vast majority of people with EDS) can be positively tied to specific genetic variation[citation needed].
 Variations in these genes can cause EDS:[8]
 Variations in these genes usually alter the structure, production, or processing of collagen or proteins that interact with collagen. Collagen provides structure and strength to connective tissue. A defect in collagen can weaken connective tissue in the skin, bones, blood vessels, and organs, resulting in the features of the disorder.[1] Inheritance patterns depend on the specific syndrome.
 Most forms of EDS are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause a disorder. A few are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected. It can also be an individual (de novo or ""sporadic"") variation. Sporadic variations occur without any inheritance.[107]
 A diagnosis can be made by an evaluation of medical history and clinical observation. The Beighton criteria are widely used to assess the degree of joint hypermobility. DNA and biochemical studies can help identify affected people. Diagnostic tests include collagen gene-variant testing, collagen typing via skin biopsy, echocardiogram, and lysyl hydroxylase or oxidase activity, but these tests are not able to confirm all cases, especially in instances of an unmapped variation, so clinical evaluation remains important. If multiple members of a family are affected, prenatal diagnosis may be possible using a DNA information technique known as a linkage study.[108] Knowledge about EDS among all kinds of practitioners is poor.[109][110] Research is ongoing to identify genetic markers for all types.[111]
 Several disorders share some characteristics with EDS. For example, in cutis laxa, the skin is loose, hanging, and wrinkled. In EDS, the skin can be pulled away from the body, but is elastic and returns to normal when let go. In Marfan syndrome, the joints are very mobile and similar cardiovascular complications occur. People with a ""marfanoid"" appearance are often tall and thin with long arms and legs and ""spidery"" fingers while EDS phenotypes vary considerably. Certain subtypes of EDS may involve short stature, large eyes, and the appearance of a small mouth and chin, due to a small palate. The palate can have a high arch, causing dental crowding. Blood vessels can sometimes be easily seen through translucent skin, especially on the chest. The genetic connective tissue disorder Loeys–Dietz syndrome also has symptoms that overlap with EDS.[112]
 In the past, Menkes disease, a copper metabolism disorder, was thought to be a form of EDS. People are commonly misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia, bleeding disorders, or other disorders that can mimic EDS symptoms. Because of these similar disorders and complications that can arise from an unmonitored case of EDS, a correct diagnosis is important.[113] Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is worth consideration in diagnosis.[114]
 No cure for Ehlers–Danlos syndrome is known, and treatment is supportive. Close monitoring of the cardiovascular system, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and orthopedic instruments (e.g., wheelchairs, bracing, casting) may be helpful. This can help stabilize the joints and prevent injury. Orthopedic instruments are helpful for the prevention of further joint damage, especially for long distances. People should avoid activities that cause the joint to lock or overextend.[115]
 A physician may prescribe casting to stabilize joints. Physicians may refer a person to an orthotist for orthotic treatment (bracing). Physicians may also consult a physical and/or occupational therapist to help strengthen muscles and to teach people how to properly use and preserve their joints.[116][117]
 Aquatic therapy promotes muscular development and coordination.[118] With manual therapy, the joint is gently mobilized within the range of motion and/or manipulations.[116][117] If conservative therapy is not helpful, surgical joint repair may be necessary. Medication to decrease pain or manage cardiac, digestive, or other related conditions may be prescribed. To decrease bruising and improve wound healing, some people have responded to vitamin C.[119] Medical care workers often take special precautions because of the sheer number of complications that tend to arise in people with EDS. In vascular EDS, signs of chest or abdominal pain are considered trauma situations.[120]
 Cannabinoids and medical marijuana have shown some efficacy in reducing pain levels.[121]
 In general, medical intervention is limited to symptomatic therapy. Before pregnancy, people with EDS may be recommended to have genetic counseling and to familiarize themselves with the risks pregnancy poses. Children with EDS should be given information about the disorder so they can understand why they should avoid contact sports and other physically stressful activities. Children should be taught that they should not demonstrate the unusual positions they can maintain due to loose joints, as this may cause early degeneration of the joints. Emotional support along with behavioral and psychological therapy can be useful. Support groups can be immensely helpful for people dealing with major lifestyle changes and poor health. Family members, teachers, and friends should be informed about EDS so they can accept and assist the child.[122]
 Successful treatment of chronic pain in EDS requires a multidisciplinary team. The ways to manage pain can be to modify pain management techniques used in the normal population. Pain is classified into several types. One is nociceptive, which is caused by an injury sustained to tissues. Another is neuropathic pain, caused by abnormal signals by the nervous system. In many cases, the pain individuals experience is an unequal mix of the two. Physiotherapy (exercise rehabilitation) can be helpful, especially stabilizing the core and the joints. Stretching exercises must be reduced to slow and gentle stretching to reduce the risks of dislocations or subluxations. Usable methods may include posture reeducation, muscle release, joint mobilization, trunk stabilization, and manual therapy for overworked muscles. Cognitive behavioural therapy is used in many chronic pain patients, especially those who have severe, chronic, life-controlling pain that is unresponsive to treatment. It has not been checked for efficiency in clinical trials. The state of pain management with EDS is considered insufficient.[105]
 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help if the pain is caused by inflammation. But long-term use of NSAIDs is often a risk factor for gastrointestinal, renal, and blood-related side effects. It can worsen symptoms of mast cell activation syndrome, a disease that may be associated with EDS. Acetaminophen can be used to avoid the bleeding-related side effects of NSAIDs.[105]
 Opioids have shown efficiency in some EDS cases for the management of both acute and chronic pain.[123]
 Lidocaine can be applied topically after subluxations and painful gums. It can also be injected into painful areas in the case of musculoskeletal pain.[105]
 If the pain is neuropathic in origin, tricyclic antidepressants in low doses, anticonvulsants, and selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors can be used.[105]
 When a dislocation or subluxation does occur, muscle spasms and stress tend to occur, increasing pain and reducing the chances of the dislocation/subluxation naturally relieving. Methods to support a joint after such an incident include usage of a sling to hold the joint in place and allow it to relax. Orthopedic casts are not advised as there could be pain if unrelaxed muscles are still trying to spasm out against the cast. Other solutions to promote relaxation are heat, gentle massaging, and mental distractions.[124]
 The instability of joints, leading to subluxations and joint pain, often requires surgical intervention in people with EDS. Instability of almost all joints can happen, but appears most often in the lower and upper extremities, with the wrist, fingers, shoulder, knee, hip, and ankle being most common.[116]
 Common surgical procedures are joint debridement, tendon replacements, capsulorrhaphy, and arthroplasty. After surgery, the degree of stabilization, pain reduction, and people's satisfaction can improve, but surgery does not guarantee an optimal result; affected peoples and surgeons report being dissatisfied with the results. The consensus is that conservative treatment is more effective than surgery,[61] particularly since people have extra risks of surgical complications due to the disease. Three basic surgical problems arise due to EDS – the strength of the tissues is decreased, which makes the tissue less suitable for surgery; the fragility of the blood vessels can cause problems during surgery; and wound healing is often delayed or incomplete.[116] If considering surgical intervention, seeking care from a surgeon with extensive knowledge and experience in treating people with EDS and joint hypermobility issues would be prudent.[125]
 Local anesthetics, arterial catheters, and central venous catheters cause a higher risk of bruise formation in people with EDS. Some people with EDS also show a resistance to local anaesthetics.[126] Resistance to lidocaine and bupivacaine is not uncommon, and mepivacaine tends to work better in people with EDS. Special recommendations for anesthesia are given for people with EDS.[citation needed] Detailed recommendations for anesthesia and perioperative care of people with EDS should be used to improve safety.[125]
 Surgery in people with EDS requires careful tissue handling and a longer immobilization afterward.[127]
 The outcome for individuals with EDS depends on the specific type of EDS they have. Symptoms vary in severity, even in the same disorder, and the frequency of complications varies. Some people have negligible symptoms, while others are severely restricted in daily life. Extreme joint instability, chronic musculoskeletal pain, degenerative joint disease, frequent injuries, and spinal deformities may limit mobility. Severe spinal deformities may affect breathing. In the case of extreme joint instability, dislocations may result from simple tasks such as rolling over in bed or turning a doorknob. Secondary conditions such as autonomic dysfunction or cardiovascular problems, occurring in any type, can affect prognosis and quality of life. Severe mobility-related disability is seen more often in hEDS than in classical EDS or vascular EDS.[128]
 Although all types of EDS are potentially life-threatening,[10][11][12] most people have a normal lifespan. Those with blood vessel fragility, though, have a high risk of fatal complications, including spontaneous arterial rupture, which is the most common cause of sudden death. The median life expectancy in the population with vascular EDS is 48 years.[129]
 Ehlers–Danlos syndromes are estimated to occur in about one in 5,000 births worldwide. Initially, prevalence estimates ranged from one in 250,000 to 500,000 people, but these were soon found to be low, as medical professionals became more adept at diagnosis. EDS may be far more common than the currently accepted estimate due to the wide range of severities with which the disorder presents.[131]
 The prevalence of the disorders differs dramatically. The most common is hypermobile EDS, followed by classical EDS. The others are very rare. For example, fewer than 10 infants and children with dermatosparaxis EDS have been described worldwide.
 Some types of EDS are more common in Ashkenazi Jews. For example, the chance of being a carrier for dermatosparaxis EDS is one in 2,000 in the general population but one in 248 among Ashkenazi Jews.[132]
 Until 1997, the classification system for EDS included 10 specific types and acknowledged that other extremely rare types existed. At this time, the classification system underwent an overhaul and was reduced to six major types using descriptive titles. Genetic specialists recognize that other types of this condition exist, but have only been documented in single families. Except for hypermobility (type 3), the most common type of all 10 types, some of the specific variations involved have been identified, and they can be precisely identified by genetic testing; this is valuable due to a great deal of variation in individual cases. Negative genetic test results, though, do not rule out the diagnosis, since not all of the variations have been discovered; therefore, the clinical presentation is very important.[133]
 Forms of EDS in this category may present with soft, mildly stretchable skin, shortened bones, chronic diarrhea, joint hypermobility and dislocation, bladder rupture, or poor wound healing. Inheritance patterns in this group include X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive. Examples of types of related syndromes other than those above reported in the medical literature include:[134]
 EDS may have contributed to the virtuoso violinist Niccolò Paganini's skill, as he was able to play wider fingerings than a typical violinist.[135]
 Many sideshow performers have EDS. Several of them were billed as the Elastic Skin Man, the India Rubber Man, and Frog Boy. They included such well-known individuals (in their time) as Felix Wehrle, James Morris, and Avery Childs. Two performers with EDS currently hold world records. Contortionist Daniel Browning Smith has hypermobile EDS and holds the current Guinness World Record for the most flexible man as of 2018, while Gary ""Stretch"" Turner, sideshow performer in the Circus Of Horrors, has held the current Guinness World Record for the most elastic skin since 1999, for his ability to stretch the skin on his stomach 6.25 inches.[136]
 The fantasy novel Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros presents a main character, Violet Sorrengail, who has an unnamed chronic condition that aligns closely with EDS symptoms. When asked about this connection Rebecca Yarros agrees with the connection but says EDS goes unnamed due to the level of medical knowledge present in her story's world. Yarros has EDS and included it as representation of her condition.[153]
 Grey's Anatomy, a long running TV-series, approached the topic of EDS in their 13th season. In the episode ""Falling Slowly"", the show's doctors are confronted with confusion when met with diagnosing a patient. Due to complex and contradicting symptoms presented by the patient the show's doctors ultimately give the diagnosis of EDS. This episode was based on conversations held by producers who talked with a patient and doctor who have EDS.[154]
 Ehlers–Danlos-like syndromes have been shown to be hereditary in Himalayan cats, some domestic shorthair cats,[155] and certain breeds of cattle.[156] It is seen as a sporadic condition in domestic dogs, with higher frequency in English Springers.[157] It has a similar treatment and prognosis. Animals with the condition should not be bred, as the condition can be inherited.[158]
 Degenerative suspensory ligament desmitis is a similar condition seen in many breeds of horses.[159] It was originally notated in the Peruvian Paso and thought to be a condition of overwork and older age, but it is being recognized in all age groups and all activity levels. It has been noted in newborn foals.

 Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of rare inherited conditions that affect connective tissue. Connective tissues provide support in skin, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, internal organs and bones. There are several types of EDS that may share some symptoms. These include: EDS can affect people in different ways. For some, the condition is relatively mild, while for others their symptoms can be disabling. The different types of EDS are caused by faults in certain genes that make connective tissue weaker. Depending on the type of EDS, the faulty gene may have been inherited from 1 parent or both parents. Sometimes the faulty gene is not inherited, but occurs in the person for the first time. Some of the rare, severe types can be life threatening. There are 13 types of EDS, most of which are rare. Hypermobile EDS (hEDS) is the most common type. Other types of EDS include classical EDS, vascular EDS and kyphoscoliotic EDS. The EDS Support UK website has more information about the different types of EDS People with hEDS may have: Currently, there are no tests to confirm whether someone has hEDS. The diagnosis is made based on a person's medical history and a physical examination. Classical EDS (cEDS) is less common than hypermobile EDS and tends to affect the skin more. People with cEDS may have: Vascular EDS (vEDS) is a rare type of EDS and is often considered to be the most serious. It affects the blood vessels and internal organs, which can cause them to split open and lead to life-threatening bleeding. People with vEDS may have: Kyphoscoliotic EDS (kEDS) is rare. People with kEDS may have: Some people have problems caused by hypermobility, but do not have any of the specific EDS conditions. They may be diagnosed with hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD), which is treated in the same way as hEDS. See a GP if you have several troublesome symptoms of EDS. You do not usually need to worry if you only have a few symptoms and they're not causing any problems. Joint hypermobility, for example, is relatively common, affecting around 1 in 30 people. It's unlikely to be caused by EDS if you do not have any other symptoms. The GP may refer you to a joint specialist (rheumatologist) if you have problems with your joints and they suspect EDS. If there's a possibility you may have 1 of the rare types of EDS, the GP can refer you to your local genetics service for an assessment. The genetics specialist will ask about your medical history, family history, assess your symptoms and may carry out a genetic blood test to confirm the diagnosis. If further investigation is needed, your hospital doctor can refer you to a specialist EDS diagnostic service based in Sheffield or London – see the Annabelle's Challenge website for more information. There's no specific treatment for EDS, but it's possible to manage many of the symptoms with support and advice. People with EDS may also benefit from support from a number of different healthcare professionals. For example: Your GP or consultant can refer you to these services. If you have Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP. To find out if there are any services in your area: It's important to be careful about activities that put a lot of strain on your joints or put you at risk of injury. But it's also important not to be overprotective and avoid living an otherwise normal life. Advice will depend on which type of EDS you have and how it affects you: EDS can be inherited, but it happen by chance in someone without a family history of the condition. The 2 main ways EDS is inherited are: A person with EDS can only pass on the same type of EDS to their children. For example, the children of someone with hypermobile EDS cannot inherit vascular EDS. The severity of the condition can vary within the same family. The following websites provide more information, advice and support for people with EDS and their families: If you have EDS, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service. This helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition. You can opt out of the register at any time.

 Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (/ˌfaɪbroʊdɪˈspleɪʒ(i)ə ɒˈsɪfɪkænz prəˈɡrɛsɪvə/;[1] abbr. FOP),  also called Münchmeyer disease or formerly myositis ossificans progressiva, is an extremely rare connective tissue disease in which fibrous connective tissue such as muscle, tendons, and ligaments turn into bone tissue. It is the only known medical condition where one organ system changes into another.[2] It is a severe, disabling disorder with no cure.
 FOP is caused by a mutation of the gene ACVR1. The mutation affects the body's repair mechanism, causing fibrous tissue including muscle, tendons, and ligaments to become ossified, either spontaneously or when damaged as the result of trauma. In many cases, otherwise minor injuries can cause joints to become permanently fused as new bone forms, replacing the damaged muscle tissue. This new bone formation (known as ""heterotopic ossification"") eventually forms a secondary skeleton and progressively restricts the patient's ability to move. Bone formed as a result of this process is identical to ""normal"" bone, simply in improper locations. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the disease can cause joint degradation separate from its characteristic bone growth.[3]
 Surgical removal of the extra bone growth has been shown to cause the body to ""repair"" the affected area with additional bone. Although the rate of bone growth may differ depending on the patient, the condition ultimately leaves sufferers immobilized as new bone replaces musculature and fuses with the existing skeleton. This has earned FOP the nickname ""stone man disease"".[4]
 For unknown reasons, children born with FOP often have malformed big toes, sometimes missing a joint or, in other cases, simply presenting with a notable lump at the minor joint.[5] The first ""flare-up"" that leads to the formation of FOP bone usually occurs before the age of 10.[5] The bone growth generally progresses from the top of the body downward, just as bones grow in fetuses. A child with FOP will typically develop additional bones starting at the neck, then at the shoulders, arms, chest area, and finally at the feet.[6]
 Specifically, ossification is typically first seen in the dorsal, axial, cranial and proximal regions of the body. Later the disease progresses in the ventral, appendicular, caudal and distal regions.[5] However, it does not necessarily occur in this order due to injury-caused flare-ups. Often, the tumor-like lumps that characterize a flare-up of the disease appear suddenly.
 Bone growth occurring during flare-ups may result in the loss of mobility to affected joints, including, if the jaw/mandible is involved, the inability to fully open the mouth, limiting speech and eating. A specific occurrence of a flare-up of this condition in the foot/ankle joints can result in the limited ability to put a foot flat on the ground.[citation needed] Bone growth can also result in the immobilization of the hip or knee, affecting the individual's ability to walk. Extra bone formation around the rib cage restricts the expansion of lungs and diaphragm causing respiratory complications.[5]
 Since the disorder is incredibly rare, only occurring in 1 out of 2 million people, the condition may be misdiagnosed as cancer or fibrosis. This can lead physicians to order biopsies, potentially exacerbating the growth of FOP bone.[7] The presence of malformed toes or thumbs in those born with FOP help distinguish this disorder from other skeletal problems.[8]
 With proper medical management the median age of survival is 40 years. However, delayed diagnosis, trauma, and infections can decrease life expectancy.[9]
 FOP is caused by an autosomal dominant allele on chromosome 2q23-24.[10] The allele has variable expressivity, but complete penetrance. Most cases are caused by spontaneous mutation in the gametes; most people with FOP cannot or choose not to have children.  A similar but less catastrophic disease is fibrous dysplasia, which is caused by a post-zygotic mutation.
 A mutation in the gene ACVR1 (also known as activin-like kinase 2 (ALK2)) is responsible for the disease.[10] ACVR1 encodes activin receptor type-1, a BMP type-1 receptor. The mutation causes substitution of codon 206 from arginine to histidine in the ACVR1 protein.[11][12] This substitution causes abnormal activation of ACVR1, leading to the transformation of connective tissue and muscle tissue into a secondary skeleton. This causes endothelial cells to transform to mesenchymal stem cells and then to bone.[13] 
Normally, the ACVR1 gene encodes the activin receptor type-1 transmembrane kinase that bind BMP receptors (Type I BMPR and Type II BMPR) for chondrogenesis signaling. BMPs belong to a superfamily of proteins known as Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) proteins. The binding of ACVR1 protein to BMP receptors start a signaling cascade that is crucial for inducing endochondral bone formation during development, as well as, skeletal and tissue homeostasis.[14]
 FOP is an autosomal dominant disorder. Thus, a child of an affected heterozygous parent and an unaffected parent has a 50% probability of being affected. Two affected individuals can produce unaffected children. Two unaffected individuals can produce an affected offspring as a result of the mutation of the gene. The homozygous dominant form is more severe than the heterozygous form.[15]
 The protein that causes ossification is normally deactivated by an inhibitory protein after a fetus's bones are formed in the womb, but in patients with FOP, the protein keeps working. Aberrant bone formation in patients with FOP occurs when injured connective tissue or muscle cells at the sites of injury or growth incorrectly express an enzyme for bone repair during apoptosis (self-regulated cell death), resulting in lymphocytes containing excess bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) provided during the immune system response. The bone that results occurs independently of the normal skeleton, forming its own discrete skeletal elements.  These elements, however, can fuse with normal skeletal bone.[16] The diaphragm, tongue, and extra-ocular muscles are spared in this process, as well as cardiac and smooth muscle.[5] Since the incorrect enzyme remains unresolved within the immune response, the body continues providing the incorrect BMP4-containing lymphocytes. BMP4 is a product that contributes to the development of the skeleton in the normal embryo.[17]
 The ACVR1 gene encodes a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) receptor; this gene is mutated in FOP. It is responsible for growth and development of bone and muscles. The typical mutation, R202H, makes the inhibitor FKBP1A bind less tightly to the activation GS-loop.[18] The result is that ACVR1 is not effectively turned off, and an overgrowth of bone and cartilage and fusion of joints occurs.[19] Atypical mutations involving other residues work similarly. In some cases, the receptor can end up signalling that it's active without being bound to its activating ligand.[20]
 Most of the cases of FOP were results of a new gene mutation: these people had no history of this particular disorder in their family. There are some cases where the individual has inherited the mutation from one affected parent.[19]
 Generally, FOP can be diagnosed with radiographs. Early diagnosis of this disorder through radiology is very important to avoid unnecessary invasive investigations like biopsies. The smallest or trivial trauma or intramuscular injections can amplify progression of the disease through inflammation hence the favorability of radiology. Clinicians should be aware of this rare entity, as it is frequently misdiagnosed as cancer or other benign entities such as infection, resulting in biopsies that can often hasten disease progression.[21]
 Outbreaks may be measurable clinically by elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase.[22] Another telltale sign of FOP is a shortened great toe with a malformed distal first metatarsal and a missing or abnormal first phalanx and/or interphalangeal joint.[23]
 While FOP remains without a cure, a promising breakthrough lies in the approved treatment, Sohonos (palovarotene).[24] Notably, attempts to surgically remove bone in a FOP patient may result in explosive growth of new bone.[25] While undergoing anesthesia, people with FOP may encounter difficulties with intubation, restrictive pulmonary disease, and changes in the electrical conduction system of the heart.[26] Activities that increase the risk of falling or soft tissue injury should be avoided, as even minor trauma may provoke heterotopic ossification.[27]
 Although there are no effective definitive treatments of the disorder, there are intermittent treatments such as anti-inflammatory drugs to suppress inflammation as a result of flare-ups or inflammation from muscle damage. Currently, surgery is not usually recommended for people with FOP as it can incite rapid bone formation at incision sites or where sutures have been applied to muscle or connective tissue. Life-saving surgery may be considered, however developing a surgical plan with input from a FOP specialist may be considered best practice. Surgical release of joint contractures is generally unsuccessful and risks new, trauma-induced heterotopic ossification.[28]
 As of 2017[update], approximately 800 cases of FOP have been confirmed worldwide, making FOP one of the rarest diseases known.[29] The estimated incidence of FOP is 0.5 cases per million people and affects all ethnicities.[29]
 Medical reports describing individuals affected by FOP date back to Dr. Guy Patin in 1692.[29] FOP was originally called myositis ossificans progressiva and was thought to be caused by muscular inflammation (myositis) that caused bone formation.[29] The disease was renamed by Victor A. McKusick in 1970 following the discovery that soft tissue other than muscles (e.g. ligaments) were also affected by the disease process.[29]
 The best known FOP case is that of Harry Eastlack (1933–1973). His condition began to develop at the age of ten, and by the time of his death from pneumonia in November 1973, six days before his 40th birthday, his body had completely ossified, leaving him able to move only his lips. Eastlack never met another person with FOP during his lifetime.[30]
 Eastlack donated his body to science and his skeleton is now at the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia, and has proven to be an invaluable source of information in the study of FOP. Another person with FOP, Carol Orzel (April 20, 1959 – February 2018), also donated her body to the museum and her skeleton was placed on exhibit there, adjacent to Eastlack's, in February 2019.[31][32]
 Clinical trials of isotretinoin, etidronate with oral corticosteroids, and perhexiline maleate have failed to demonstrate effectiveness, though the variable course of the disease and small prevalence induces uncertainty.[22]
 A handful of pharmaceutical companies focused on rare diseases are currently in varying stages of investigation into different therapeutic approaches for FOP.
 In August 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development granted La Jolla Pharmaceuticals orphan drug designation for two novel compounds for FOP. The compounds are small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors designed to selectively block ACVR1 (ALK2).[38]
 In August 2015, Clementia Pharmaceuticals also began the enrollment of children (ages 6 and above) into its Phase II clinical trial investigating palovarotene for the treatment of FOP.[39] Preclinical studies demonstrated that palovarotene, a retinoic acid receptor gamma agonist, blocked abnormal bone formation in animal models by inhibition of secondary messenger systems in the BMP pathway.[40] Clementia licensed palovarotene from Roche Pharmaceuticals, which previously evaluated the compound in more than 800 individuals including healthy volunteers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Palovarotene received Fast Track designation from the FDA and orphan designations for the treatment of FOP from both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).[39]
 In September 2015, Regeneron announced new insight into the mechanism of disease involving the activation of the ACVR1 receptor by activin A. In 2016, the company initiated a phase 1 study of its activin antibody, REGN 2477, in healthy volunteers; a phase 2 trial in FOP patients was conducted in 2017.[41]
 Another potential therapeutic approach involves allele-specific RNA interference that targets mutated mRNA for degradation while preserving normal ACVR1 gene expression.[42]
 Further investigation into the mechanisms of heterotopic bone formation in FOP could aid in the development of treatments for other disorders involving extra-skeletal bone formation.
 Fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) may be the disease-causing cell type responsible for activin A dependent ectopic bone formation in both the muscles and tendons of mice bearing the FOP causing ACVR1(R206H) mutation.[43]
 In December 2019, Ipsen issued a partial clinical hold for people under the age of 14, due to reports of early fusion of growth plates.
 Recently, as of 2021[update], a potential therapeutic candidate, saracatinib, is in phase III clinical trials as a potent heterotopic ossification inhibitor in wild-type and ACVR1 mutant mice.[44]

"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare genetic condition where bone gradually replaces muscles and connective tissues. Injury or illness causes new bone growth, which can be painful and lead to a shortened lifespan. Pronunciation for the genetic condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is “fi-bro-dis-play-see-ah os-sif-eh-cans pro-gres-see-vah.” Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a genetic condition where people are born with bunions and their body’s muscle tissue and connective tissues, like tendons and ligaments, turn into bone on the outside of their skeleton. This condition restricts movement and can cause a loss of mobility over time in people diagnosed with the condition. Symptoms of FOP appear during childhood and usually begin at the neck and shoulders before moving to other areas of the body. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva can affect anyone because it’s most often the result of a new genetic mutation that wasn’t inherited from a parent. Genetic mutations are unpredictable. They occur during fertilization due to an error when cells divide and replicate. Outside factors like smoking and chemical exposure can increase your risk of having a child with a genetic mutation, but if you plan on becoming pregnant, talk to your healthcare provider about genetic testing to assess your risks of having a child with a genetic condition. Advertisement Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is a very rare condition that occurs in an estimated 1 out of every 2 million people worldwide. People diagnosed with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva have a restricted range of motion due to their muscles and connective tissue gradually turning into bone. Signs of the condition start in the neck and shoulders as a child before moving downward to other parts of their body. Any type of trauma to the body can cause a flare-up of the condition. This could be after surgery, a fall or an illness (like the flu). These trigger swelling and inflammation of the muscles (myositis) that lasts for days to months around the affected area. Children may experience difficulty eating (malnutrition) and speaking because irregular bone growth causes the mouth to not open completely. Extra bone growth around the rib cage can restrict how lungs expand and cause breathing difficulties. Advertisement Early cases of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries where physicians first documented their findings. The condition received the name “myositis ossificans progressiva,” which means, “muscle turns progressively to bone,” in the early 1900s. After extensive genetic research by Dr. Victor McKusick of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the condition’s name changed to fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva to better reflect how both soft tissue and muscle turn to bone. In 2006, a research team at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine identified the specific genetic mutation that causes the condition. A mutation of the ACVR1 gene causes fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. The ACVR1 gene gives your body instructions to make type 1 receptors for a protein called bone morphogenic protein (BMP) that reside in your muscles and cartilage. BMP controls how bones and muscles grow and develop. The mutation of ACVR1 causes symptoms of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva because the receptor, like a light switch, is always on when it should turn off. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is an autosomal dominant condition, which means only one biological parent needs to pass the altered gene to the child for them to inherit it. If a parent has the gene that causes fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, there’s a 50% chance that the child will inherit the condition. Most cases of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva occur because of a new mutation of the ACVR1 gene (de novo). This happens randomly, and there’s no link to the gene being present in a person’s family history. The main symptom of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is the gradual replacement of muscles, tendons and ligaments into bone (heterotopic ossification). This process begins at the neck and shoulders in early childhood and progresses throughout the body over time. The development of bone can be rapid in some cases, or very slow in others. Each case is unique. Symptoms arise during flare-ups, which are your body’s reaction to trauma that could be from an injury, surgery or viral illness like the flu. Swelling, or an increase in size or shape of a part of the body, can be painful. When flare-ups occur, the bone morphogenic protein type 1 receptors fail to stop producing proteins, which causes new bone to form on muscles, tendons and ligaments. After new bone forms, swelling decreases, which could take anywhere from a few days to a month. A symptom of the condition that leads to an FOP diagnosis is a malformed and short big toe that sometimes grows inward and over the second toe. Growth differences of the big toes are visible at birth, even before other symptoms appear. Nearly 50% of cases of FOP also have malformations of the thumbs similar to the big toe. Symptoms of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva include: As the condition progresses, people diagnosed with FOP may permanently lose the ability to move. They may experience pain and stiffness caused by bone growths that pinch nerves. At this point in a person’s diagnosis, they may be more susceptible to respiratory infection or heart failure. In severe cases of FOP, people might experience challenges with their cognitive function and ability to learn. Diagnosis of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva begins with a physical examination that identifies the symptoms of the condition, along with reviewing your medical history and performing a genetic test, which is a blood test to identify the gene mutation that causes symptoms. Imaging tests like an X-ray help your healthcare provider examine new bone growth over muscle and connective tissue. Diagnosis of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva can be challenging for healthcare providers. It’s possible to misdiagnose symptoms of FOP as cancer, juvenile fibromatosis (tumors or skin lesions form on soft tissue) or fibrous dysplasia. This occurs because FOP is extremely rare and very few healthcare providers encounter it during their careers. A biopsy of an FOP tumor — when your healthcare provider removes a small portion of the tumor to examine the cells under a microscope — often looks similar to a cancerous tumor. If your healthcare provider suspects an FOP diagnosis, they won’t perform a diagnostic biopsy because the procedure can cause severe bone growth flare-ups. The most important symptoms that lead to an FOP diagnosis are malformed big toes and soft tissue swelling that forms throughout the body. Treatment for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva aims to reduce symptoms, especially flare-ups that ignite the bone-growing process. There’s no cure for FOP but research and clinical trials are progressing to help people diagnosed with the condition. Treatment is unique for each person to address their specific symptoms. Treatment for FOP could include: Preventing symptoms of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva involves avoiding trauma to your muscles and tissues. Symptoms flare up when you experience an event that causes stress to your body, like surgery, an injury or an illness. You can reduce your risk of having flare-ups of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva symptoms by: You can’t prevent fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva from occurring because it’s the result of a genetic mutation. To understand the risks of having a child with a genetic condition, talk with your healthcare provider about genetic testing. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is a lifelong condition with no cure. The prognosis (outlook) is poor due to severe symptoms of the condition, including respiratory infections and restricted mobility that becomes worse over time. Life expectancy for someone diagnosed with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is reduced into early adulthood. Most people are completely immobile by age 30. The most common cause of death among people with an FOP diagnosis is a respiratory infection. Research and clinical trials for new treatment options are in progress to help reduce symptoms and prolong the life of people diagnosed with the condition. After a fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva diagnosis, work closely with your healthcare provider to find a treatment plan that’s unique to you and your symptoms. A genetic counselor can help you understand the diagnosis and provide emotional support for you and your family. Flare-ups of the condition may cause pain and discomfort, but your healthcare provider will offer options to ease symptoms. You should visit your healthcare provider if: If you have trouble breathing, contact 911 or visit the emergency room immediately. A note from Cleveland Clinic After receiving a rare genetic diagnosis, you may be asking yourself, “What do I do next?” Your healthcare provider will monitor your health regularly and offer additional support. They may recommend you see a genetic counselor or an occupational therapist to help you better understand your diagnosis, minimize flare-ups and ultimately lead a comfortable life. Clinical trials and research are progressing to offer additional support to people diagnosed with the condition. Last reviewed on 11/29/2022. Learn more about our editorial process.

"Friedreich ataxia (FA) is a rare, inherited disorder that causes progressive damage to the nervous system. This can cause movement and sensory symptoms and trouble with walking and gait. In FA, nerve fibers in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves break down, becoming thinner. In the brain, the cerebellum, part of the brain that coordinates balance and movement, is most affected.  FA affects a person’s peripheral nerves, which carry information back and forth from the brain to the body using sensory and motor signals. This is why a person with FA develops motor weakness and sensory loss. Symptoms typically begin between the ages of five and 15, although they sometimes appear after age 25. Symptoms of FA may include: FA also may cause heart disease, specifically cardiomyopathy (a disease of cardiac muscle that may lead to heart failure or heart rhythm irregularities), and diabetes.  Progression of FA varies from person to person. Generally, within 10 to 20 years after the appearance of the first symptoms, individuals with FA may need to use a wheelchair. In later stages of the disorder, people may become completely incapacitated. There is no cure for the disorder, and heart disease is the most common cause of death in people with FA. However, some people with less severe FA live into their sixties or older. Although rare, Friedreich ataxia is the most common form of hereditary ataxia in the United States.  Friedreich ataxia is caused by a defect (mutation) in a gene labeled FXN, which carries the genetic code for the production of a protein called frataxin. Frataxin is necessary for the proper function of the energy-producing part of a cell (called the mitochondria).  In FA, an abnormal pattern in the DNA sequence of the protein (called a GAA triplet repeat) appears hundreds or more times, which greatly disrupts the normal production of frataxin. Research suggests that without a normal level of frataxin, certain cells in the body (especially peripheral nerve, spinal cord, brain, and heart muscle cells) produce energy less effectively and may have a buildup of toxic byproducts leading to what is called “oxidative stress.” Lack of normal levels of frataxin also may lead to increased levels of iron in the mitochondria. When the excess iron reacts with oxygen, free radicals can be produced. Although free radicals are essential molecules in the body metabolism, they can also destroy cells and harm the body. Individuals who inherit two defective copies of the FXN gene, one from each parent, will develop the disease. A person who inherits only one abnormal copy of the gene is called a carrier. A carrier will not develop the disease but could pass the gene mutation on to his or her children. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance. Genetic testing can determine if a person is a carrier of FA and whether they will pass FA along to any future children.  Genetic testing can provide a conclusive diagnosis of FA. A diagnosis of FA should also include a medical history and a thorough physical exam by a clinician. The healthcare provider will look for difficulty with balance, loss of sensation, absence of reflexes, and signs of other neurological problems. Other tests that may aid in the diagnosis or management of the disorder include: Doctors measure the progression of FA using tools called FARS (Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale), mFARS (modified FARS) or SARA (Scale for Assessment and Rate of Ataxia) to measure neurological function and severity of a person’s symptoms over time.  In 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first medication, called omaveloxolone, to treat FA in individuals 16 years of age or older. There is currently no cure for FA. However, many of the symptoms and accompanying complications can be treated or managed to help people maintain function and daily activities as long as possible.  People with FA should be treated by a multidisciplinary team of professionals that can support medical treatment as well as functional support through physical therapy. Doctors can prescribe treatments for diabetes, if present; some of the heart problems can be treated with medication as well. Orthopedic problems such as foot deformities and scoliosis can be corrected with braces or surgery. Physical therapy may help the person maintain function of their arms and legs for longer. Speech and language therapists can help with supports for swallowing and speech issues and closely monitor of these symptoms. Hearing aids can help with FA-associated hearing loss.  NINDS is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the leading supporter of biomedical research in the world. The range of NIH-funded research on FA includes determining how the gene mutation affects nerve functions, gaining a better understanding of frataxin, investigating ways to override or prevent the activation of genetic mutation, and developing treatments for the disease. In addition to NINDS, several other NIH institutes and centers support FA research. Researchers hope to find a way to silence the abnormal FXN gene and restore normal gene function. One approach is using stem cell lines that have been turned into nerve cells for experiments to study gene expression changes and its effect on the cells in response to modification to FXN gene.  Other research efforts include seeking a better understanding of the mitochondrial defects associated with the disease, developing new animal models of FA that closely mimic the gene mutations found in people, and developing biomarkers (biological signals that can indicate disease or disease progression) for future clinical trials. More information about Friedreich ataxia research can be found using NIH RePORTER, a searchable database of current and past research projects supported by NIH and other federal agencies. RePORTER also includes links to publications and resources from these projects. For research articles and summaries on FA, search PubMed, which contains citations from medical journals and other sites. Consider participating in a clinical trial so clinicians and scientists can learn more about Friedreich ataxia. Clinical research uses human study participants to help researchers learn more about a disorder and perhaps find better ways to safely diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. All types of participants are needed—those who are healthy or may have an illness or disease—of all different ages, sexes, races, and ethnicities to ensure that study results apply to as many people as possible, and that treatments will be safe and effective for everyone who will use them.

 Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA or FA) is an autosomal-recessive genetic disease that causes difficulty walking, a loss of coordination in the arms and legs, and impaired speech that worsens over time. Symptoms generally start between 5 and 20 years of age. Many develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and require a mobility aid such as a cane, walker, or wheelchair in their teens.   As the disease progresses, some affected people lose their sight and hearing. Other complications may include scoliosis and diabetes.
 The condition is caused by mutations in the FXN gene on chromosome 9, which makes a protein called frataxin. In FRDA, cells produce less frataxin. Degeneration of nerve tissue in the spinal cord causes the ataxia; particularly affected are the sensory neurons essential for directing muscle movement of the arms and legs through connections with the cerebellum. The spinal cord becomes thinner, and nerve cells lose some myelin sheath.
 In February 2023, the first approval of a treatment for FRDA, omaveloxolone, was granted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Approval in the European Union was granted in February 2024.
 FRDA affects one in 50,000 people in the United States and is the most common inherited ataxia.[not verified in body] Rates are highest in people of Western European descent.[not verified in body] The condition is named after German physician Nikolaus Friedreich, who first described it in the 1860s.
 Symptoms typically start between the ages of 5 and 15, but in late-onset FRDA, they may occur after age 25 years.[1]  The symptoms are broad, but consistently involve gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria and loss of lower limb reflexes.[1]
 There is some variability in symptom frequency, onset and progression. All individuals with FRDA develop neurological symptoms, including dysarthria and loss of lower limb reflexes, and more than 90% present with ataxia.[1] Cardiac issues are very common with early onset FRDA .[1] Most individuals develop heart problems such as enlargement of the heart, symmetrical hypertrophy, heart murmurs, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and conduction defects. Scoliosis is present in about 60%. 7% of people with FRDA also have diabetes and having diabetes has an adverse impact on people with FA, especially those that show symptoms when young.[2][3]
 People who have been living with FRDA for a long time may develop other complications. 36.8% experience decreased visual acuity, which may be progressive and could lead to functional blindness.[3]  Hearing loss is present in about 10.9% of cases.[3]  Some patients report bladder and bowel symptoms.[4] Advanced stages of disease are associated with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, most commonly atrial fibrillation.[1]
 Other later stage symptoms can include, cerebellar effects such as nystagmus, fast saccadic eye movements, dysmetria and loss of coordination (truncal ataxia, and stomping gait).[1] Symptoms can involve the dorsal column such as the loss of vibratory sensation and proprioceptive sensation.[1]
 The progressive loss of coordination and muscle strength leads to the full-time use of a wheelchair.  Most young people diagnosed with FRDA require mobility aids such as a cane, walker, or wheelchair by early 20s.[5]
The disease is progressive, with increasing staggering or stumbling gait and frequent falling.  By the third decade, affected people lose the ability to stand or walk without assistance and require a wheelchair for mobility.[6]
 Non-neurological symptoms such as scoliosis, pes cavus, cardiomyopathy and diabetes are more frequent amongst the early-onset cases.[1]
 FRDA is an autosomal-recessive disorder that affects a gene (FXN) on chromosome 9, which produces an important protein called frataxin.[7]
 In 96% of cases, the mutant FXN gene has 90–1,300 GAA trinucleotide repeat expansions in intron 1 of both alleles.[8] This expansion causes epigenetic changes and formation of heterochromatin near the repeat.[7] The length of the shorter GAA repeat is correlated with the age of onset and disease severity.[9] The formation of heterochromatin results in reduced transcription of the gene and low levels of frataxin.[10] People with FDRA might have 5-35% of the frataxin protein compared to healthy individuals. Heterozygous carriers of the mutant FXN gene have 50% lower frataxin levels, but this decrease is not enough to cause symptoms.[11]
 In about 4% of cases, the disease is caused by a (missense, nonsense, or intronic) point mutation, with an expansion in one allele and a point mutation in the other.[12] A missense point mutation can have milder symptoms.[12] Depending on the point mutation, cells can produce no frataxin, nonfunctional frataxin, or frataxin that is not properly localized to the mitochondria.[13][14]
 FRDA affects the nervous system, heart, pancreas, and other systems.[15][16]
 Degeneration of nerve tissue in the spinal cord causes ataxia.[15] The sensory neurons essential for directing muscle movement of the arms and legs through connections with the cerebellum are particularly affected.[15] The disease primarily affects the spinal cord and peripheral nerves.[medical citation needed]
 The spinal cord becomes thinner and nerve cells lose some myelin sheath.[15] The diameter of the spinal cord is smaller than that of unaffected individuals mainly due to smaller dorsal root ganglia.[16] The motor neurons of the spinal cord are affected to a lesser extent than sensory neurons.[15] In peripheral nerves, a loss of large myelinated sensory fibers occurs.[15]
 Structures in the brain are also affected by FRDA, notably the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum.[16] The heart often develops some fibrosis, and over time, develops left-ventricle hypertrophy and dilatation of the left ventricle.[16]
 The exact role of frataxin remains unclear.[17] Frataxin assists iron-sulfur protein synthesis in the electron transport chain to generate adenosine triphosphate, the energy molecule necessary to carry out metabolic functions in cells. It also regulates iron transfer in the mitochondria by providing a proper amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to maintain normal processes.[18] One result of frataxin deficiency is mitochondrial iron overload, which damages many proteins due to effects on cellular metabolism.[19]
 Without frataxin, the energy in the mitochondria falls, and excess iron creates extra ROS, leading to further cell damage.[18] Low frataxin levels lead to insufficient biosynthesis of iron–sulfur clusters that are required for mitochondrial electron transport and assembly of functional aconitase and iron dysmetabolism of the entire cell.[19]
 Balance difficulty, loss of proprioception, an absence of reflexes, and signs of other neurological problems are common signs from a physical examination.[6][20] Diagnostic tests are made to confirm a physical examination such as electromyogram, nerve conduction studies, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, blood tests for elevated glucose levels and vitamin E levels, and scans such as X-ray radiograph for scoliosis.[21] MRI and CT scans of brain and spinal cord are done to rule out other neurological conditions.[22] Finally, a genetic test is conducted to confirm.[22]
 Other diagnoses might include Charcot-Marie-Tooth types 1 and 2, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, ataxia-oculomotor apraxia types 1 and 2,  and other early-onset ataxias.[23]
 Physicians and patients can reference the clinical management guidelines for Friedreich ataxia.[24] These Guidelines are intended to assist qualified healthcare professionals in making informed treatment decisions about the care of individuals with Friedreich ataxia.[25]
 
 Omaveloxolone, sold under the brand name Skyclarys, is a medication used for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia.[26][27] It is taken by mouth.[26]
 The most common side effects include an increase in alanine transaminase and an increase of aspartate aminotransferase, which can be signs of liver damage, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, diarrhea and musculoskeletal pain.[27]
 Physical therapists play a critical role in educating on correct posture, muscle use, and the identification and avoidance of features that aggravate spasticities such as tight clothing, poorly adjusted wheelchairs, pain, and infection.[33]
 Physical therapy typically includes intensive motor coordination, balance, and stabilization training to preserve gains.[34]  Low-intensity strengthening exercises are incorporated to maintain functional use of the upper and lower extremities.[34]  Stretching and muscle relaxation exercises can be prescribed to help manage spasticity and prevent deformities.[34] Other physical therapy goals include increased transfer and locomotion independence, muscle strengthening, increased physical resilience, ""safe fall"" strategy, learning to use mobility aids, learning how to reduce the body's energy expenditure, and developing specific breathing patterns.[34]  Speech therapy can improve voice quality.[35]
 Well-fitted orthoses can promote correct posture, support normal joint alignment, stabilize joints during walking, improve range of motion and gait, reduce spasticity, and prevent foot deformities and scoliosis.[5]
 Functional electrical stimulation or transcutaneous nerve stimulation devices may alleviate symptoms.[5]
 As progression of ataxia continues, assistive devices such as a cane, walker, or wheelchair may be required for mobility and independence. A standing frame can help reduce the secondary complications of prolonged use of a wheelchair.[36][37]
 Cardiac abnormalities can be controlled with ACE inhibitors such as enalapril, ramipril, lisinopril, or trandolapril, sometimes used in conjunction with beta blockers. Affected people who also have symptomatic congestive heart failure may be prescribed eplerenone or digoxin to keep cardiac abnormalities under control.[5]
 Surgery may correct deformities caused by abnormal muscle tone. Titanium screws and rods inserted in the spine help prevent or slow the progression of scoliosis. Surgery to lengthen the Achilles tendon can improve independence and mobility to alleviate equinus deformity.[5] An automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator can be implanted after a severe heart failure.[5]
 The disease evolves differently in different people.[36] In general, those diagnosed at a younger age or with longer GAA triplet expansions tend to have more severe symptoms.[5]
 Congestive heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms are the leading causes of death,[38] but people with fewer symptoms can live into their 60s or older.[22]
 FRDA affects Indo-European populations. It is rare in East Asians, sub-Saharan Africans, and Native Americans. FRDA is the most prevalent inherited ataxia, affecting approximately 1 in 40,000 with European descent.[15] Males and females are affected equally. The estimated carrier prevalence is 1:100.[5] A 1990–1996 study of Europeans calculated the incidence rate was 2.8:100,000.[39] The prevalence rate of FRDA in Japan is 1:1,000,000.[40]
 FRDA follows the same pattern as haplogroup R1b. Haplogroup R1b is the most frequently occurring paternal lineage in Western Europe. FRDA and Haplogroup R1b are more common in northern Spain, Ireland, and France, rare in Russia and Scandinavia, and follow a gradient through central and eastern Europe. A population carrying the disease went through a population bottleneck in the Franco-Cantabrian region during the last ice age.[41]
 The condition is named after the 1860s German pathologist and neurologist, Nikolaus Friedreich.[42] Friedreich reported the disease in 1863 at the University of Heidelberg.[43][44][45] Further observations appeared in a paper in 1876.[46]
 Frantz Fanon wrote his medical thesis on FRDA, in 1951.[47]
 A 1984 Canadian study traced 40 cases to one common ancestral couple arriving in New France in 1634.[48]
 FRDA was first linked to a GAA repeat expansion on chromosome 9 in 1996.[49]
 The Cake Eaters is a 2007 independent drama film that stars Kristen Stewart as a young woman with FRDA.[50]
 The Ataxian is a documentary that tells the story of Kyle Bryant, an athlete with FRDA who completes a long-distance bike race in an adaptive ""trike"" to raise money for research.[51]
 Dynah Haubert spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention about supporting Americans with disabilities.[52]
 Geraint Williams in an athlete affected by FRDA who is known for scaling Mount Kilimanjaro in an adaptive wheelchair.[53]
 Shobhika Kalra is an activist with FRDA who helped build over 1000 wheelchair ramps across the United Arab Emirates in 2018 to try to  make Dubai fully wheelchair-friendly by 2020.[54]
 Butterflies Still Fly is a 2023 film, based on a true story, directed by Joseph Nenci. Italo is a light-hearted journalist, darkened by a personal drama that distracts him from work. He encounters with Giorgia, a young girl suffering from Friedreich's Ataxia, who will change his life.
 There is no cure for Friedreich's ataxia, and treatment development is directed toward slowing, stopping, or reversing disease progression.
In 2019, Reata Pharmaceuticals reported positive results in a phase 2 trial of RTA 408 (Omaveloxolone or Omav) to target activation of a transcriptional factor, Nrf2.[55] Nrf2 is decreased in FRDA cells.[56][57][58][59]
 There are several additional therapies in trial. Patients can enroll in a registry to make clinical trial recruiting easier. The Friedreich's Ataxia Global Patient Registry is the only worldwide registry of Friedreich's ataxia patients to characterize the symptoms and establish the rate of disease progression.[60]  The Friedreich's Ataxia App is the only global community app which enables novel forms of research.[61]
 As of May 2021, research continues along the following paths.

"Friedreich’s ataxia (FA) is a rare inherited condition that damages your nervous system, which causes muscle weakness, balance issues and sensory deficits that worsen over time. Symptoms most often begin in childhood but can also begin in adulthood. 
There currently isn’t a cure for FA, but treatment involves managing symptoms and complications of the condition. Friedreich’s ataxia (also called FA or FDRA) is a rare genetic condition that causes progressive nervous system damage and movement issues. It usually begins in childhood and leads to impaired muscle coordination (ataxia) that becomes worse over time. It’s a degenerative disease. Friedreich’s ataxia also often leads to: This condition doesn’t affect thinking and reasoning abilities (cognitive functions). About 25% of people with Friedreich’s ataxia develop symptoms after the age of 25. This is considered late-onset Friedreich’s ataxia (LOFA). When signs and symptoms start after age 40, it’s called very late-onset Friedreich’s ataxia (VLOFA). LOFA and VLOFA usually progress more slowly than typical FA. Friedreich’s ataxia is named after Nikolaus Friedreich, a pathologist who first described the condition in 1863. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy A genetic mutation causes Friedreich’s ataxia. Anyone can inherit the condition if both of their biological parents carry a copy of the FXN gene mutation and pass that on to their child. The first symptoms of Friedreich’s ataxia usually begin in childhood and progress throughout your life, though people can first develop symptoms as an adult. It affects people assigned female at birth (AFAB) and children assigned male at birth (AMAB) equally. Friedreich’s ataxia most commonly affects people with the following ancestries: While FA is the most common form of hereditary ataxia, it’s generally rare. FA affects approximately 1 in every 50,000 people in the United States. Globally, it affects 1 in every 40,000 people. Advertisement Friedreich’s ataxia is a genetic (inherited) condition that results in a deficiency of an essential protein called frataxin. This deficiency can affect several aspects of your child’s body, including their: It’s important to remember that FA affects everyone differently and at different rates of progression. A deficiency of frataxin causes nerve fibers in your child’s spinal cord and peripheral nerves to degenerate (become damaged). Your peripheral nervous system consists of nerves that carry information from different areas of your body back to your brain, like a message that your hand is warm. It also carries commands from your brain to various parts of your body, like a message to your muscles to move your legs. Your cerebellum, the part of your brain that coordinates balance and movement, also degenerates in Friedreich’s ataxia, but usually to a lesser extent. This damage results in unsteady movements and impaired sensory functions. Due to this nerve degeneration, people with FA experience a gradual loss of strength and sensation in their arms and legs; difficulty with balance; and impaired speech, hearing and vision. People with FA typically require mobility aids, such as a wheelchair, about 10 years after signs and symptoms first appear. Advertisement A lack of frataxin causes issues with the muscles and nerves in your heart, which can cause several different heart conditions. Approximately 75% of people with FA develop heart issues — most commonly, cardiac neuropathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and irregular heartbeat. Other cardiac complications that can result from FA include: Certain skeletal issues are common in people with FA. These typically happen because some of your child’s muscles have weakened while others have remained strong, pulling your child’s bones into abnormal positions. About two-thirds of people with FA develop scoliosis (curvature of their spine), which can be painful and interfere with breathing by changing the shape of your child’s chest cavity. Many people with FA experience inversion (inward turning) of their feet, and a little over half have pes cavus (a shortened foot with a high arch). FA can cause damage to the cells in your pancreas that make the hormone insulin, which is essential for maintaining healthy blood glucose (sugar) levels. Without adequate amounts of insulin, your blood sugar levels increase, resulting in hyperglycemia, which can lead to diabetes. Approximately 30% of people with FA develop diabetes. Friedreich’s ataxia affects everyone differently and progresses at different speeds. Heart disease, specifically hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart muscle), is the most common cause of death in people with FA. Some people with more severe forms of FA die from the condition by early adulthood, while others with more mild forms of FA live into their 60s or beyond. Symptoms of Friedreich’s ataxia usually begin between the ages of 5 and 15, but some people with FA have experienced symptoms starting as young as 2 years old and as old as 50. The first neurological symptom to appear is usually difficulty standing and walking and poor balance (gait ataxia). Over time, the existing symptoms progressively worsen and new symptoms can develop. FA’s major neurological symptoms include: These symptoms can present as: A mutation (error) in the FXN gene, which carries the genetic code for an essential protein called frataxin, causes Friedreich’s ataxia. Frataxin is a protein that’s found in the energy-producing parts of the cells in your body called mitochondria. Although scientists don’t fully understand its role, frataxin is important for the normal function of mitochondria. The gene mutation that causes FA greatly disrupts the normal production of frataxin. Without a normal level of frataxin, certain cells in your body, especially cells in your peripheral nerves, spinal cord, brain and heart muscle, produce energy less effectively and create a buildup of toxic byproducts. This damages your cells. People who inherit two mutated copies of this gene, one from each biological parent, will develop Friedreich’s ataxia. This is known as an autosomal recessive pattern. The biological parents of a person with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically don’t show signs and symptoms of the condition. Diagnosis of Friedreich’s ataxia begins with a careful clinical examination that includes a medical history and a thorough physical and neurological exam. During the physical exam, your child’s healthcare provider will look for: Your child’s healthcare provider will then order genetic testing, which can confirm the diagnosis. They may order additional tests to aid in the diagnosis. Genetic testing is the main test that can confirm Friedreich’s ataxia. Your child’s healthcare provider may order other tests to help in the diagnosis and/or to assess areas of their body that may be affected by FA. These tests include: As with many degenerative diseases of the nervous system, there’s currently no effective treatment for Friedreich’s ataxia. The main goal of therapy is to treat the symptoms and complications caused by FA to maintain optimal functioning for as long as possible. This kind of therapy may include: Friedreich’s ataxia affects everyone differently and at different rates. Your child’s healthcare team will develop an individualized plan for therapy that will change and adapt as your child grows. If you or your child have Friedreich’s ataxia, you’ll have a team of healthcare specialists to help manage the condition. These specialists may include: As Friedreich’s ataxia is the result of a genetic mutation inherited from both biological parents, there’s no way to prevent it from occurring. If you plan on having a biological child, talk with your healthcare provider about genetic testing to understand your risk of having a child with a genetic condition like Friedrich’s ataxia. It’s important to remember that no two people with Friedreich’s ataxia are affected in the same way. It’s impossible to predict with certainty how you or your child will be affected. The best way you can prepare for the future is to talk to healthcare providers who specialize in researching and treating Friedreich’s ataxia. As Friedreich’s ataxia is a degenerative condition and worsens over time, people with FA tend to have a shorter life expectancy than the average population. FA affects everyone differently. Many people with FA live until at least their 30s, and some can live into their 60s or beyond. If you have Friedreich’s ataxia, it’s essential to ensure you’re getting quality medical care to prevent or treat complications of FA, such as heart disease or diabetes. You may also want to consider joining a support group to meet others who can relate to your experiences. If you’re taking care of someone with FA, it’s important to advocate for them to ensure they get the best medical care and access to mobility devices and therapy that can help them be more independent. If you or your child have been diagnosed with Friedreich’s ataxia, you’ll need to see your team of healthcare providers regularly to receive treatment and monitor symptoms. A note from Cleveland Clinic Understanding your or your child’s Friedreich’s ataxia (FA) diagnosis can be overwhelming. Your healthcare team will offer a robust treatment plan that’s unique to you or your child’s symptoms. It’s important to make sure you or your child are getting the love and support you/they need throughout your/their life and stay attentive to your/their health to address any new symptoms that arise.

"Viral gastroenteritis is an intestinal infection that includes signs and symptoms such as watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea or vomiting, and sometimes fever. The most common way to develop viral gastroenteritis — often called stomach flu — is through contact with an infected person or by consuming contaminated food or water. If you're otherwise healthy, you'll likely recover without complications. But for infants, older adults and people with compromised immune systems, viral gastroenteritis can be deadly. There's no effective treatment for viral gastroenteritis, so prevention is key. Avoid food and water that may be contaminated and wash your hands thoroughly and often. Although it's commonly called stomach flu, gastroenteritis isn't the same as influenza. The flu (influenza) affects only your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs. Gastroenteritis, on the other hand, attacks your intestines, causing signs and symptoms such as: Depending on the cause, viral gastroenteritis symptoms may appear within 1-3 days after you're infected and can range from mild to severe. Symptoms usually last just a day or two, but occasionally they may last up to 14 days. Because the symptoms are similar, it's easy to confuse viral diarrhea with diarrhea caused by bacteria, such as Clostridioides difficile, salmonella and Escherichia coli, or parasites, such as giardia. 
        The stomach, small intestine and large intestine (colon) are part of your digestive tract, which processes the foods you eat. Viral gastroenteritis is an inflammation of these organs caused by a virus.
         If you're an adult, call your health care provider if: See your child's health care provider right away if your child: If you have an infant, remember that while spitting up may be an everyday occurrence for your baby, vomiting is not. Babies vomit for a variety of reasons, many of which may require medical attention. Call your baby's doctor right away if your baby: You're most likely to get viral gastroenteritis when you eat or drink contaminated food or water. You may also be likely to get gastroenteritis if you share utensils, towels or food with someone who has one of the viruses that cause the condition. Many viruses can cause gastroenteritis, including: Noroviruses. Both children and adults are affected by noroviruses, the most common cause of foodborne illness worldwide. Norovirus infection can sweep through families and communities. It's especially likely to spread among people in confined spaces. In most cases, you pick up the virus from contaminated food or water. But it can also spread between people who are in close contact or who share food. You can also get the virus by touching a surface that's been contaminated with norovirus and then touching your mouth. Rotavirus. Worldwide, this is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children, who are usually infected when they put their fingers or other objects contaminated with the virus into their mouths. It can also spread through contaminated food. The infection is most severe in infants and young children. Adults infected with rotavirus may not have symptoms, but can still spread the illness. This is of particular concern in institutional settings such as nursing homes because adults with the virus unknowingly can pass the virus to others. A vaccine against viral gastroenteritis is available in some countries, including the United States, and appears to be effective in preventing the infection. Some shellfish, especially raw or undercooked oysters, also can make you sick. Contaminated drinking water is a cause of viral diarrhea. But in many cases the virus is passed when someone with a virus handles food you eat without washing his or her hands after using the toilet. Gastroenteritis occurs all over the world and can affect people of all ages. People who may be more susceptible to gastroenteritis include: Each gastrointestinal virus has a season when it's most active. If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, for instance, you're more likely to have rotavirus or norovirus infections in the winter and spring. The main complication of viral gastroenteritis is dehydration — a severe loss of water and essential salts and minerals. If you're healthy and drink enough to replace fluids you lose from vomiting and diarrhea, dehydration shouldn't be a problem. Infants, older adults and people with weakened immune systems may become severely dehydrated when they lose more fluids than they can replace. Hospitalization might be needed so that lost fluids can be replaced through an IV in their arms. Dehydration can rarely lead to death. The best way to prevent the spread of intestinal infections is to follow these precautions: Wash your hands thoroughly. And make sure your children do, too. If your children are older, teach them to wash their hands, especially after using the toilet. Wash your hands after changing diapers and before preparing or eating food, too. It's best to use warm water and soap and to rub hands well for at least 20 seconds. Wash around cuticles, beneath fingernails and in the creases of the hands. Then rinse thoroughly. Carry sanitizing wipes and hand sanitizer for times when soap and water aren't available. When you're traveling in other countries, you can become sick from contaminated food or water.

 Gastroenteritis, also known as infectious diarrhea, is an inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract including the stomach and intestine.[8] Symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.[1] Fever, lack of energy, and dehydration may also occur.[2][3] This typically lasts less than two weeks.[8] Although it is not related to influenza, in the U.S. and U.K., it is sometimes called the ""stomach flu"".[9]
 Gastroenteritis is usually caused by viruses;[4] however, gut bacteria, parasites, and fungi can also cause gastroenteritis.[2][4] In children, rotavirus is the most common cause of severe disease.[10] In adults, norovirus and Campylobacter are common causes.[11][12] Eating improperly prepared food, drinking contaminated water or close contact with a person who is infected can spread the disease.[2] Treatment is generally the same with or without a definitive diagnosis, so testing to confirm is usually not needed.[2]
 For young children in impoverished countries, prevention includes hand washing with soap, drinking clean water, breastfeeding babies instead of using formula,[2] and proper disposal of human waste. The rotavirus vaccine is recommended as a prevention for children.[2][10] Treatment involves getting enough fluids.[2] For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution (a combination of water, salts and sugar).[2] In those who are breastfed, continued breastfeeding is recommended.[2] For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed.[2] Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube.[13] Zinc supplementation is recommended in children.[2] Antibiotics are generally not needed.[14] However, antibiotics are recommended for young children with a fever and bloody diarrhea.[1]
 In 2015, there were two billion cases of gastroenteritis, resulting in 1.3 million deaths globally.[6][7] Children and those in the developing world are affected the most.[15] In 2011, there were about 1.7 billion cases, resulting in about 700,000 deaths of children under the age of five.[16] In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year.[17] It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of immunity.[18]
 Gastroenteritis usually involves both diarrhea and vomiting.[18] Sometimes, only one or the other is present.[1] This may be accompanied by abdominal cramps.[1] Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72 hours after contracting the infectious agent.[15] If due to a virus, the condition usually resolves within one week.[18] Some viral infections also involve fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain.[18] If the stool is bloody, the cause is less likely to be viral[18] and more likely to be bacterial.[19] Some bacterial infections cause severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.[19]
 Children infected with rotavirus usually make a full recovery within three to eight days.[20] However, in poor countries treatment for severe infections is often out of reach and persistent diarrhea is common.[21] Dehydration is a common complication of diarrhea.[22] Severe dehydration in children may be recognized if the skin color and position returns slowly when pressed.[23] This is called ""prolonged capillary refill"" and ""poor skin turgor"".[23] Abnormal breathing is another sign of severe dehydration.[23] Repeat infections are typically seen in areas with poor sanitation, and malnutrition.[15] Stunted growth and long-term cognitive delays can result.[17]
 Reactive arthritis occurs in 1% of people following infections with Campylobacter species.[19] Guillain–Barré syndrome occurs in 0.1%.[19] Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) may occur due to infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or Shigella species.[24] HUS causes low platelet counts, poor kidney function, and low red blood cell count (due to their breakdown).[24] Children are more predisposed to getting HUS than adults.[17] Some viral infections may produce benign infantile seizures.[1]
 Viruses (particularly rotavirus (in children) and norovirus (in adults)) and the bacteria Escherichia coli and Campylobacter species are the primary causes of gastroenteritis.[15][25] There are, however, many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome including parasites and fungus.[17][4] Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but they are less likely than a viral or bacterial cause.[1] Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity.[1] Children are also at higher risk because they are less likely to practice good hygiene habits.[1] Children living in areas without easy access to water and soap are especially vulnerable.[1]
 Rotaviruses, noroviruses, adenoviruses, and astroviruses are known to cause viral gastroenteritis.[26] Rotavirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in children,[25] and produces similar rates in both the developed and developing world.[20] Viruses cause about 70% of episodes of infectious diarrhea in the pediatric age group.[13] Rotavirus is a less common cause in adults due to acquired immunity.[27] Norovirus is the cause in about 18% of all cases.[28] Generally speaking, viral gastroenteritis accounts for 21–40% of the cases of infectious diarrhea in developed countries.[29]
 Norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis among adults in America accounting for about 90% of viral gastroenteritis outbreaks.[18] These localized epidemics typically occur when groups of people spend time proximate to each other, such as on cruise ships,[18] in hospitals, or in restaurants.[1] People may remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended.[18] Norovirus is the cause of about 10% of cases in children.[1]
 In some countries, Campylobacter jejuni is the primary cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry.[19] In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species.[13] If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for a period of several hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food.[17] Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and fruit and vegetable juices.[30] In the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, cholera is a common cause of gastroenteritis. This infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food.[31]
 Toxigenic Clostridium difficile is an important cause of diarrhea that occurs more often in the elderly.[17] Infants can carry these bacteria without developing symptoms.[17] It is a common cause of diarrhea in those who are hospitalized and is frequently associated with antibiotic use.[32] Staphylococcus aureus infectious diarrhea may also occur in those who have used antibiotics.[33] Acute ""traveler's diarrhea"" is usually a type of bacterial gastroenteritis, while the persistent form is usually parasitic.[34] Acid-suppressing medication appears to increase the risk of significant infection after exposure to a number of organisms, including Clostridium difficile, Salmonella, and Campylobacter species.[35] The risk is greater in those taking proton pump inhibitors than with H2 antagonists.[35]
 A number of parasites can cause gastroenteritis.[13] Giardia lamblia is most common, but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., and other species have also been implicated.[13][34] As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children.[24][34] Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this type of illness can occur nearly everywhere.[36] It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, men who have sex with men, and following disasters.[36]
 Transmission may occur from drinking contaminated water or when people share personal objects.[15] Water quality typically worsens during the rainy season and outbreaks are more common at this time.[15] In areas with four seasons, infections are more common in the winter.[17] Worldwide, bottle-feeding of babies with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause.[15] Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene, (especially among children),[18] in crowded households,[37] and in those with poor nutritional status.[17] Adults who have developed immunities might still carry certain organisms without exhibiting symptoms.[17] Thus, adults can become natural reservoirs of certain diseases.[17] While some agents (such as Shigella) only occur in primates, others (such as Giardia) may occur in a wide variety of animals.[17]
 There are a number of non-infectious causes of inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.[1] Some of the more common include medications (like NSAIDs), certain foods such as lactose (in those who are intolerant), and gluten (in those with celiac disease). Crohn's disease is also a non-infectious cause of (often severe) gastroenteritis.[1] Disease secondary to toxins may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: ciguatera poisoning due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish, scombroid associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, tetrodotoxin poisoning from the consumption of puffer fish among others, and botulism typically due to improperly preserved food.[38]
 In the United States, rates of emergency department use for noninfectious gastroenteritis dropped 30% from 2006 until 2011. Of the twenty most common conditions seen in the emergency department, rates of noninfectious gastroenteritis had the largest decrease in visits in that time period.[39]
 Gastroenteritis is defined as vomiting or diarrhea due to inflammation of the small or large bowel, often due to infection.[17] The changes in the small bowel are typically noninflammatory, while the ones in the large bowel are inflammatory.[17] The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one (for Cryptosporidium) to as many as 108 (for Vibrio cholerae).[17]
 Gastroenteritis is typically diagnosed clinically, based on a person's signs and symptoms.[18] Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter the management of the condition.[15]
 However, stool cultures should be performed in those with blood in the stool, those who might have been exposed to food poisoning, and those who have recently traveled to the developing world.[13] It may also be appropriate in children younger than 5, old people, and those with poor immune function.[40] Diagnostic testing may also be done for surveillance.[18] As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended.[23] Electrolytes and kidney function should also be checked when there is a concern about severe dehydration.[13]
 A determination of whether or not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases.[1] In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing.[23][41] Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth.[1] A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring.[23] Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration.[1] Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.[42]
 Other potential causes of signs and symptoms that mimic those seen in gastroenteritis that need to be ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus.[13] Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered.[43] The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).[1]
 Appendicitis may present with vomiting, abdominal pain, and a small amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases.[1] This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis.[1] Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea.[1] Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea.[1] One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.[1]
 A supply of easily accessible uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices are important for reducing rates of infection and clinically significant gastroenteritis.[17] Personal hygiene measures (such as hand washing with soap) have been found to decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%.[23] Alcohol-based gels may also be effective.[23] Food or drink that is thought to be contaminated should be avoided.[44]
Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally.[15] Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration.[1]
 Due to both its effectiveness and safety, in 2009 the World Health Organization recommended that the rotavirus vaccine be offered to all children globally.[25][45] Two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist and several more are in development.[45] In Africa and Asia these vaccines reduced severe disease among infants[45] and countries that have put in place national immunization programs have seen a decline in the rates and severity of disease.[46][47] This vaccine may also prevent illness in non-vaccinated children by reducing the number of circulating infections.[48] Since 2000, the implementation of a rotavirus vaccination program in the United States has substantially decreased the number of cases of diarrhea by as much as 80 percent.[49][50][51] The first dose of vaccine should be given to infants between 6 and 15 weeks of age.[25] The oral cholera vaccine has been found to be 50–60% effective over two years.[52]
 There are a number of vaccines against gastroenteritis in development. For example, vaccines against Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), which are two of the leading bacterial causes of gastroenteritis worldwide.[53][54]
 Gastroenteritis is usually an acute and self-limiting disease that does not require medication.[22] The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT).[24] For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful,[55] and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.[56]
 The primary treatment of gastroenteritis in both children and adults is rehydration. This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution, although intravenous delivery may be required if there is a decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe.[57][58] Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars.[59] Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under five years of age as they may increase diarrhea.[22] Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them.[22] A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.[13] In those who require intravenous fluids, one to four hours' worth is often sufficient.[60]
 It is recommended that breast-fed infants continue to be nursed in the usual fashion,  and that formula-fed infants continue their formula immediately after rehydration with ORT.[61] Lactose-free or lactose-reduced formulas usually are not necessary.[61] Children should continue their usual diet during episodes of diarrhea with the exception that foods high in simple sugars should be avoided.[61] The BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast and tea) is no longer recommended, as it contains insufficient nutrients and has no benefit over normal feeding.[61]
 A Cochrane Review from 2020 concludes that probiotics make little or no difference to people who have diarrhea lasting 2 days or longer and that there is no proof that they reduce its duration.[62] They may be useful in preventing and treating antibiotic associated diarrhea.[63] Fermented milk products (such as yogurt) are similarly beneficial.[64] Zinc supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in the developing world.[65]
 Antiemetic medications may be helpful for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting.[55][66][67][68] Metoclopramide might also be helpful.[68] However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children.[69] The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants.[70] Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, does not appear to have a significant clinical benefit.[1]
 Antibiotics are not usually used for gastroenteritis, although they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe[71] or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected.[72] If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates of resistance to the latter.[19] Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin.[73] Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella[74] Salmonella typhi,[75] and Giardia species.[36] In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole.[36][76] The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.[1]
 Antimotility medication has a theoretical risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown this to be unlikely,[43] these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever.[77] Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea.[78] Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, can be used in mild to moderate cases,[43] but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.[1]
 It is estimated that there were two billion cases of gastroenteritis that resulted in 1.3 million deaths globally in 2015.[6][7] Children and those in the developing world are most commonly affected.[15] As of 2011, in those younger than five, there were about 1.7 billion cases resulting in 0.7 million deaths,[16] with most of these occurring in the world's poorest nations.[17] More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under five years of age.[10][79] Cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly.[31] In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant gastroenteritis.[17] It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of acquired immunity.[18]
 In 1980, gastroenteritis from all causes caused 4.6 million deaths in children, with the majority occurring in the developing world.[73] Death rates were reduced significantly (to approximately 1.5 million deaths annually) by 2000, largely due to the introduction and widespread use of oral rehydration therapy.[80] In the US, infections causing gastroenteritis are the second most common infection (after the common cold), and they result in between 200 and 375 million cases of acute diarrhea[17][18] and approximately ten thousand deaths annually,[17] with 150 to 300 of these deaths in children less than five years of age.[1]
 Gastroenteritis is associated with many colloquial names, including ""Montezuma's revenge"", ""Delhi belly"", ""la turista"", and ""back door sprint"", among others.[17] It has played a role in many military campaigns and is believed to be the origin of the term ""no guts no glory"".[17]
 Gastroenteritis is the main reason for 3.7 million visits to physicians a year in the United States[1] and 3 million visits in France.[81] In the United States gastroenteritis as a whole is believed to result in costs of US$23 billion per year,[82] with rotavirus alone resulting in estimated costs of US$1 billion a year.[1]
 
The first usage of ""gastroenteritis"" was in 1825.[83] Before this time it was commonly known as typhoid fever or ""cholera morbus"", among others, or less specifically as ""griping of the guts"", ""surfeit"", ""flux"", ""colic"", ""bowel complaint"", or any one of a number of other archaic names for acute diarrhea.[84] Cholera morbus is a historical term that was used to refer to gastroenteritis rather than specifically cholera.[85]
 Many of the same agents cause gastroenteritis in cats and dogs as in humans. The most common organisms are Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella.[86] A large number of toxic plants may also cause symptoms.[87]
 Some agents are more specific to a certain species. Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) occurs in pigs resulting in vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration.[88] It is believed to be introduced to pigs by wild birds and there is no specific treatment available.[89] It is not transmissible to humans.[90]

"Stomach flu, viral gastroenteritis, is a viral infection in your digestive system. It causes gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea. It’s usually brief, but can be very contagious. Stomach flu is a viral infection that affects your stomach and intestines. The medical term is viral gastroenteritis. “Gastro” means stomach and “enter” means small intestine. “Itis” means inflammation, which is usually due to an infection. And “viral” means that a virus has caused the infection. Stomach flu causes gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal cramps and nausea. You might also call it a “stomach bug.” A stomach bug isn’t always a virus — sometimes it’s bacteria or a parasite — but in any case, the symptoms are similar. You might not be able to tell if your bug is a virus or not. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Stomach flu isn’t related to “the flu” (influenza), which is a viral infection in your respiratory system. Different viruses cause the two conditions, and they affect different body systems. It’s not clear how the nickname “stomach flu” developed or why it’s been associated with influenza, but we can speculate. Both are common viral infections that circulate during the same “flu season,” so people might use “flu” to simply mean, “I’m sick”. “Stomach flu” might be a way of saying, “I’m sick, and it’s the stomach one”. Even though a stomach bug isn’t always a virus, it’s likely to be, so “stomach flu” is a good guess. Viral gastroenteritis is extremely common worldwide, but it’s hard to estimate exactly how many people get it each year. Many different viruses cause it, and most people don’t get clinically tested for it. Experts estimate that norovirus, the most common cause, infects 685 million people every year. The most common stomach flu symptoms are: These symptoms come from inflammation in your stomach and intestines. (Although the name, gastroenteritis, refers to your stomach and small intestine, inflammation can spread to your large intestine, too). Inflammation is your immune system activating to fight the virus. If your infection is more severe, or if your immune system reacts more strongly to it, you may have what are known as systemic symptoms. These symptoms come from inflammation in other body systems outside of your digestive system. This is the next level of immune response to the virus. Systemic symptoms may include: For many people, stomach flu symptoms seem to come on suddenly and out of nowhere. You might throw up or have diarrhea many times on that first day. Symptoms occur one to two days after you were exposed to the virus. Fortunately, they’re usually over just as quickly, resolving in one to two days. Advertisement The stages of stomach flu infection are: Stomach flu usually only lasts a few days, but it may last up to a week or two in severe cases. People with weaker immune systems may have a harder time defeating the virus, and it may take longer. Yes, it’s very contagious. You should limit your contact with others when you have it. If you live with others, make sure to wash your hands often and disinfect shared surfaces, especially in the bathroom. You’re most contagious during the acute phase of the infection (when you have symptoms) and for a few days after. However, you may still be a little contagious for up to two weeks after recovering. Many different viruses can infect your gastrointestinal system, causing gastroenteritis. The most common ones are: Advertisement Stomach flu usually spreads by the “fecal-to-oral route”. The virus lives in the poop — and vomit — of infected people. Microscopic traces of infected poop or vomit may linger on people’s hands or surfaces. These traces can transfer to food and water sources. You might ingest the virus through contaminated food or water, or by touching an infected person or surface and then touching your mouth. Anyone can get stomach flu, but certain people are more vulnerable. If you have a weaker-than-average immune system, you might be more likely to get an infection or get a more severe infection. You might have a weaker immune system if you have a chronic disease that affects immunity or take immunosuppressant medications. Infants and elderly people are also more susceptible to infections. For most people, stomach flu is uncomplicated and self-limited. It goes away shortly by itself. But those with weaker immune systems may have a more severe infection and be more likely to experience complications. The most likely complication is dehydration. This happens when you lose too many fluids and electrolytes from diarrhea or vomiting, and you can’t drink enough or drink fast enough to replace them. People with weaker immune systems (especially children) are more likely to become dehydrated, and it can be especially dangerous for them. Stay alert for signs of dehydration, such as: Healthcare providers often diagnose gastroenteritis based on your symptoms. They won’t know if it’s viral or which virus it is without doing a lab test to find out. But most of the time, this isn’t necessary. Since there isn’t any specific medicine for stomach flu, there’s no need to identify it, or the virus. Your immune system gets rid of stomach flu through its own natural processes. It just takes a few days to do its work. Your symptoms, while unpleasant, are a sign that your immune system is working. There’s no medicine for stomach flu. Antibiotics don’t work on viruses — they’re for bacterial infections. The best thing you can do to help your immune system do its work is to stay home and rest, stay hydrated and eat a little if you can. Give your body the energy it needs to fight the infection. To stay hydrated, take small sips throughout the day, before you feel thirsty, or suck on ice chips. Some research shows that taking probiotics may help stomach flu go away faster. Probiotics are helpful bacteria that live in your gastrointestinal system. Having enough helpful bacteria in your gut is part of having a healthy immune system. Ask a healthcare provider if probiotics might help you. What you eat won’t improve stomach flu, but it can make it worse. Foods high in fat, sugar, caffeine or dairy milk might make you more likely to throw up or have diarrhea. You might have little appetite or feel nauseous at the thought of food. Focus on foods that are easy to digest and give you a quick dose of energy, like fruit juice popsicles, broths and saltine crackers. The salt can help replace your electrolytes. Healthcare providers can treat dehydration with intravenous fluids. This is a way of delivering hydration directly to your bloodstream, bypassing your digestive system. In some cases, healthcare providers may prescribe medications to reduce vomiting or diarrhea. They don’t prescribe these for children, though. Contact a healthcare provider if: You can reduce your risk of getting stomach flu or spreading it to others by practicing good hygiene.This includes: For most people, symptoms get better in a few days. Contact a healthcare provider if they aren’t improving. People with weaker immune systems may need treatment for dehydration or medications to reduce their symptoms. It’s also possible that you have a different condition if you aren’t improving. It’s best to say isolated until two days after your symptoms have stopped. This is the time when you’re most contagious. Even though your body has overcome the infection, you’ll still shed the live virus in your poop. If any trace of that poop comes into contact with another person, they could get sick. Stomach flu isn’t related to “the flu” (influenza), which is a viral infection in your respiratory system. The flu vaccine won’t protect you from stomach flu. Different viruses cause these two conditions, and they affect different body systems. Most of their symptoms are different, though a few may overlap. Influenza causes respiratory symptoms like congestion, a sore throat or a runny nose. Stomach flu causes gastrointestinal symptoms, like diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Both may cause “systemic symptoms” like fever and fatigue. Children may have some gastrointestinal symptoms with both. People probably mean different things when they use this phrase. They might be referring to symptoms of influenza. Or they might be referring to systemic symptoms, which are more common with viral infections in general than with other types. Some people might mean gastrointestinal symptoms. Stomach flu and food poisoning are both infections that cause gastroenteritis, with similar symptoms. The different names describe the different origins of the infection. Viral gastroenteritis comes from a virus, while food poisoning comes from eating food that’s contaminated, either by a virus or something else. Food poisoning can cause stomach flu if you get the virus from food. This is common, and in this case, both names describe the same condition. But other types of contamination can also cause food poisoning, like bacteria. Bacterial food poisoning has a few small differences from stomach flu. A note from Cleveland Clinic Almost everyone gets stomach flu at some point. Since many different viruses can cause it, you may get it more than once. Children in daycare centers and schools and people in care facilities are more at risk of getting it from their communities, and they may experience more severe symptoms with it. For most people, stomach flu is unpleasant but brief. But for some, it can be dangerous. If you care for a child or older person with stomach flu, watch for signs of dehydration and stay in touch with a healthcare provider. Take steps to protect yourself from the virus and to prevent it from spreading to others. Last reviewed on 07/10/2023. Learn more about our editorial process.

Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world. Treatments — including eyedrops, laser treatments and surgeries — can slow down vision loss and save your sight. Glaucoma is a general term used to describe a group of eye disorders that damage your optic nerve. It’s the most common form of optic nerve damage leading to vision loss. In most cases, fluid builds up in the front part of your eye. This extra fluid puts pressure on your eye, gradually damaging your optic nerve. The name of this pressure is intraocular pressure (IOP), or eye pressure. Some people have normal eye pressure and still get glaucoma. Untreated glaucoma or poorly managed glaucoma can lead to permanent and irreversible vision loss and blindness. Most people develop glaucoma in both eyes, although the disease initially may be worse in one eye. With open-angle glaucoma, one eye may have moderate or severe damage, while the other eye may be mildly affected. People with closed-angle glaucoma in one eye have a 40% to 80% chance of developing the same type of glaucoma in the other eye within five to 10 years. Glaucoma is a common age-related eye issue that affects an estimated 3 million Americans. Globally, it’s the second leading cause of blindness after cataracts. There are several types of glaucoma, including: This type is the most common, affecting up to 90% of Americans who have glaucoma. It occurs when resistance builds up in your eye’s drainage canals. Your drainage canals appear to be open and functioning normally. Over months or years, the fluid in your eye can build up and put pressure on your optic nerve. The disease may go unnoticed for years because most people don’t have symptoms. Also called angle-closure or narrow-angle glaucoma, this rare type often comes on suddenly (acute). It occurs when the angle between your iris and cornea is too narrow. It may happen when your pupil changes and becomes too big (dilated) too quickly. This blocks your drainage canals and prevents aqueous fluid from leaving your eye, causing eye pressure to rise. Symptoms, including eye pain and headaches, can be severe and require immediate medical attention. As many as 1 in 3 people have optic nerve damage even when eye pressure is normal or not very high. Experts are uncertain about what causes normal-tension glaucoma. Another name for this type is normal-pressure or low-tension glaucoma. This type is more common among people of Asian descent or Asian Americans. Some babies are born with drainage canals that don’t form properly in the womb. Your healthcare provider might notice your baby’s glaucoma symptoms at birth or signs may become noticeable during childhood. Other names for this type are childhood, infantile or pediatric glaucoma.

Policy People want to know what the early warning symptoms of glaucoma are. The problem is that for some types of glaucoma, there aren’t any early warning symptoms, and changes to vision can happen gradually, so the symptoms are easy to miss. Because many people with open-angle glaucoma don’t have any noticeable symptoms, it’s very important to have routine eye exams to detect this disease in its earlier stages. Glaucoma damage is irreversible, so you need early detection and treatment to prevent blindness. Closed-angle glaucoma has more severe symptoms that tend to come on suddenly. With any type, you may experience: Glaucoma can occur without any cause, but many factors can affect it. The most important of these factors is intraocular eye pressure. Your eyes produce a fluid called aqueous humor that nourishes them. This liquid flows through your pupil to the front of your eye. In a healthy eye, the fluid leaves through the drainage canals located between your iris and cornea. With glaucoma, the resistance increases in your drainage canals. The fluid has nowhere to go, so it builds up in your eye. This excess fluid puts pressure on your eye. Eventually, this elevated eye pressure can damage your optic nerve and lead to glaucoma. Advertisement Glaucoma can affect anyone, but the risk increases with age. People who are Black and Hispanic are much more likely to get glaucoma than other ethnic groups, and they tend to develop the disease earlier in life. Asian and Inuit populations are also more susceptible to a specific form of glaucoma known as angle-closure glaucoma or closed-angle glaucoma. People with diabetes are twice as likely to get glaucoma. Other risk factors include: It’s possible to have glaucoma and not know it. Regular eye exams are important to catch glaucoma or other eye problems. Eye exams can assess optic health and vision loss. To check for glaucoma, an eye doctor may do one or more of these painless tests: Advertisement Untreated glaucoma can lead to the faster development of permanent vision loss or blindness. Treatments can slow down additional vision loss, but they can’t restore lost vision. It’s important to see an eye doctor right away if you have eye pain, severe headaches or vision problems. Many types of prescription eye drops can treat glaucoma. Some decrease fluids and increase drainage to improve eye pressure. Because glaucoma is a lifelong condition, you may need to use daily eye drops for life. You may have to apply them more than once a day. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new delivery device for bimatoprost, a glaucoma treatment that’s been available as eye drops. Now, you can get an implant that dissolves and works for several months. Your eye care provider places the bimatoprost implant (Durysta®) into your eye. Currently, you can only have it placed once in each eye. Your eye doctor uses a laser (a strong beam of light) to help improve fluid drainage from your eye. Your provider may suggest lasers as a first-line therapy instead of drops or in addition to eye drops. Having laser treatment may not replace the use of eye drops completely. The results from laser treatments vary but can last for years in some cases. Your provider may be able to repeat some types of laser treatments. Surgery is another way to help reduce eye pressure. It’s more invasive but can also achieve better eye pressure control faster than drops or lasers. Surgery can help slow down vision loss, but it can’t restore lost vision or cure glaucoma. There are many types of surgeries for glaucoma, and depending on the specific type and severity, your eye doctor may choose one over another. For instance, there’s traditional surgery that involves cutting your eye and minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (called MIGS). There are many types of MIGS procedures available, including different types of stents or devices used to improve the outflow of fluid from your eye. The MIGS procedures typically take less time to perform and have a faster recovery time with potentially fewer risks than traditional glaucoma surgeries. The types of surgeries available for glaucoma, especially the less invasive MIGS procedures, continue to expand and evolve. An estimated 1 in 10 people with glaucoma develop some degree of visual impairment. Blindness is less common and affects 5% of people with glaucoma. No, there’s no cure for glaucoma. However, you can manage symptoms and stop the disease from getting worse. There isn’t one best treatment for glaucoma. Your provider may suggest one treatment for you and a different one for someone else who has glaucoma. Early detection of glaucoma through routine eye exams is the best way to protect eye health and prevent vision loss. Glaucoma testing should occur every: Blindness is a rare complication for people with glaucoma, as long as a provider detects it early. However, glaucoma is a chronic and progressive condition that often causes some degree of vision loss over time. The earlier you catch glaucoma and start treatments, the better the odds of saving your vision. Treatments can slow down disease progression and vision loss. If you’re at high risk for glaucoma, you should get regular eye exams. You should call your healthcare provider if you experience: You may want to ask your healthcare provider: A note from Cleveland Clinic While there isn’t a cure for glaucoma, treatments can keep eye pressure under control and prevent vision loss. Eye exams can catch the disease early and save your sight. If you’re at high risk for glaucoma, ask your eye doctor how often you need screenings. If you have glaucoma, it’s important to use daily eye drops as prescribed. You can also ask your provider about laser treatments and surgery options. With proper care, you can keep glaucoma from worsening and causing irreversible vision loss or blindness. Last reviewed on 11/18/2022. Learn more about our editorial process.

 Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that lead to damage of the optic nerve, which transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the ""silent thief of sight"" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time.[5] A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP).[1] It is associated with old age, a family history of glaucoma, and certain medical conditions or medications.[6] The word glaucoma comes from the Ancient Greek word γλαυκός (glaukós), meaning 'gleaming, blue-green, gray'.
 There are different types of glaucoma, but the most common are called open-angle glaucoma and closed-angle glaucoma.[7] Inside the eye, a liquid called aqueous humor helps to maintain shape and provides nutrients. The aqueous humor normally drains through the trabecular meshwork. In open-angle glaucoma, the draining is impeded, causing the liquid to accumulate and pressure inside the eye to increase. This elevated pressure can damage the optic nerve. In closed-angle glaucoma, the drainage of the eye becomes suddenly blocked, leading to a rapid increase in intraocular pressure. This may lead to intense eye pain, blurred vision, and nausea. Closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency requiring immediate attention.[1]
 If treated early, it is possible to slow or stop the progression of glaucoma. Regular eye examinations, especially if the person is over 40 or has a family history of glaucoma, are essential for early detection.[8] Treatment typically includes prescription of eye drops, medication, laser treatment or surgery.[1][9] The goal of these treatments is to decrease eye pressure.[2]
 Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in African Americans, Hispanic Americans,[10][11] and Asians.[12] It occurs more commonly among older people,[1] and closed-angle glaucoma is more common in women.[2]
 In 2013 for the population aged 40-80 years the global prevalence of glaucoma was estimated at 3.54%, thus affecting 64.3 million worldwide. The same year, there were 2.97 million people in North America with open angle glaucoma. By 2040, the prevalence of all types of glaucoma was projected to increase to 111.82 million worldwide and to 4.72 million in North America.[14]
 Both internationally and in the United States, glaucoma is the second-leading cause of blindness.[2] Globally, cataracts are a more common cause. Glaucoma is also the leading cause of blindness in African Americans, who have higher rates of primary open-angle glaucoma.[15][16] Bilateral vision loss can negatively affect mobility and interfere with driving.[17]
 A meta-analysis published in 2009 found that people with primary open angle glaucoma do not have increased mortality rates, or increased risk of cardiovascular death.[18]
 Open angle glaucoma usually presents with no symptoms early in the course of the disease.[19] However, it may gradually progress to involve difficulties with vision.[19] It usually involves deficits in the peripheral vision followed by central vision loss as the disease progresses, but less commonly it may present as central vision loss or patchy areas of vision loss.[19] On an eye examination, optic nerve changes are seen indicating damage to the optic nerve head (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).[19]
 Acute angle closure glaucoma, a medical emergency due to the risk of impending permanent vision loss, is characterized by sudden ocular pain, seeing halos around lights, red eye, very high intraocular pressure, nausea and vomiting, and suddenly decreased vision.[19] Acute angle closure glaucoma may further present with corneal edema, engorged conjunctival vessels and a fixed and dilated pupil on examination.[20]
 Opaque specks may occur in the lens in glaucoma, known as glaukomflecken.[21] The word is German, meaning ""glaucoma-specks"".
 Glaucoma can affect anyone; there are some people, however, with a higher susceptibility to develop glaucoma due to certain risk factors. Risk factors for glaucoma include increasing age, high intraocular pressure, a family history of glaucoma, and use of steroid medication.[1]
 Ocular hypertension (increased pressure within the eye) is an important risk factor for glaucoma, but only about 10-70% of people - depending on ethnic group - with primary open-angle glaucoma actually have elevated ocular pressure.[22] Ocular hypertension—an intraocular pressure above the traditional threshold of 21 mmHg (28 hPa) or even above 24 mmHg (32 hPa)—is not necessarily a pathological condition, but it increases the risk of developing glaucoma. 
 A study with 1636 persons aged 40-80 who had an intraocular pressure of ≥ 24 mm Hg in at least one eye but no indications of eye damages showed that after five years 9.5% of the untreated persons and 4.4% of the treated person had developed glaucomatous symptoms, meaning that only about one in ten untreated people with elevated intraocular pressure will develop glaucomatous symptoms over that period of time. Therefore, it is a matter of debate whether every person with an elevated intraocular pressure should receive glaucoma therapy. As of 2018, most ophthalmologists favored treatment of those with additional risk factors.[23]
 For eye pressures, a value of 28 hPa (21 mmHg) above atmospheric pressure 1,010 hPa (760 mmHg) is often used, with higher pressures leading to a greater risk.[2][24] However, some may have high eye pressure for years and never develop damage.[2] Conversely, optic nerve damage may occur with normal pressure, known as normal-tension glaucoma.[25] In case of above-normal intraocular pressure the mechanism of open-angle glaucoma is believed to be the impeded exit of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork, while in closed-angle glaucoma the iris blocks the trabecular meshwork.[2] Diagnosis is achieved by performing an eye examination.[1] Often, the optic nerve shows an abnormal amount of cupping.[2]
 Positive family history is a risk factor for glaucoma. The relative risk of having primary open-angle glaucoma is increased about two- to four-fold for people who have a sibling with glaucoma.[26] Glaucoma, particularly primary open-angle glaucoma, is associated with mutations in several genes, including MYOC, ASB10, WDR36, NTF4, TBK1,[27] and RPGRIP1.[28] Many of these genes are involved in critical cellular processes that are implicated in the development and progression of glaucoma, including regulation of intraocular pressure, retinal ganglion cell health, and optic nerve function.[29] Normal-tension glaucoma, which comprises 30-90% of primary open-angle glaucoma (depending on ethnic group),[22] is also associated with genetic mutations (including OPA1 and OPTN genes).[30]
 Additionally, there are some rare genetic conditions that increase the risk of glaucoma, such as Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and primary congenital glaucoma, which is  associated with mutations in CYP1B1 or LTBP2.[31] They are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.[31] Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is associated with PITX2 or FOXC1.[32]
 The total prevalence of glaucoma is about the same in North America and Asia. However, the prevalence of angle-closure glaucoma is four times higher in Asia than in North America.[14]
 In the United States, glaucoma is more common in African Americans, Latinos and Asian-Americans.[19]
 Other factors can cause glaucoma, known as ""secondary glaucoma"", including prolonged use of steroids (steroid-induced glaucoma); conditions that severely restrict blood flow to the eye, such as severe diabetic retinopathy and central retinal vein occlusion (neovascular glaucoma); ocular trauma (angle-recession glaucoma); plateau iris; and inflammation of the middle layer of the pigmented vascular eye structure (uveitis), known as uveitic glaucoma.
 The main effect of glaucoma is damage to the optic nerve. Eventually, this damage leads to vision loss, which can deteriorate with time. The underlying cause of open-angle glaucoma remains unclear. Several theories exist on its exact etiology. Only in the ethnic group of whites the major risk factor and the focus of treatment is increased intraocular pressure.[22] Intraocular pressure is a function of production of liquid aqueous humor by the ciliary processes of the eye, and its drainage through the trabecular meshwork. Aqueous humor flows from the ciliary processes into the posterior chamber, bounded posteriorly by the lens and the zonules of Zinn, and anteriorly by the iris. It then flows through the pupil of the iris into the anterior chamber, bounded posteriorly by the iris and anteriorly by the cornea.
 From here, the trabecular meshwork drains aqueous humor via the scleral venous sinus (Schlemm's canal) into scleral plexuses and general blood circulation.[34]
 In open/wide-angle glaucoma, flow is reduced through the trabecular meshwork, due to the degeneration and obstruction of the trabecular meshwork, whose original function is to absorb the aqueous humor. Loss of aqueous humor absorption leads to increased resistance and thus a chronic, painless buildup of pressure in the eye.[35]
 In primary angle closure glaucoma, the iridocorneal angle is narrowed or completely closed obstructing the flow of aqueous humor to the trabecular meshwork for drainage. This is usually due to the forward displacement of the iris against the cornea, resulting in angle closure. This accumulation of aqueous humor causes an acute increase in pressure and damage to the optic nerve.[19]
 The pathophysiology of glaucoma is not well understood. There are several theories regarding the mechanism of the damage to the optic nerve in glaucoma. The biomechanical theory hypothesizes that the retinal ganglion cell axons (which form the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer) are particularly susceptible to mechanical damage from increases in the intraocular pressure as they pass through pores at the lamina cribrosa. Thus increases in intraocular pressure would cause nerve damage as seen in glaucoma.[19] The vascular theory hypothesizes that a decreased blood supply to the retinal ganglions cells leads to nerve damage. This decrease in blood supply may be due to increasing intraocular pressures, and may also be due to systemic hypotension, vasospasm or atherosclerosis.[19] This is supported by evidence that those with low blood pressure, particularly low diastolic blood pressure, are at an increased risk of glaucoma.[19]
 The primary neurodegeneration theory hypothesizes that a primary neurodegenerative process may be responsible for degeneration at the optic nerve head in glaucoma.[19] This would be consistent with a possible mechanism of normal tension glaucoma (those with open-angle glaucoma with normal eye pressures) and is supported by evidence showing a correlation of glaucoma with Alzheimer's dementia and other causes of cognitive decline.[36][37]
Both experimental and clinical studies implicate that oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of open-angle glaucoma[38] as well as in Alzheimer's disease.[39]
 Degeneration of axons of the retinal ganglion cells (the optic nerve) is a hallmark of glaucoma.[40] The inconsistent relationship of glaucomatous optic neuropathy with increased intraocular pressure has provoked hypotheses and studies on anatomic structure, eye development, nerve compression trauma, optic nerve blood flow, excitatory neurotransmitter, trophic factor, retinal ganglion cell or axon degeneration, glial support cell, immune system, aging mechanisms of neuron loss, and severing of the nerve fibers at the scleral edge.[41][42][43][44][45][46][47]
 Screening for glaucoma is an integral part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists.[48] The workup for glaucoma involves taking a thorough case history, with the emphasis on assessment of risk factors. 
 The baseline glaucoma evaluation tests include intraocular pressure measurement by using tonometry, anterior chamber angle assessment by optical coherence tomography, inspecting the drainage angle (gonioscopy), and retinal nerve fiber layer assessment with a fundus examination, measuring corneal thickness (pachymetry), and visual field testing.[48]
 Glaucoma has been classified into specific types:[49]
 Primary glaucoma (H40.1-H40.2)
 Variants of primary glaucoma
 Primary angle closure glaucoma is caused by contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork, which in turn obstructs outflow of the aqueous humor from the eye. This contact between iris and trabecular meshwork (TM) may gradually damage the function of the meshwork until it fails to keep pace with aqueous production, and the pressure rises. In over half of all cases, prolonged contact between iris and TM causes the formation of synechiae (effectively ""scars"").
 These cause permanent obstruction of aqueous outflow. In some cases, pressure may rapidly build up in the eye, causing pain and redness (symptomatic, or so-called ""acute"" angle closure). In this situation, the vision may become blurred, and halos may be seen around bright lights. Accompanying symptoms may include a headache and vomiting.
 Diagnosis is made from physical signs and symptoms: pupils mid-dilated and unresponsive to light, cornea edematous (cloudy), reduced vision, redness, and pain. However, the majority of cases are asymptomatic. Prior to the very severe loss of vision, these cases can only be identified by examination, generally by an eye care professional.
 Developmental glaucoma (Q15.0)
 Secondary glaucoma (H40.3-H40.6)
 Neovascular glaucoma, an uncommon type of glaucoma, is difficult or nearly impossible to treat, and is often caused by proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). It may also be triggered by other conditions that result in ischemia of the retina or ciliary body. Individuals with poor blood flow to the eye are highly at risk for this condition.
 Neovascular glaucoma results when new, abnormal vessels begin developing in the angle of the eye that begin blocking the drainage. People with such condition begin to rapidly lose their eyesight. Sometimes, the disease appears very rapidly, especially after cataract surgery procedures.
 Toxic glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma with an unexplained significant rise of intraocular pressure following unknown pathogenesis. Intraocular pressure can sometimes reach 80 mmHg (11 kPa). It characteristically manifests as ciliary body inflammation and massive trabecular edema that sometimes extends to Schlemm's canal. This condition is differentiated from malignant glaucoma by the presence of a deep and clear anterior chamber and a lack of aqueous misdirection. Also, the corneal appearance is not as hazy. A reduction in visual acuity can occur followed neuroretinal breakdown.
 Absolute glaucoma (H44.5) is the end stage of all types of glaucoma. The eye has no vision, absence of pupillary light reflex and pupillary response, and has a stony appearance. Severe pain is present in the eye. The treatment of absolute glaucoma is a destructive procedure like cyclocryoapplication, cyclophotocoagulation, or injection of 99% alcohol.
 In glaucoma visual field defects result from damage to the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Field defects are seen mainly in primary open angle glaucoma. Because of the unique anatomy of the RNFL, many noticeable patterns are seen in the visual field. Most of the early glaucomatous changes are seen within the central visual field, mainly in Bjerrum's area, 10-20° from fixation.[51]
 Following are the common glaucomatous field defects:
 The United States Preventive Services Task Force stated, as of 2013, that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for glaucoma.[57] Therefore, there is no national screening program in the US. Screening, however, is recommended starting at age 40 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.[2]
 There is a glaucoma screening program in the UK. Those at risk are advised to have an eye examination at least once a year.[58]
 
 The goal of glaucoma management for patients with increased intraocular pressure is to decrease the intraocular pressure (IOP), thus slowing the progression of glaucoma and preserving the quality of life for patients, with minimal side-effects.[59][60][61] This requires appropriate diagnostic techniques and follow-up examinations, and judicious selection of treatments for the individual patient. Although increased IOP is only one of the major risk factors for glaucoma, lowering it via various pharmaceuticals and/or surgical techniques is currently the mainstay of glaucoma treatment. 
 Vascular flow and neurodegenerative theories of glaucomatous optic neuropathy have prompted studies on various neuroprotective therapeutic strategies, including nutritional compounds, some of which may be regarded by clinicians as safe for use now, while others are on trial.[62][63][64] Mental stress is also considered as consequence and cause of vision loss which means that stress management training, autogenic training and other techniques to cope with stress can be helpful.[65][66]
 There are several pressure-lowering medication groups that could be used in lowering the IOP, usually eyedrops. The choice of medication usually depends on the dose, duration and the side effects of each medication. However, in general, prostaglandin analogues are the first-line treatment for glaucoma.[61][67]
 Prostaglandin analogues, such as latanoprost, bimatoprost and travoprost, reduce the IOP by increasing the aqueous fluid outflow through the draining angle. It is usually prescribed once daily at night. The systemic side effects of this class are minimal. However, they can cause local side effects including redness of the conjunctiva, change in the iris color and eyelash elongation.[61][67]
 There are several other classes of medications that could be used as a second-line in case of treatment failure or presence of contraindications to prostaglandin analogues.[68][67] These include:
 Each of these medicines may have local and systemic side effects. Wiping the eye with an absorbent pad after the administration of eye drops may result in fewer adverse effects.[69] Initially, glaucoma drops may reasonably be started in either one or in both eyes.[70]
 The possible neuroprotective effects of various topical and systemic medications are also being investigated.[71][72][73][74]
 Poor compliance with medications and follow-up visits is a major reason for treatment failure and disease progression in glaucoma patients. Poor adherence could lead to increased complication rates, thus increasing the need of non-pharmacological interventions including surgery. Patient education and communication must be ongoing to sustain successful treatment plans for this lifelong disease with no early symptoms.[75]
 Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) may be used to treat open-angle glaucoma, but this is a temporary solution, not a cure. A 50-μm argon laser spot is aimed at the trabecular meshwork to stimulate the opening of the mesh to allow more outflow of aqueous fluid. Usually, half of the angle is treated at a time. Traditional laser trabeculoplasty uses a thermal argon laser in an argon laser trabeculoplasty procedure.
 Nd:YAG laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) may be used in patients susceptible to or affected by angle closure glaucoma or pigment dispersion syndrome. During laser iridotomy, laser energy is used to make a small, full-thickness opening in the iris to equalize the pressure between the front and back of the iris, thus correcting any abnormal bulging of the iris. In people with narrow angles, this can uncover the trabecular meshwork. In some cases of intermittent or short-term angle closure, this may lower the eye pressure. Laser iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases, it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular meshwork. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have shown that an optimal iridotomy size to relieve the pressure differential between the anterior and posterior side of the iris is around 0.1 mm to 0.2 mm.[76] This coincides with clinical practice of LPI where an iridotomy size of 150 to 200 microns is commonly used. However, larger iriditomy sizes are sometimes necessary.
 Both laser and conventional surgeries are performed to treat glaucoma. Surgery is the primary therapy for those with congenital glaucoma.[77] Generally, these operations are a temporary solution, as there is not yet a cure for glaucoma.
 Canaloplasty is a nonpenetrating procedure using microcatheter technology. To perform a canaloplasty, an incision is made into the eye to gain access to the Schlemm's canal in a similar fashion to a viscocanalostomy. A microcatheter will circumnavigate the canal around the iris, enlarging the main drainage channel and its smaller collector channels through the injection of a sterile, gel-like material called viscoelastic. The catheter is then removed and a suture is placed within the canal and tightened.
 By opening the canal, the pressure inside the eye may be relieved, although the reason is unclear, since the canal (of Schlemm) does not have any significant fluid resistance in glaucoma or healthy eyes. Long-term results are not available.[78][79]
 The most common conventional surgery performed for glaucoma is the trabeculectomy. Here, a partial thickness flap is made in the scleral wall of the eye, and a window opening is made under the flap to remove a portion of the trabecular meshwork. The scleral flap is then sutured loosely back in place to allow fluid to flow out of the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure and the formation of a bleb or fluid bubble on the surface of the eye.
 Scarring can occur around or over the flap opening, causing it to become less effective or lose effectiveness altogether. Traditionally, chemotherapeutic adjuvants, such as mitomycin C (MMC) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), are applied with soaked sponges on the wound bed to prevent filtering blebs from scarring by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation. Contemporary alternatives to prevent the scarring of the meshwork opening include the sole or combinative implementation of nonchemotherapeutic adjuvants such as the Ologen collagen matrix, which has been clinically shown to increase the success rates of surgical treatment.[80][81][82][83]
 Collagen matrix prevents scarring by randomizing and modulating fibroblast proliferation in addition to mechanically preventing wound contraction and adhesion.
 The first glaucoma drainage implant was developed in 1966.[84] Since then, several types of implants have followed on from the original: the Baerveldt tube shunt, or the valved implants, such as the Ahmed glaucoma valve implant or the ExPress Mini Shunt and the later generation pressure ridge Molteno implants. These are indicated for glaucoma patients not responding to maximal medical therapy, with previous failed guarded filtering surgery (trabeculectomy). The flow tube is inserted into the anterior chamber of the eye, and the plate is implanted underneath the conjunctiva to allow a flow of aqueous fluid out of the eye into a chamber called a bleb.
 The ongoing scarring over the conjunctival dissipation segment of the shunt may become too thick for the aqueous humor to filter through. This may require preventive measures using antifibrotic medications, such as 5-fluorouracil or mitomycin-C (during the procedure), or other nonantifibrotic medication methods, such as collagen matrix implant,[90][91] or biodegradable spacer, or later on create a necessity for revision surgery with the sole or combinative use of donor patch grafts or collagen matrix implant.[91]
 The most common surgical approach currently used for the treatment of glaucoma is trabeculectomy, in which the sclera is punctured to alleviate intraocular pressure.
 Nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (NPDS) surgery is a similar, but modified, procedure, in which instead of puncturing the scleral bed and trabecular meshwork under a scleral flap, a second deep scleral flap is created, excised, with further procedures of deroofing the Schlemm's canal, upon which, percolation of liquid from the inner eye is achieved and thus alleviating intraocular pressure, without penetrating the eye. NPDS is demonstrated to have significantly fewer side effects than trabeculectomy.[92] However, NPDS is performed manually and requires higher level of skills that may be assisted with instruments.[citation needed]   In order to prevent wound adhesion after deep scleral excision and to maintain good filtering results, NPDS as with other non-penetrating procedures is sometimes performed with a variety of biocompatible spacers or devices, such as the Aquaflow collagen wick,[93] ologen Collagen Matrix,[82][94][95] or Xenoplast glaucoma implant.[96]
 Laser-assisted NPDS is performed with the use of a CO2 laser system. The laser-based system is self-terminating once the required scleral thickness and adequate drainage of the intraocular fluid have been achieved. This self-regulation effect is achieved as the CO2 laser essentially stops ablating as soon as it comes in contact with the intraocular percolated liquid, which occurs as soon as the laser reaches the optimal residual intact layer thickness.
 For people with chronic closed-angle glaucoma, lens extraction can relieve the block created by the pupil and help regulate the intraocular pressure.[97] A study found that CLE is even more effective than laser peripheral iridotomy in patients with angle closure glaucoma.[98]
 Primary angle closure glaucoma: Once any symptoms have been controlled, the first line (and often definitive) treatment is laser iridotomy. This may be performed using either Nd:YAG or argon lasers, or in some cases by conventional incisional surgery. The goal of treatment is to reverse and prevent contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork. In early to moderately advanced cases, iridotomy is successful in opening the angle in around 75% of cases. In the other 25%, laser iridoplasty, medication (pilocarpine) or incisional surgery may be required.
 Primary open-angle glaucoma: Prostaglandin agonists work by opening uveoscleral passageways. Beta-blockers, such as timolol, work by decreasing aqueous formation. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease bicarbonate formation from ciliary processes in the eye, thus decreasing the formation of aqueous humor. Parasympathetic analogs are drugs that work on the trabecular outflow by opening up the passageway and constricting the pupil. Alpha 2 agonists (brimonidine, apraclonidine) both decrease fluid production (via inhibition of AC) and increase drainage. A review of people with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension concluded that medical IOP-lowering treatment slowed down the progression of visual field loss.[9]
 Anti-VEGF agents as injectable medications, along with other standard of care treatment for decreasing intraocular pressure, may improve pressure in people with neovascular glaucoma for short periods of time.[99] Evidence suggests that this improvement may last 4–6 weeks.[99] There is no sufficient evidence to suggest that anti-VEGF medications are effective either for short-term or for longer-term treatment.[99] The short, medium, and long-term safety of anti-VEGF treatment has not been well investigated.[99]
 Cannabis is not suggested for treatment of glaucoma by the American Glaucoma Society for adults or for children.[100][101]
 In open-angle glaucoma, the typical progression from normal vision to complete blindness takes about 25 years to 70 years without treatment, depending on the method of estimation used.[102]
 The association of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma was first described by Englishman Richard Banister in 1622: ""...that the Eye be grown more solid and hard, then naturally it should be..."".[103] Angle-closure glaucoma was treated with cataract extraction by John Collins Warren in Boston as early as 1806.[104] The invention of the ophthalmoscope by Hermann Helmholtz in 1851 enabled ophthalmologists for the first time to identify the pathological hallmark of glaucoma, the excavation of the optic nerve head due to retinal ganglion cell loss. The first reliable instrument to measure intraocular pressure was invented by Norwegian ophthalmologist Hjalmar August Schiøtz in 1905. About half a century later, Hans Goldmann in Berne, Switzerland, developed his applanation tonometer which still today - despite numerous new innovations in diagnostics - is considered the gold standard of determining this crucial pathogenic factor. In the late 20th century, further pathomechanisms beyond elevated IOP were discovered and became the subject of research like insufficient blood supply – often associated with low or irregular blood pressure – to the retina and optic nerve head.[105] The first drug to reduce IOP, pilocarpine, was introduced in the 1870s; other major innovations in pharmacological glaucoma therapy were the introduction of beta blocker eye drops in the 1970s and of prostaglandin analogues and topical (locally administered) carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in the mid-1990s.. Early surgical techniques like iridectomy and fistulating methods have recently been supplemented by less invasive procedures like small implants, a range of options now widely called MIGS (micro-invasive glaucoma surgery).
 The word ""glaucoma"" comes from the Ancient Greek γλαύκωμα,[106] a derivative of γλαυκός (glaukos),[107] which commonly described the color of eyes which were not dark (i.e. blue, green, light gray). Eyes described as γλαυκός due to disease might have had a gray cataract in the Hippocratic era, or, in the early Common Era, the greenish pupillary hue sometimes seen in angle-closure glaucoma.[108][109] This colour is reflected in the Chinese word for glaucoma, 青光眼 (qīngguāngyǎn), literally “cyan-light eye”. An alternative hypothesis connects the name to the Ancient Greek noun for 'owl',[110] γλαύξ or γλαῦξ (both glaux).
 The TAGS randomised controlled trial investigated if eye drops or trabeculectomy is more effective in treating advanced primary open-angle glaucoma. After two years researchers found that vision and quality of life are similar in both treatments. At the same time eye pressure was lower in people who underwent surgery and in the long-run surgery is more cost-effective.[111][112]
 The LiGHT trial compared the effectiveness of eye drops and selective laser trabeculoplasty for open angle glaucoma. Both contributed to a similar quality of life but most people undergoing laser treatment were able to stop using eye drops. Laser trabeculoplasty was also shown to be more cost-effective.[113]
 A 2013 Cochrane systematic review compared the effect of brimonidine and timolol in slowing the progression of open angle glaucoma in adult participants.[114] The results showed that participants assigned to brimonidine showed less visual field progression than those assigned to timolol, though the results were not significant, given the heavy loss-to-followup and limited evidence.[114] The mean intraocular pressures for both groups were similar. Participants in the brimonidine group had a higher occurrence of side effects caused by medication than participants in the timolol group.[114]
 A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease.[115] It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.
 A study in 2017 shows that there is a huge difference in the volume of glaucoma testing depending on the type of insurance in the US.[116] Researchers reviewed 21,766 persons age ≥ 40 years old with newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and found that Medicaid recipients had substantially lower volume of glaucoma testing performed compared to patients with commercial health insurance.
 Results from a meta-analysis of 33,428 primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) participants published in 2021 suggest that there are substantial ethnic and racial disparities in clinical trials in the US.[117] Although ethnic and racial minorities have a higher disease burden, the 70.7% of the study participants was White as opposed to 16.8% Black and 3.4% Hispanic/Latino.

 Glaucoma is a common eye condition where the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain, becomes damaged. It's usually caused by fluid building up in the front part of the eye, which increases pressure inside the eye. Glaucoma can lead to loss of vision if it's not diagnosed and treated early. It can affect people of all ages, but is most common in adults in their 70s and 80s. Glaucoma does not usually cause any symptoms to begin with. It tends to develop slowly over many years and affects the edges of your vision (peripheral vision) first. For this reason, many people do not realise they have glaucoma, and it's often only picked up during a routine eye test. If you do notice any symptoms, they might include blurred vision, or seeing rainbow-coloured circles around bright lights. Both eyes are usually affected, although it may be worse in 1 eye. Very occasionally, glaucoma can develop suddenly and cause: Visit an opticians or a GP if you have any concerns about your vision. If you have glaucoma, early diagnosis and treatment can help stop your vision getting worse. Without treatment, glaucoma can eventually lead to blindness. If you develop symptoms of glaucoma suddenly, go to your nearest eye casualty unit or A&E as soon as possible. This is a medical emergency that may require immediate treatment. There are several different types of glaucoma. The most common is called primary open angle glaucoma. This tends to develop slowly over many years. It's caused by the drainage channels in the eye becoming gradually clogged over time. Other types of glaucoma include: Glaucoma can occur for a number of reasons. Most cases are caused by a build-up of pressure in the eye when fluid is unable to drain properly. This increase in pressure then damages the nerve that connects the eye to the brain (optic nerve). It's often unclear why this happens, although certain things can increase the risk, including: It's not clear whether you can do anything to prevent glaucoma, but having regular eye tests should pick it up as early as possible. Glaucoma can usually be detected during a routine eye test at an opticians, often before it causes any noticeable symptoms. The tests are carried out in the opticians by an optometrist. You should have a routine eye test at least every 2 years. Find out if you're eligible for free NHS eye tests Several quick and painless tests can be carried out to check for glaucoma, including vision tests and measurements of the pressure inside your eye. If tests suggest you have glaucoma, you should be referred to a specialist eye doctor (ophthalmologist) to discuss treatment. Find out how glaucoma is diagnosed It's not possible to reverse any loss of vision that occurred before glaucoma was diagnosed, but treatment can help stop your vision getting worse. The treatment recommended for you will depend on the type of glaucoma you have, but the options are: You'll also probably need regular appointments to monitor your condition and check the treatment is working. The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and Glaucoma UK have more information on glaucoma and offer further support for people affected by glaucoma. In this video, an expert explains what glaucoma is, how it can affect your vision and how it can be treated.

"Glaucoma is an eye disease that can damage your optic nerve tissue and result in vision loss. Treatment may involve medications or surgery, depending on the type. The optic nerve supplies visual information to your brain from your eyes.  Glaucoma is usually, but not always, the result of abnormally high pressure inside your eye. Over time, the increased pressure can erode your optic nerve tissue, which may lead to vision loss or even blindness. If it’s caught early, you may be able to prevent additional vision loss. The most common type of glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma. It has no signs or symptoms except gradual vision loss. For that reason, it’s important that you go to yearly comprehensive eye exams so your ophthalmologist, or eye specialist, can monitor any changes in your vision. Acute-angle closure glaucoma, which is also known as narrow-angle glaucoma, is a medical emergency. See your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms: The back of your eye continuously makes a clear fluid called aqueous humor. As this fluid is made, it fills the front part of your eye. Then, it leaves your eye through channels in your cornea and iris. If these channels are blocked or partially obstructed, the natural pressure in your eye, which is called the intraocular pressure (IOP), may increase. As your IOP increases, your optic nerve may become damaged. As damage to your nerve progresses, you may begin losing sight in your eye. What causes the pressure in your eye to increase isn’t always known. However, doctors believe one or more of these factors may play a role: Five major types of glaucoma exist. These are: Open-angle, or chronic, glaucoma has no signs or symptoms except gradual vision loss. This loss may be so slow that your vision can suffer irreparable damage before any other signs become apparent. According the National Eye Institute (NEI), this is the most common type of glaucoma.  If the flow of your aqueous humor fluid is suddenly blocked, the rapid buildup of fluid may cause a severe, quick, and painful increase in pressure. Angle-closure glaucoma is an emergency situation. You should call your doctor immediately if you begin experiencing symptoms, such as severe pain, nausea, and blurred vision. Children born with congenital glaucoma have a defect in the angle of their eye, which slows or prevents normal fluid drainage. Congenital glaucoma usually presents with symptoms, such as cloudy eyes, excessive tearing, or sensitivity to light. Congenital glaucoma can run in families. Secondary glaucoma is often a side effect of injury or another eye condition, such as cataracts or eye tumors. Medicines, such as corticosteroids, may also cause this type of glaucoma. Rarely, eye surgery can cause secondary glaucoma. In some cases, people without increased eye pressure develop damage to their optic nerve. The cause of this isn’t known. However, extreme sensitivity or a lack of blood flow to your optic nerve may be a factor in this type of glaucoma. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness around the world. The risk factors for glaucoma include: People over 60 are at increased risk of glaucoma, warns the NEI, and the risk of glaucoma increases slightly with each year of age. If you’re African-American, your increase in risk begins at age 40. African-Americans or people of African descent are significantly more likely to develop glaucoma than Caucasians. People of Asian descent are at a higher risk of angle-closure glaucoma, and people of Japanese descent have a higher risk of developing low-tension glaucoma. Chronic eye inflammation and thin corneas can lead to increased pressure in your eyes. Physical injury or trauma to your eye, such as being hit in your eye, can also cause your eye pressure to increase. Some types of glaucoma may run in families. If your parent or grandparent had open-angle glaucoma, you’re at an increased risk of developing the condition. People with diabetes and those with high blood pressure and heart disease have an increased risk of developing glaucoma. Using corticosteroids for extended periods may increase your risk of developing secondary glaucoma.  To diagnose glaucoma, your ophthalmologist will want to perform a comprehensive eye examination. They’ll check for signs of deterioration, including loss of nerve tissue. They may also use one or more of the following tests and procedures: Your doctor will want to know what symptoms you’ve been experiencing and if you have any personal or family history of glaucoma. They’ll also ask for a general health assessment to determine if any other health conditions may be impacting your eye health, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. This class of tests measures your eye’s internal pressure. People with thin corneas have an increased risk of developing glaucoma. A pachymetry test can tell your doctor if your corneas are thinner than average. This test, also known as a visual field test, can tell your doctor if glaucoma is affecting your vision by measuring your peripheral, or side, vision and your central vision. If your doctor wants to monitor for gradual changes to your optic nerve, they may take photographs of your optic nerve to conduct a side-by-side comparison over time. The goal of glaucoma treatment is to reduce IOP to stop any additional eyesight loss. Typically, your doctor will begin treatment with prescription eye drops. If these don’t work or more advanced treatment is needed, your doctor may suggest one of the following treatments: Several medicines designed to reduce IOP are available. These medicines are available in the form of eye drops or pills, but the drops are more common. Your doctor may prescribe one or a combination of these. If a blocked or slow channel is causing increased IOP, your doctor may suggest surgery to make a drainage path for fluid or destroy tissues that are responsible for the increased fluid. Treatment for angle-closure glaucoma is different. This type of glaucoma is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment to reduce eye pressure as quickly as possible. Medicines are usually attempted first, to reverse the angle closure, but this may be unsuccessful. A laser procedure called laser peripheral iridotomy may also be performed. This procedure creates small holes in your iris to allow for increased fluid movement. If your increased IOP can be stopped and the pressure returned to normal, vision loss can be slowed or even stopped. However, because there’s no cure for glaucoma, you’ll likely need treatment for the rest of your life to regulate your IOP. Unfortunately, vision lost as a result of glaucoma cannot be restored. Glaucoma can’t be prevented, but it’s still important to catch it early so you can begin treatment that will help prevent it from getting worse. The best way to catch any type of glaucoma early is to have an annual preventive eye care appointment. Make an appointment with an ophthalmologist. Simple tests performed during these routine eye checks may be able to detect damage from glaucoma before it advances and begins causing vision loss.

"Heart disease includes many diseases that affect your heart, but coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common and familiar one. CAD can create a waxy buildup in your heart’s arteries that can cause a heart attack. Healthy habits, medicines and procedures can prevent or treat CAD and other heart diseases. Heart disease is a variety of issues that can affect your heart. When people think about heart disease, they often think of the most common type — coronary artery disease (CAD) and the heart attacks it can cause. But you can have trouble with different parts of your heart, like your heart muscle, valves or electrical system. When your heart isn’t working well, it has trouble sending enough blood, oxygen and nutrients to your body. In a way, your heart delivers the fuel that keeps your body’s systems running. If there’s a problem with delivering that fuel, it affects everything your body’s systems do. Lifestyle changes and medications can keep your heart healthy and lower your chances of getting heart disease. Heart disease types include: Heart disease is the top cause of death in the United States. In 2021, heart disease caused 1 in 5 deaths. That’s nearly 700,000 people. Coronary artery disease, the most common type of heart disease, caused about 375,000 of those deaths. Heart disease affects people from most ethnic backgrounds, regardless of sex.

 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is any disease involving the heart or blood vessels.[3] CVDs constitute a class of diseases that includes: coronary artery diseases (e.g. angina, heart attack), heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, carditis, aortic aneurysms, peripheral artery disease, thromboembolic disease, and venous thrombosis.[3][4]
 The underlying mechanisms vary depending on the disease.[3] It is estimated that dietary risk factors are associated with 53% of CVD deaths.[6] Coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease involve atherosclerosis.[3] This may be caused by high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes mellitus, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, excessive alcohol consumption,[3]  and poor sleep,[7][8] among other things. High blood pressure is estimated to account for approximately 13% of CVD deaths, while tobacco accounts for 9%, diabetes 6%, lack of exercise 6%, and obesity 5%.[3] Rheumatic heart disease may follow untreated strep throat.[3]
 It is estimated that up to 90% of CVD may be preventable.[9][10] Prevention of CVD involves improving risk factors through: healthy eating, exercise, avoidance of tobacco smoke and limiting alcohol intake.[3] Treating risk factors, such as high blood pressure, blood lipids and diabetes is also beneficial.[3] Treating people who have strep throat with antibiotics can decrease the risk of rheumatic heart disease.[11] The use of aspirin in people who are otherwise healthy is of unclear benefit.[12][13]
 Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide except Africa.[3] Together CVD resulted in 17.9 million deaths (32.1%) in 2015, up from 12.3 million (25.8%) in 1990.[5][4] Deaths, at a given age, from CVD are more common and have been increasing in much of the developing world, while rates have declined in most of the developed world since the 1970s.[14][15] Coronary artery disease and stroke account for 80% of CVD deaths in males and 75% of CVD deaths in females.[3] Most cardiovascular disease affects older adults. In the United States 11% of people between 20 and 40 have CVD, while 37% between 40 and 60, 71% of people between 60 and 80, and 85% of people over 80 have CVD.[2] The average age of death from coronary artery disease in the developed world is around 80, while it is around 68 in the developing world.[14] CVD is typically diagnosed seven to ten years earlier in men than in women.[3]: 48 
 There are many cardiovascular diseases involving the blood vessels. They are known as vascular diseases.[citation needed]
 There are also many cardiovascular diseases that involve the heart.
 There are many risk factors for heart diseases: age, sex, tobacco use, physical inactivity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, excessive alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, obesity, genetic predisposition and family history of cardiovascular disease, raised blood pressure (hypertension), raised blood sugar (diabetes mellitus), raised blood cholesterol (hyperlipidemia), undiagnosed celiac disease, psychosocial factors, poverty and low educational status, air pollution, and poor sleep.[3][17][18][19][20][21] While the individual contribution of each risk factor varies between different communities or ethnic groups the overall contribution of these risk factors is very consistent.[22] Some of these risk factors, such as age, sex or family history/genetic predisposition, are immutable; however, many important cardiovascular risk factors are modifiable by lifestyle change, social change, drug treatment (for example prevention of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes).[23] People with obesity are at increased risk of atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries.[24]
 Cardiovascular disease in a person's parents increases their risk by ~3 fold,[25] and genetics is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic cardiovascular disease can occur either as
a consequence of single variant (Mendelian) or polygenic influences.[26] There are more than 40 inherited cardiovascular disease that can be traced to a single disease-causing DNA variant, although these conditions are rare.[26] Most common cardiovascular diseases are non-Mendelian and are thought to be due to hundreds or thousands of genetic variants (known as single nucleotide polymorphisms), each associated with a small effect.[27][28]
 Age is the most important risk factor in developing cardiovascular or heart diseases, with approximately a tripling of risk with each decade of life.[29]  Coronary fatty streaks can begin to form in adolescence.[30] It is estimated that 82 percent of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 and older.[31] Simultaneously, the risk of stroke doubles every decade after age 55.[32]
 Multiple explanations are proposed to explain why age increases the risk of cardiovascular/heart diseases. One of them relates to serum cholesterol level.[33] In most populations, the serum total cholesterol level increases as age increases. In men, this increase levels off around age 45 to 50 years. In women, the increase continues sharply until age 60 to 65 years.[33]
 Aging is also associated with changes in the mechanical and structural properties of the vascular wall, which leads to the loss of arterial elasticity and reduced arterial compliance and may subsequently lead to coronary artery disease.[34]
 Men are at greater risk of heart disease than pre-menopausal women.[29][35] Once past menopause, it has been argued that a woman's risk is similar to a man's[35] although more recent data from the WHO and UN disputes this.[29] If a female has diabetes, she is more likely to develop heart disease than a male with diabetes.[36] Women who have high blood pressure and had complications in their pregnancy have three times the risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to women with normal blood pressure who had no complications in pregnancy.[37][38]
 Coronary heart diseases are 2 to 5 times more common among middle-aged men than women.[33]  In a study done by the World Health Organization, sex contributes to approximately 40% of the variation in sex ratios of coronary heart disease mortality.[39] Another study reports similar results finding that sex differences explains nearly half the risk associated with cardiovascular diseases[33] One of the proposed explanations for sex differences in cardiovascular diseases is hormonal difference.[33]  Among women, estrogen is the predominant sex hormone. Estrogen may have protective effects on glucose metabolism and hemostatic system, and may have direct effect in improving endothelial cell function.[33]  The production of estrogen decreases after menopause, and this may change the female lipid metabolism toward a more atherogenic form by decreasing the HDL cholesterol level while increasing LDL and total cholesterol levels.[33]
 Among men and women, there are differences in body weight, height, body fat distribution, heart rate, stroke volume, and arterial compliance.[34] In the very elderly, age-related large artery pulsatility and stiffness are more pronounced among women than men.[34] This may be caused by the women's smaller body size and arterial dimensions which are independent of menopause.[34]
 Cigarettes are the major form of smoked tobacco.[3] Risks to health from tobacco use result not only from direct consumption of tobacco, but also from exposure to second-hand smoke.[3] Approximately 10% of cardiovascular disease is attributed to smoking;[3] however, people who quit smoking by age 30 have almost as low a risk of death as never smokers.[40]
 Insufficient physical activity (defined as less than 5 x 30 minutes of moderate activity per week, or less than 3 x 20 minutes of vigorous activity per week) is currently the fourth leading risk factor for mortality worldwide.[3]  In 2008, 31.3% of adults aged 15 or older (28.2% men and 34.4% women) were insufficiently physically active.[3]
The risk of ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus is reduced by almost a third in adults who participate in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week (or equivalent).[41] In addition, physical activity assists weight loss and improves blood glucose control, blood pressure, lipid profile and insulin sensitivity. These effects may, at least in part, explain its cardiovascular benefits.[3]
 High dietary intakes of saturated fat, trans-fats and salt, and low intake of fruits, vegetables and fish are linked to cardiovascular risk, although whether all these associations indicate causes is disputed. The World Health Organization attributes approximately 1.7 million deaths worldwide to low fruit and vegetable consumption.[3]  Frequent consumption of high-energy foods, such as processed foods that are high in fats and sugars, promotes obesity and may increase cardiovascular risk.[3]  The amount of dietary salt consumed may also be an important determinant of blood pressure levels and overall cardiovascular risk.[3]  There is moderate quality evidence that reducing saturated fat intake for at least two years reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.[42] High trans-fat intake has adverse effects on blood lipids and circulating inflammatory markers,[43] and elimination of trans-fat from diets has been widely advocated.[44][45] In 2018 the World Health Organization estimated that trans fats were the cause of more than half a million deaths per year.[45] There is evidence that higher consumption of sugar is associated with higher blood pressure and unfavorable blood lipids,[46] and sugar intake also increases the risk of diabetes mellitus.[47] High consumption of processed meats is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, possibly in part due to increased dietary salt intake.[19]
 The relationship between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease is complex, and may depend on the amount of alcohol consumed.[48] There is a direct relationship between high levels of drinking alcohol and cardiovascular disease.[3]  Drinking at low levels without episodes of heavy drinking may be associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease,[49] but there is evidence that associations between moderate alcohol consumption and protection from stroke are non-causal.[50] At the population level, the health risks of drinking alcohol exceed any potential benefits.[3][51]
 Untreated celiac disease can cause the development of many types of cardiovascular diseases, most of which improve or resolve with a gluten-free diet and intestinal healing. However, delays in recognition and diagnosis of celiac disease can cause irreversible heart damage.[20]
 A lack of good sleep, in amount or quality, is documented as increasing cardiovascular risk in both adults and teens. Recommendations suggest that Infants typically need 12 or more hours of sleep per day, adolescent at least eight or nine hours, and adults seven or eight. About one-third of adult Americans get less than the recommended seven hours of sleep per night, and in a study of teenagers, just 2.2 percent of those studied got enough sleep, many of whom did not get good quality sleep.  Studies have shown that short sleepers getting less than seven hours sleep per night have a 10 percent to 30 percent higher risk of cardiovascular disease.[7][52]
 Sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing and insomnia, are also associated with a higher cardiometabolic risk.[53]
An estimated 50 to 70 million Americans have insomnia, sleep apnea or other  chronic sleep disorders.[citation needed]
 In addition, sleep research displays differences in race and class. Short sleep and poor sleep tend to be more frequently reported in ethnic minorities than in whites. African-Americans report experiencing short durations of sleep five times more often than whites, possibly as a result of social and environmental factors.  Black children and children living in disadvantaged neighborhoods have much higher rates of sleep apnea.[8]
 Cardiovascular disease has a greater impact on low- and middle-income countries compared to those with higher income.[54] Although data on the social patterns of cardiovascular disease in low- and middle-income countries is limited,[54] reports from high-income countries consistently demonstrate that low educational status or income are associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease.[55] Policies that have resulted in increased socio-economic inequalities have been associated with greater subsequent socio-economic differences in cardiovascular disease[54] implying a cause and effect relationship. Psychosocial factors, environmental exposures, health behaviours, and health-care access and quality contribute to socio-economic differentials in cardiovascular disease.[56] The Commission on Social Determinants of Health recommended that more equal distributions of power, wealth, education, housing, environmental factors, nutrition, and health care were needed to address inequalities in cardiovascular disease and non-communicable diseases.[57]
 Particulate matter has been studied for its short- and long-term exposure effects on cardiovascular disease. Currently, airborne particles under 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) are the major focus, in which gradients are used to determine CVD risk. Overall, long-term PM exposure increased rate of atherosclerosis and inflammation. In regards to short-term exposure (2 hours), every 25 μg/m3 of PM2.5 resulted in a 48% increase of CVD mortality risk.[58] In addition, after only 5 days of exposure, a rise in systolic (2.8 mmHg) and diastolic (2.7 mmHg) blood pressure occurred for every 10.5 μg/m3 of PM2.5.[58]  Other research has implicated PM2.5 in irregular heart rhythm, reduced heart rate variability (decreased vagal tone), and most notably heart failure.[58][59]  PM2.5 is also linked to carotid artery thickening and increased risk of acute myocardial infarction.[58][59]
 Existing cardiovascular disease or a previous cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack or stroke, is the strongest predictor of a future cardiovascular event.[60] Age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, blood lipids and diabetes are important predictors of future cardiovascular disease in people who are not known to have cardiovascular disease.[61] These measures, and sometimes others, may be combined into composite risk scores to estimate an individual's future risk of cardiovascular disease.[60] Numerous risk scores exist although their respective merits are debated.[62] Other diagnostic tests and biomarkers remain under evaluation but currently these lack clear-cut evidence to support their routine use. They include family history, coronary artery calcification score, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), ankle–brachial pressure index,  lipoprotein subclasses and particle concentration, lipoprotein(a), apolipoproteins A-I and B, fibrinogen, white blood cell count, homocysteine, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide  (NT-proBNP), and markers of kidney function.[63][64] High blood phosphorus is also linked to an increased risk.[65]
 There is evidence that mental health problems, in particular depression and traumatic stress, is linked to cardiovascular diseases. Whereas mental health problems are known to be associated with risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as smoking, poor diet, and a sedentary lifestyle, these factors alone do not explain the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases seen in depression, stress, and anxiety.[66] Moreover, posttraumatic stress disorder is independently associated with increased risk for incident coronary heart disease, even after adjusting for depression and other covariates.[67]
 Little is known about the relationship between work and cardiovascular disease, but links have been established between certain toxins, extreme heat and cold, exposure to tobacco smoke, and mental health concerns such as stress and depression.[68]
 A 2015 SBU-report looking at non-chemical factors found an association for those:[69]
 Specifically the risk of stroke was also increased by exposure to ionizing radiation.[69] Hypertension develops more often in those who experience job strain and who have shift-work.[69] Differences between women and men in risk are small, however men risk having and dying of heart attacks or stroke twice as often as women during working life.[69]
 A 2017 SBU report found evidence that workplace exposure to silica dust, engine exhaust or welding fumes is associated with heart disease.[70] Associations also exist for exposure to arsenic, benzopyrenes, lead, dynamite, carbon disulphide, carbon monoxide, metalworking fluids and occupational exposure to tobacco smoke.[70] Working  with  the  electrolytic production of  aluminium  or  the  production  of  paper  when  the  sulphate pulping  process  is  used  is  associated with heart disease.[70] An association was also found  between  heart  disease  and  exposure  to  compounds  which  are  no  longer  permitted  in certain  work  environments,  such  as  phenoxy acids containing TCDD(dioxin) or asbestos.[70]
 Workplace exposure to silica dust or asbestos is also associated with pulmonary heart disease. There is evidence that workplace  exposure to lead, carbon disulphide, phenoxyacids containing  TCDD, as well as working in an environment where aluminum is being electrolytically produced, is associated with stroke.[70]
 As of 2017, evidence suggests that certain leukemia-associated mutations in blood cells may also lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Several large-scale research projects looking at human genetic data have found a robust link between the presence of these mutations, a condition known as clonal hematopoiesis, and cardiovascular disease-related incidents and mortality.[71]
 Radiation treatments (RT) for cancer can increase the risk of heart disease and death, as observed in breast cancer therapy.[72]  Therapeutic radiation increases the risk of a subsequent heart attack or stroke by 1.5 to 4 times;[73] the increase depends on the dose strength, volume, and location. Use of concomitant chemotherapy, e.g. anthracyclines, is an aggravating risk factor.[74] The occurrence rate of RT induced cardiovascular disease is estimated between 10% and 30%.[74]
 Side-effects from radiation therapy for cardiovascular diseases have been termed radiation-induced heart disease or radiation-induced cardiovascular disease.[75][76] Symptoms are dose-dependent and include cardiomyopathy, myocardial fibrosis, valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, heart arrhythmia and peripheral artery disease. Radiation-induced fibrosis, vascular cell damage and oxidative stress can lead to these and other late side-effect symptoms.[75]
 Population-based studies show that atherosclerosis, the major precursor of cardiovascular disease, begins in childhood. The Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) study demonstrated that intimal lesions appear in all the aortas and more than half of the right coronary arteries of youths aged 7–9 years.[78]
 Obesity and diabetes mellitus are linked to cardiovascular disease,[79] as are a history of chronic kidney disease and hypercholesterolaemia.[80]  In fact, cardiovascular disease is the most life-threatening of the diabetic complications and diabetics are two- to four-fold more likely to die of cardiovascular-related causes than nondiabetics.[81][82][83]
 Screening ECGs (either at rest or with exercise) are not recommended in those without symptoms who are at low risk.[84] This includes those who are young without risk factors.[85] In those at higher risk the evidence for screening with ECGs is inconclusive.[86] Additionally echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging, and cardiac stress testing is not recommended in those at low risk who do not have symptoms.[87] Some biomarkers may add to conventional cardiovascular risk factors in predicting the risk of future cardiovascular disease; however, the value of some biomarkers is questionable.[88][89] Ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and coronary artery calcium, are also of unclear benefit in those without symptoms as of 2018.[90]
 The NIH recommends lipid testing in children beginning at the age of 2 if there is a family history of heart disease or lipid problems.[91] It is hoped that early testing will improve lifestyle factors in those at risk such as diet and exercise.[92]
 Screening and selection for primary prevention interventions has traditionally been done through absolute risk using a variety of scores (ex. Framingham or Reynolds risk scores).[93] This stratification has separated people who receive the lifestyle interventions (generally lower and intermediate risk) from the medication (higher risk). The number and variety of risk scores available for use has multiplied, but their efficacy according to a 2016 review was unclear due to lack of external validation or impact analysis.[94] Risk stratification models often lack sensitivity for population groups and do not account for the large number of negative events among the intermediate and low risk groups.[93] As a result, future preventative screening appears to shift toward applying prevention according to randomized trial results of each intervention rather than large-scale risk assessment.
 Up to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided.[9][95] Currently practised measures to prevent cardiovascular disease include:
 Most guidelines recommend combining preventive strategies. There is some evidence that interventions aiming to reduce more than one cardiovascular risk factor may have beneficial effects on blood pressure, body mass index and waist circumference; however, evidence was limited and the authors were unable to draw firm conclusions on the effects on cardiovascular events and mortality.[127]
 There is additional evidence to suggest that providing people with a cardiovascular disease risk score may reduce risk factors by a small amount compared to usual care.[128] However, there was some uncertainty as to whether providing these scores had any effect on cardiovascular disease events. It is unclear whether or not dental care in those with periodontitis affects their risk of cardiovascular disease.[129] According to a 2021 WHO study, working 55+ hours a week raises the risk of stroke by 35% and the risk of dying from heart conditions by 17%, when compared to a 35-40 hours week.[130]
 A diet high in fruits and vegetables decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death.[131]
 A 2021 review found that plant-based diets can provide a risk reduction for CVD if a healthy plant-based diet is consumed. Unhealthy plant-based diets do not provide benefits over diets including meat.[97] A similar meta-analysis and systematic review also looked into dietary patterns and found ""that diets lower in animal foods and unhealthy plant foods, and higher in healthy plant foods are beneficial for CVD prevention"".[98] A 2018 meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that ""In most countries, a vegan diet is associated with a more favourable cardio-metabolic profile compared to an omnivorous diet.""[99]
 Evidence suggests that the Mediterranean diet may improve cardiovascular outcomes.[132] There is also evidence that a Mediterranean diet may be more effective than a low-fat diet in bringing about long-term changes to cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., lower cholesterol level and blood pressure).[133]
 The DASH diet (high in nuts, fish, fruits and vegetables, and low in sweets, red meat and fat) has been shown to reduce blood pressure,[134] lower total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol[135]  and improve metabolic syndrome;[136] but the long-term benefits have been questioned.[137] A high-fiber diet is associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease.[138]
 Worldwide, dietary guidelines recommend a reduction in saturated fat,[139] and although the role of dietary fat in cardiovascular disease is complex and controversial there is a long-standing consensus that replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat in the diet is sound medical advice.[140] Total fat intake has not been found to be associated with cardiovascular risk.[141][142] A 2020 systematic review found moderate quality evidence that reducing saturated fat intake for at least 2 years caused a reduction in cardiovascular events.[143]  A 2015 meta-analysis of observational studies however did not find a convincing association between saturated fat intake and cardiovascular disease.[144]  Variation in what is used as a substitute for saturated fat may explain some differences in findings.[140] The benefit from replacement with polyunsaturated fats appears greatest,[145]  while replacement of saturated fats with carbohydrates does not appear to have a beneficial effect.[145] A diet high in trans fatty acids is associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease,[146] and in 2015 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that there was 'no longer a consensus among qualified experts that partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs), which are the primary dietary source of industrially produced trans fatty acids (IP-TFA), are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for any use in human food'.[147] There is conflicting evidence concerning whether dietary supplements of omega-3 fatty acids (a type of polyunsaturated essential fatty acid) added to diet improve cardiovascular risk.[148][149]
 The benefits of recommending a low-salt diet in people with high or normal blood pressure are not clear.[150] In those with heart failure, after one study was left out, the rest of the trials show a trend to benefit.[151][152] Another review of dietary salt concluded that there is strong evidence that high dietary salt intake increases blood pressure and worsens hypertension, and that it increases the number of cardiovascular disease events; both as a result of the increased blood pressure and probably through other mechanisms.[153][154] Moderate evidence was found that high salt intake increases cardiovascular mortality; and some evidence was found for an increase in overall mortality, strokes, and left ventricular hypertrophy.[153]
 Overall, the current body of scientific evidence is uncertain on whether intermittent fasting could prevent cardiovascular disease.[155] Intermittent fasting may help people lose more weight than regular eating patterns, but was not different from energy restriction diets.[155]
 Blood pressure medication reduces cardiovascular disease in people at risk,[114] irrespective of age,[156] the baseline level of cardiovascular risk,[157] or baseline blood pressure.[158] The commonly-used drug regimens have similar efficacy in reducing the risk of all major cardiovascular events, although there may be differences between drugs in their ability to prevent specific outcomes.[159] Larger reductions in blood pressure produce larger reductions in risk,[159] and most people with high blood pressure require more than one drug to achieve adequate reduction in blood pressure.[160] Adherence to medications is often poor, and while mobile phone text messaging has been tried to improve adherence, there is insufficient evidence that it alters secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.[161][needs update]
 Statins are effective in preventing further cardiovascular disease in people with a history of cardiovascular disease.[162] As the event rate is higher in men than in women, the decrease in events is more easily seen in men than women.[162] In those at risk, but without a history of cardiovascular disease (primary prevention), statins decrease the risk of death and combined fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease.[163] The benefit, however, is small.[164] A United States guideline recommends statins in those who have a 12% or greater risk of cardiovascular disease over the next ten years.[165] Niacin, fibrates and CETP Inhibitors, while they may increase HDL cholesterol do not affect the risk of cardiovascular disease in those who are already on statins.[166] Fibrates lower the risk of cardiovascular and coronary events, but there is no evidence to suggest that they reduce all-cause mortality.[167]
 Anti-diabetic medication may reduce cardiovascular risk in people with Type 2 diabetes, although evidence is not conclusive.[168] A meta-analysis in 2009 including 27,049 participants and 2,370 major vascular events showed a 15% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular disease with more-intensive glucose lowering over an average follow-up period of 4.4 years, but an increased risk of major hypoglycemia.[169]
 Aspirin has been found to be of only modest benefit in those at low risk of heart disease, as the risk of serious bleeding is almost equal to the protection against cardiovascular problems.[170] In those at very low risk, including those over the age of 70, it is not recommended.[171][172] The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against use of aspirin for prevention in women less than 55 and men less than 45 years old; however, it is recommended for some older people.[173]
 The use of vasoactive agents for people with pulmonary hypertension with left heart disease or hypoxemic lung diseases may cause harm and unnecessary expense.[174]
 Antibiotics for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease
 Antibiotics may help patients with coronary disease to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.[175] However, evidence in 2021 suggests that antibiotics for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease are harmful, with increased mortality and occurrence of stroke;[175] the use of antibiotics is not supported for preventing secondary coronary heart disease.
 Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation following a heart attack reduces the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and leads to less hospitalizations.[176] There have been few high-quality studies of the benefits of exercise training in people with increased cardiovascular risk but no history of cardiovascular disease.[177]
 A systematic review estimated that inactivity is responsible for 6% of the burden of disease from coronary heart disease worldwide.[178] The authors estimated that 121,000 deaths from coronary heart disease could have been averted in Europe in 2008 if people had not been physically inactive. Low-quality evidence from a limited number of studies suggest that yoga has beneficial effects on blood pressure and cholesterol.[179] Tentative evidence suggests that home-based exercise programs may be more efficient at improving exercise adherence.[180]
 While a healthy diet is beneficial, the effect of antioxidant supplementation (vitamin E, vitamin C, etc.) or vitamins has not been shown to protect against cardiovascular disease and in some cases may possibly result in harm.[181][182][183][184] Mineral supplements have also not been found to be useful.[185] Niacin, a type of vitamin B3, may be an exception with a modest decrease in the risk of cardiovascular events in those at high risk.[186][187] Magnesium supplementation lowers high blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner.[188] Magnesium therapy is recommended for people with ventricular arrhythmia associated with torsades de pointes who present with long QT syndrome, and for the treatment of people with digoxin intoxication-induced arrhythmias.[189] There is no evidence that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation is beneficial.[190] A 2022 review found that some dietary supplements, including micronutrients, may reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease.[191]
 Cardiovascular disease is treatable with initial treatment primarily focused on diet and lifestyle interventions.[3] Influenza may make heart attacks and strokes more likely and therefore influenza vaccination may decrease the chance of cardiovascular events and death in people with heart disease.[192]
 Proper CVD management necessitates a focus on MI and stroke cases due to their combined high mortality rate, keeping in mind the cost-effectiveness of any intervention, especially in developing countries with low or middle-income levels.[93] Regarding MI, strategies using aspirin, atenolol, streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator have been compared for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in regions of low and middle income. The costs for a single QALY for aspirin and atenolol were less than US$25, streptokinase was about $680, and t-PA was $16,000.[193] Aspirin, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and statins used together for secondary CVD prevention in the same regions showed single QALY costs of $350.[193]
 There are also surgical or procedural interventions that can save someone's life or prolong it. For heart valve problems, a person could have surgery to replace the valve. For arrhythmias, a pacemaker can be put in place to help reduce abnormal heart rhythms and for a heart attack, there are multiple options two of these are a coronary angioplasty and a coronary artery bypass surgery.[194]
 There is probably no additional benefit in terms of mortality and serious adverse events when blood pressure targets were lowered to ≤ 135/85 mmHg from ≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg.[195]
 Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and in all regions except Africa.[3] In 2008, 30% of all global death was attributed to cardiovascular diseases. Death caused by cardiovascular diseases are also higher in low- and middle-income countries as over 80% of all global deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases occurred in those countries. It is also estimated that by 2030, over 23 million people will die from cardiovascular diseases each year.
 It is estimated that 60% of the world's cardiovascular disease burden will occur in the South Asian subcontinent despite only accounting for 20% of the world's population. This may be secondary to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Organizations such as the Indian Heart Association are working with the World Heart Federation to raise awareness about this issue.[196]
 There is evidence that cardiovascular disease existed in pre-history,[197] and research into cardiovascular disease dates from at least the 18th century.[198]  The causes, prevention, and/or treatment of all forms of cardiovascular disease remain active fields of biomedical research, with hundreds of scientific studies being published on a weekly basis.
 Recent areas of research include the link between inflammation and atherosclerosis[199]  the potential for novel therapeutic interventions,[200] and the genetics of coronary heart disease.[201]

 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a general term for conditions affecting the heart or blood vessels. It's usually associated with a build-up of fatty deposits inside the arteries (atherosclerosis) and an increased risk of blood clots. It can also be associated with damage to arteries in organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys and eyes. CVD is one of the main causes of death and disability in the UK, but it can often largely be prevented by leading a healthy lifestyle. There are many different types of CVD. 4 of the main types are described on this page. Coronary heart disease occurs when the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle is blocked or reduced. This puts an increased strain on the heart, and can lead to: Read more about coronary heart disease. A stroke is where the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off, which can cause brain damage and possibly death. A transient ischaemic attack (also called a TIA or ""mini-stroke"") is similar, but the blood flow to the brain is only temporarily disrupted. The main symptoms of a stroke or TIA can be remembered with the word FAST, which stands for: Read more about stroke and TIAs. Peripheral arterial disease occurs when there's a blockage in the arteries to the limbs, usually the legs. This can cause: Read more about peripheral arterial disease. Aortic diseases are a group of conditions affecting the aorta. This is the largest blood vessel in the body, which carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. One of most common aortic diseases is an aortic aneurysm, where the aorta becomes weakened and bulges outwards. This doesn't usually have any symptoms, but there's a chance it could burst and cause life-threatening bleeding. Read more about aortic aneurysm. The exact cause of CVD isn't clear, but there are lots of things that can increase your risk of getting it. These are called ""risk factors"". The more risk factors you have, the greater your chances of developing CVD. If you're over 40, you'll be invited by your GP for an NHS Health Check every 5 years. Part of this check involves assessing your individual CVD risk and advising you how to reduce it if necessary. High blood pressure (hypertension) is one of the most important risk factors for CVD. If your blood pressure is too high, it can damage your blood vessels. Read more about high blood pressure. Smoking and other tobacco use is also a significant risk factor for CVD. The harmful substances in tobacco can damage and narrow your blood vessels. Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in the blood. If you have high cholesterol, it can cause your blood vessels to narrow and increase your risk of developing a blood clot. Read more about high cholesterol. Diabetes is a lifelong condition that causes your blood sugar level to become too high. High blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels, making them more likely to become narrowed. Many people with type 2 diabetes are also overweight or obese, which is also a risk factor for CVD. If you don't exercise regularly, it's more likely that you'll have high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and be overweight. All of these are risk factors for CVD. Exercising regularly will help keep your heart healthy. When combined with a healthy diet, exercise can also help you maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or obese increases your risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure, both of which are risk factors for CVD. You're at an increased risk of CVD if: Read more about obesity. If you have a family history of CVD, your risk of developing it is also increased. You're considered to have a family history of CVD if either: Tell your doctor or nurse if you have a family history of CVD. They may suggest checking your blood pressure and cholesterol level. In the UK people of south Asian and Black African or African Caribbean background have an increased risk of getting CVD. This is because people from these backgrounds are more likely to have other risk factors for CVD, such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes. Other factors that affect your risk of developing CVD include: A healthy lifestyle can lower your risk of CVD. If you already have CVD, staying as healthy as possible can reduce the chances of it getting worse. If you smoke, you should try to give up as soon as possible. The NHS Better Health website can provide information, support and advice to help. Your GP can also provide you with advice and support. They can also prescribe medication to help you quit. Read more about stopping smoking and stop smoking treatments. A healthy, balanced diet is recommended for a healthy heart. A balanced diet includes: Read more about healthy eating. Adults are advised to do at least 150 minutes of moderate activity a week, such as cycling or brisk walking. If you find it difficult to do this, start at a level you feel comfortable with and gradually increase the duration and intensity of your activity as your fitness improves. Visit your GP for a health check if you haven't exercised before or you're returning to exercise after a long break. Read advice about starting exercise. If you're overweight or obese, a combination of regular exercise and a healthy diet can help you lose weight. If you're struggling to lose weight, your GP or practice nurse can help you come up with a weight loss plan and recommend services in your area. Read more about losing weight and how your GP can help. If you drink alcohol, try not to exceed the recommended limit of 14 alcohol units a week for men and women. If you do drink this much, you should aim to spread your drinking over 3 days or more. A unit of alcohol is roughly equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. A small glass of wine (125ml) is about 1.5 units. Your GP can give you help and advice if you're finding it difficult to cut down your drinking. If you have a particularly high risk of developing CVD due to high blood cholesterol, your GP may recommend taking medicines called statins to reduce your risk.

 Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver;[2] it is a type of viral hepatitis.[6] During the initial infection period, people often have mild or no symptoms.[1] Early symptoms can include fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin.[1] The virus persists in the liver, becoming chronic, in about 70% of those initially infected.[4] Early on, chronic infection typically has no symptoms.[1] Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis.[1] In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop serious complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach.[2]
 HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with injection drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions.[1][3] In regions where blood screening has been implemented, the risk of contracting HCV from a transfusion has dropped substantially to less than one per two million.[1] HCV may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth.[1] It is not spread through breast milk, food, water or casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.[4] It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.[7]
Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or viral RNA.[1] In the United States, screening for HCV infection is recommended in all adults age 18 to 79 years old.[8]
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.[1][9] Prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who inject drugs, testing donated blood, and treatment of people with chronic infection.[4][10] Chronic infection can be cured more than 95% of the time with antiviral medications such as sofosbuvir or simeprevir.[1][4] Peginterferon and ribavirin were earlier generation treatments that proved successful in <50% of cases and caused greater side effects.[4]: 2015 version [11] While access to the newer treatments was expensive,  by 2022 prices had dropped dramatically in many countries (primarily low-income and lower-middle-income countries) due to the introduction of generic versions of  medicines.[4] Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant.[5] Hepatitis C is one of the leading reasons for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation.[5]
 An estimated 58 million people worldwide were infected with hepatitis C in 2019. Approximately 290,000 deaths from the virus, mainly from liver cancer and cirrhosis attributed to hepatitis C, also occurred in 2019.[12] The existence of hepatitis C – originally identifiable only as a type of non-A non-B hepatitis – was suggested in the 1970s and proven in 1989.[13] Hepatitis C infects only humans and chimpanzees.[14]
 Acute symptoms develop in some 20% of those infected.[4][1] When this occurs, it is generally 4–12 weeks following infection (but it may take from 2 weeks to 6 months for acute symptoms to appear).[1][4]
 Symptoms are generally mild and vague, and may include fatigue, nausea and vomiting, fever, muscle or joint pains, abdominal pain, decreased appetite and weight loss, jaundice (occurs in ~25% of those infected), dark urine, and clay-coloured stools.[1][15][16] Acute liver failure due to acute hepatitis C is exceedingly rare.[17] Symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of liver disease should prompt further tests and can thus help establish a diagnosis of hepatitis C infection early on.[16]
 Following the acute phase, the infection may resolve spontaneously in 10–50% of affected people; this occurs more frequently in young people and females.[15]
 About 70% of those exposed to the virus develop a chronic infection.[4] This is defined as the presence of detectable viral replication for at least six months. Though most experience minimal or no symptoms during the initial few decades of a chronic infection,[18] chronic hepatitis C can be associated with fatigue[19] and mild cognitive problems.[20] After several years, chronic infection may cause cirrhosis or liver cancer.[5] The liver enzymes measured from blood samples are normal in 7–53%.[21] (Elevated levels indicate liver cells are being damaged by the virus or other disease). Late relapses after apparent cure have been reported, but these can be difficult to distinguish from reinfection.[21]
 Fatty changes to the liver occur in about half of those infected and are usually present before cirrhosis develops.[22][23] Usually (80% of the time) this change affects less than a third of the liver.[22] Worldwide hepatitis C is the cause of 27% of cirrhosis cases and 25% of hepatocellular carcinoma.[24] About 10–30% of those infected develop cirrhosis over 30 years.[5][16] Cirrhosis is more common in those also infected with hepatitis B, schistosoma, or HIV, in alcoholics, and in those of male sex.[16] In those with hepatitis C, excess alcohol increases the risk of developing cirrhosis 5-fold.[25] Those who develop cirrhosis have a 20-fold greater risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. This transformation occurs at a rate of 1–3% per year.[5][16] Being infected with hepatitis B in addition to hepatitis C increases this risk further.[26]
 Liver cirrhosis may lead to portal hypertension, ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdomen), easy bruising or bleeding, varices (enlarged veins, especially in the stomach and esophagus), jaundice, and a syndrome of cognitive impairment known as hepatic encephalopathy.[27] Ascites occurs at some stage in more than half of those who have a chronic infection.[28]
 The most common problem due to hepatitis C but not involving the liver is mixed cryoglobulinemia (usually the type II form) – an inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels.[29][30] Hepatitis C is also associated with autoimmune disorders such as Sjögren's syndrome, lichen planus, a low platelet count, porphyria cutanea tarda, necrolytic acral erythema, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy, autoimmune thyroiditis, and B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.[31][32] 20–30% of people infected have rheumatoid factor – a type of antibody.[33] Possible associations include Hyde's prurigo nodularis[34] and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.[19] Cardiomyopathy with associated abnormal heart rhythms has also been reported.[35] A variety of central and peripheral nervous system disorders has been reported.[36][37] Chronic infection seems to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.[9][38] People may experience other issues in the mouth such as dryness, salivary duct stones, and crusted lesions around the mouth.[39][40][41]
 Persons who have been infected with hepatitis C may appear to clear the virus but remain infected.[42] The virus is not detectable with conventional testing but can be found with ultra-sensitive tests.[43] The original method of detection was by demonstrating the viral genome within liver biopsies, but newer methods include an antibody test for the virus' core protein and the detection of the viral genome after first concentrating the viral particles by ultracentrifugation.[44] A form of infection with persistently moderately elevated serum liver enzymes but without antibodies to hepatitis C has also been reported.[45] This form is known as cryptogenic occult infection.
 Several clinical pictures have been associated with this type of infection.[46] It may be found in people with anti-hepatitis-C antibodies but with normal serum levels of liver enzymes; in antibody-negative people with ongoing elevated liver enzymes of unknown cause; in healthy populations without evidence of liver disease; and in groups at risk for HCV infection including those on hemodialysis or family members of people with occult HCV. The clinical relevance of this form of infection is under investigation.[47] The consequences of occult infection appear to be less severe than with chronic infection but can vary from minimal to hepatocellular carcinoma.[44]
 The rate of occult infection in those apparently cured is controversial but appears to be low.[21] 40% of those with hepatitis but with both negative hepatitis C serology and the absence of detectable viral genome in the serum have hepatitis C virus in the liver on biopsy.[48] How commonly this occurs in children is unknown.[49]
 The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small, enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus.[5] It is a member of the genus Hepacivirus in the family Flaviviridae.[19] There are seven major genotypes of HCV, which are known as genotypes one to seven.[50] The genotypes are divided into several subtypes with the number of subtypes depending on the genotype. In the United States, about 70% of cases are caused by genotype 1, 20% by genotype 2 and about 1% by each of the other genotypes.[16] Genotype 1 is also the most common in South America and Europe.[5]
 The half life of the virus particles in the serum is around 3 hours and may be as short as 45 minutes.[51][52] In an infected person, about 1012 virus particles are produced each day.[51] In addition to replicating in the liver the virus can multiply in lymphocytes.[53]
 Percutaneous contact with contaminated blood is responsible for most infections; however, the method of transmission is strongly dependent on both geographic region and economic status.[54] Indeed, the primary route of transmission in the developed world is injection drug use, while in the developing world the main methods are blood transfusions and unsafe medical procedures.[3] The cause of transmission remains unknown in 20% of cases;[55] however, many of these are believed to be accounted for by injection drug use.[15]
 Tattooing is associated with two to threefold increased risk of hepatitis C.[56] This could be due to either improperly sterilized equipment or contamination of the dyes being used.[56] Tattoos or piercings performed either before the mid-1980s, ""underground"", or nonprofessionally are of particular concern, since sterile techniques in such settings may be lacking. The risk also appears to be greater for larger tattoos.[56] It is estimated that nearly half of prison inmates share unsterilized tattooing equipment.[56] It is rare for tattoos in a licensed facility to be directly associated with HCV infection.[57]
 Injection drug use (IDU) is a major risk factor for hepatitis C in many parts of the world.[59] Of 77 countries reviewed, 25 (including the United States) were found to have a prevalence of hepatitis C of 60–80% among people who use injection drugs.[60][59] Twelve countries had rates greater than 80%.[60] It is believed that ten million intravenous drug users are infected with hepatitis C; China (1.6 million), the United States (1.5 million), and Russia (1.3 million) have the highest absolute totals.[60] Occurrence of hepatitis C among prison inmates in the United States is 10 to 20 times that of the occurrence observed in the general population; this has been attributed to high-risk behavior in prisons such as IDU and tattooing with non-sterile equipment.[61][62] Shared intranasal drug use may also be a risk factor.[63]
 A fomite (/ˈfoʊmaɪt/) or fomes (/ˈfoʊmiːz/) is any inanimate object that, when contaminated with or exposed to infectious agents (such as pathogenic bacteria, viruses or fungi), can transfer disease to a new host.[64]
 Personal-care items such as razors, toothbrushes, and manicuring or pedicuring equipment can be contaminated with blood. Sharing such items can potentially lead to exposure to HCV.[65][66] Appropriate caution should be taken regarding any medical condition that results in bleeding, such as cuts and sores.[66] HCV is not spread through casual contact, such as hugging, kissing, or sharing eating or cooking utensils,[66] nor is it transmitted through food or water.[67]
 Blood transfusion, transfusion of blood products, or organ transplants without HCV screening carry significant risks of infection.[16] The United States instituted universal screening in 1992,[68] and Canada instituted universal screening in 1990.[69] This decreased the risk from one in 200 units[68] to between one in 10,000 to one in 10,000,000 per unit of blood.[15][55] This low risk remains as there is a period of about 11–70 days between the potential blood donor's acquiring hepatitis C and the blood's testing positive depending on the method.[55] Some countries do not screen for hepatitis C due to the cost.[24]
 Those who have experienced a needle stick injury from someone who was HCV positive have about a 1.8% chance of subsequently contracting the disease themselves.[16] The risk is greater if the needle in question is hollow and the puncture wound is deep.[24] There is a risk from mucosal exposures to blood, but this risk is low, and there is no risk if blood exposure occurs on intact skin.[24]
 Hospital equipment has also been documented as a method of transmission of hepatitis C, including reuse of needles and syringes, multiple-use medication vials, infusion bags, and improperly sterilized surgical equipment, among others.[24] Limitations in the implementation and enforcement of stringent standard precautions in public and private medical and dental facilities are known to have been the primary cause of the spread of HCV in Egypt, the country that had the highest rate of infection in the world in 2012, and currently
 Egypt becomes the first country to achieve WHO validation on the path to elimination of hepatitis C.[70]

 Mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C occurs in fewer than 10% of pregnancies.[71] There are no measures that alter this risk.[71] It is not clear when transmission occurs during pregnancy, but it may occur both during gestation and at delivery.[55] A long labor is associated with a greater risk of transmission.[24] There is no evidence that breastfeeding spreads HCV; however, to be cautious, an infected mother is advised to avoid breastfeeding if her nipples are cracked and bleeding,[72] or if her viral loads are high.[55]
 Sexual transmission of hepatitis C is uncommon.[11] Studies examining the risk of HCV transmission between heterosexual partners, when one is infected and the other is not, have found very low risks.[11] Sexual practices that involve higher levels of trauma to the anogenital mucosa, such as anal penetrative sex, or that occur when there is a concurrent sexually transmitted infection, including HIV or genital ulceration, present greater risks.[11][73] The United States Department of Veterans Affairs recommends condom use to prevent hepatitis C transmission in those with multiple partners, but not those in relationships that involve only a single partner.[74]
 There are a number of diagnostic tests for hepatitis C, including HCV antibody enzyme immunoassay (ELISA), recombinant immunoblot assay, and quantitative HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR).[16] HCV RNA can be detected by PCR typically one to two weeks after infection, while antibodies can take substantially longer to form and thus be detected.[27]
 Diagnosing patients is generally a challenge as patients with acute illness generally present with mild, non-specific flu-like symptoms,[75] while the transition from acute to chronic is sub-clinical.[76] Chronic hepatitis C is defined as infection with the hepatitis C virus persisting for more than six months based on the presence of its RNA.[18] Chronic infections are typically asymptomatic during the first few decades,[18] and thus are most commonly discovered following the investigation of elevated liver enzyme levels or during a routine screening of high-risk individuals. Testing is not able to distinguish between acute and chronic infections.[24] Diagnosis in infants is difficult as maternal antibodies may persist for up to 18 months.[49]
 Hepatitis C testing typically begins with blood testing to detect the presence of antibodies to the HCV, using an enzyme immunoassay.[16] If this test is positive, a confirmatory test is then performed to verify the immunoassay and to determine the viral load.[16] A recombinant immunoblot assay is used to verify the immunoassay and the viral load is determined by an HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction.[16] If there is no RNA and the immunoblot is positive, it means that the person tested had a previous infection but cleared it either with treatment or spontaneously; if the immunoblot is negative, it means that the immunoassay was wrong.[16] It takes about 6–8 weeks following infection before the immunoassay will test positive.[19] A number of tests are available as point-of-care testing (POCT), which can provide results within 30 minutes.[77]
 Liver enzymes are variable during the initial part of the infection[18] and on average begin to rise at seven weeks after infection.[19] The elevation of liver enzymes does not closely follow disease severity.[19]
 Liver biopsies are used to determine the degree of liver damage present; however, there are risks from the procedure.[5] The typical changes seen are lymphocytes within the parenchyma, lymphoid follicles in portal triad, and changes to the bile ducts.[5] There are a number of blood tests available that try to determine the degree of hepatic fibrosis and alleviate the need for biopsy.[5]
 It is believed that only 5–50% of those infected in the United States and Canada are aware of their status.[56] Routine screening for those between the ages of 18 and 79 was recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2020.[8] Previously, testing was recommended for those at high risk, including injection drug users, those who have received blood transfusions before 1992,[63] those who have been incarcerated, those on long-term hemodialysis,[63] and those with tattoos.[56] Screening is also recommended for those with elevated liver enzymes, as this is frequently the only sign of chronic hepatitis.[78] As of 2012[update], the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a single screening test for those born between 1945 and 1965.[79][80][81][82] In Canada, a one-time screening is recommended for those born between 1945 and 1975.[83]
 As of 2022, no approved vaccine protects against contracting hepatitis C.[84] A combination of harm reduction strategies, such as the provision of new needles and syringes and treatment of substance use, decreases the risk of hepatitis C in people using injection drugs by about 75%.[85] The screening of blood donors is important at a national level, as is adhering to universal precautions within healthcare facilities.[19] In countries where there is an insufficient supply of sterile syringes, medications should be given orally rather than via injection (when possible).[24] Recent research also suggests that treating people with active infection, thereby reducing the potential for transmission, may be an effective preventive measure.[10]
 Hepatitis C vaccine phase 1 clinical trials are set to begin in the summer of 2023.[86]
 Those with chronic hepatitis C are advised to avoid alcohol and medications that are toxic to the liver.[16] They should also be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B due to the increased risk if also infected.[16] Use of acetaminophen is generally considered safe at reduced doses.[11] Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not recommended in those with advanced liver disease due to an increased risk of bleeding.[11] Ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma is recommended in those with accompanying cirrhosis.[16] Coffee consumption has been associated with[vague] a slower rate of liver scarring in those infected with HCV.[11]
 More than 95% of chronic cases clear with treatment.[4] Treatment with antiviral medication is recommended for all people with proven chronic hepatitis C who are not at high risk of death from other causes.[87] People with the highest complication risk, which is based on the degree of liver scarring, should be treated first.[87] The initial recommended treatment depends on the type of hepatitis C virus, if the person has received previous hepatitis C treatment, and whether the person has cirrhosis.[88] Direct-acting antivirals are the preferred treatment and have been validated by testing for virus particles in patients' blood.[89]
 More than 95% of people with chronic infection can be cured when treated with medications;[101] this could be expensive, but by 2022 prices had dropped dramatically.[4] The combination of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir may be used in those who have previously been treated with sofosbuvir or other drugs that inhibit NS5A and were not cured.[102]
 Prior to 2011, treatments consisted of a combination of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin for a period of 24 or 48 weeks, depending on HCV genotype.[16] This treatment produces cure rates of 70–80% for genotype 2 and 3, respectively, and 45–70% for genotypes 1 and 4.[103] Adverse effects with these treatments were common, with 50–60% of those being treated experiencing flu-like symptoms and nearly a third experiencing depression or other emotional issues.[16] Treatment during the first six months of infection (the acute stage) is more effective than when hepatitis C has entered the chronic stage.[27] In those with chronic hepatitis B, treatment for hepatitis C results in reactivation of hepatitis B about 25% of the time.[104]
 Cirrhosis due to hepatitis C is a common reason for liver transplantation,[27] though the virus usually (80–90% of cases) recurs afterwards.[5][105] Infection of the graft leads to 10–30% of people developing cirrhosis within five years.[106] Treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin post-transplant decreases the risk of recurrence to 70%.[107] A 2013 review found no clear evidence as to whether antiviral medication is useful if the graft became reinfected.[108]
 Several alternative therapies are claimed by their proponents to be helpful for hepatitis C, including milk thistle, ginseng, and colloidal silver.[109] However, no alternative therapy has been shown to improve outcomes for hepatitis C patients, and no evidence exists that alternative therapies have any effect on the virus.[109][110][111]
 
 The responses to treatment is measured by sustained viral response (SVR), defined as the absence of detectable RNA of the hepatitis C virus in blood serum for at least 24 weeks after discontinuing treatment,[112] and rapid virological response (RVR), defined as undetectable levels achieved within four weeks of treatment. Successful treatment decreases the future risk of hepatocellular carcinoma by 75%.[113]
 Prior to 2012, sustained response occurred in about 40–50% of those with HCV genotype 1 who received 48 weeks of treatment.[5] A sustained response was seen in 70–80% of people with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 following 24 weeks of treatment.[5] A sustained response occurs for about 65% of those with genotype 4 after 48 weeks of treatment. For those with HCV genotype 6, a 48-week treatment protocol of pegylated interferon and ribavirin results in a higher rate of sustained responses than for genotype 1 (86% vs. 52%). Further studies are needed to determine results for shorter 24-week treatments and for those given at lower dosages.[114]
 Around 30% (15–45%) of those with acute HCV infections will spontaneously clear the virus within six months, before the infection is considered chronic.[4] Spontaneous resolution following acute infection appears more common in females and in patients who are younger, and may be influenced by certain genetic factors.[15] Chronic HCV infection may also resolve spontaneously months or years after the acute phase has passed, though this is unusual.[15]
 The World Health Organization estimated in a 2021 report that 58 million people globally were living with chronic hepatitis C as of 2019.[12] About 1.5 million people are infected per year, and about 290,000 people die yearly from hepatitis C–related diseases, mainly from liver cancer and cirrhosis.[4]
 Hepatitis C infection rates increased substantially in the 20th century due to a combination of intravenous drug abuse and the reuse of poorly sterilized medical equipment.[24] However, advancements in treatment have led to notable declines in chronic infections and deaths from the virus. As a result, the number of chronic patients receiving treatment worldwide has grown from about 950,000 in 2015 to 9.4 million in 2019. During the same period, hepatitis C deaths declined from about 400,000 to 290,000.[4][12]
 Previously, a 2013 study found high infection rates (>3.5% population infected) in Central and East Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, intermediate infection rates (1.5–3.5%) in South and Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Andean, Central and Southern Latin America, Caribbean, Oceania, Australasia and Central, Eastern and Western Europe; and low infection rates (<1.5%) in Asia-Pacific, Tropical Latin America and North America.[115]
 Among those chronically infected, the risk of cirrhosis after 20 years varies between studies but has been estimated at ~10–15% for men and ~1–5% for women. The reason for this difference is not known. Once cirrhosis is established, the rate of developing hepatocellular carcinoma is ~1–4% per year.[116] Rates of new infections have decreased in the Western world since the 1990s due to improved screening of blood before transfusion.[27]
 In Egypt, following Egypt's 2030 Vision, the country managed to bring down the infection rates of hepatitis C from 22% in 2011 to just 2% in 2021.[117] It was believed that the high prevalence in Egypt was linked to a discontinued mass-treatment campaign for schistosomiasis, using improperly sterilized glass syringes.[24]
 In the United States, about 2% of people have chronic hepatitis C.[16] In 2014, an estimated 30,500 new acute hepatitis C cases occurred (0.7 per 100,000 population), an increase from 2010 to 2012.[118] The number of deaths from hepatitis C has increased to 15,800 in 2008[119] having overtaken HIV/AIDS as a cause of death in the US in 2007.[120] In 2014, it was the single greatest cause of infectious death in the United States.[121] This mortality rate is expected to increase, as those infected by transfusion before HCV testing become apparent.[122] In Europe, the percentage of people with chronic infections has been estimated to be between 0.13 and 3.26%.[123]
 In the United Kingdom, about 118,000 people were chronically infected in 2019.[124] About half of people using a needle exchange in London in 2017–18 tested positive for hepatitis C of which half were unaware that they had it.[125] As part of a bid to eradicate hepatitis C by 2025, NHS England conducted a large procurement exercise in 2019. Merck Sharp & Dohme, Gilead Sciences, and Abbvie were awarded contracts, which, together, are worth up to £1 billion over five years.[126]
 The total number of people with this infection is higher in some countries in Africa and Asia.[127] Countries with particularly high rates of infection include Pakistan (4.8%) and China (3.2%).[128]
 Since 2014, extremely effective treatments have been available to eradicate the disease within 8–12 weeks in most people.[129] In 2015, about 950,000 people were treated while 1.7 million new infections occurred, meaning that overall the number of people with HCV increased.[129] These numbers differ by country and improved in 2016, with some countries achieving higher cure rates than new infection rates (mostly high income countries).[129] By 2018, twelve countries are on track to achieve HCV elimination.[129] While antiviral agents will curb new infections, it is less clear whether they impact overall deaths and morbidity.[129] Furthermore, for them to be effective, people need to be aware of their infection – it is estimated that worldwide only 20% of infected people are aware of their infection (in the US, fewer than half were aware).[129]
 In the mid-1970s, Harvey J. Alter, Chief of the Infectious Disease Section in the Department of Transfusion Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, and his research team demonstrated how most post-transfusion hepatitis cases were not due to hepatitis A or B viruses. Despite this discovery, international research efforts to identify the virus, initially called non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH), failed for the next decade. In 1987, Michael Houghton, Qui-Lim Choo, and George Kuo at Chiron Corporation, collaborating with Daniel W. Bradley at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, used a novel molecular cloning approach to identify the unknown organism and develop a diagnostic test.[130] In 1988, Alter confirmed the virus by verifying its presence in a panel of NANBH specimens, and Chiron announced its discovery at a Washington, D.C. press conference in May 1988.
 At the time, Chiron was in talks with the Japanese health ministry to sell a biotech version of the hepatitis B vaccine. Simultaneously, Emperor Hirohito had developed cancer and required numerous blood transfusions. The Japanese health ministry placed a screening order for Chiron's experimental NANBH test. Chiron's Japanese marketing subsidiary, Diagnostic Systems KK, introduced the term ""Hepatitis C"" in November 1988 in Tokyo news reports publicizing the testing of the emperor's blood.[131] Chiron sold a screening order to the Japanese health ministry in November 1988, earning the company US$60 million a year. However, because Chiron had not published any of its research and did not make a culture model available to other researchers to verify Chiron's discovery, hepatitis C earned the nickname ""The Emperor's New Virus.""
 In April 1989, the ""discovery"" of HCV was published in two articles in the journal Science.[132][133] Chiron filed for several patents on the virus and its diagnosis.[134] A competing patent application by the CDC was dropped in 1990 after Chiron paid $1.9 million to the CDC and $337,500 to Bradley. In 1994, Bradley sued Chiron, seeking to invalidate the patent, have himself included as a co-inventor, and receive damages and royalty income. The court ruled against him, which was sustained on appeal in 1998.[135]
Because of the unique molecular ""isolation"" of the hepatitis C virus, although Houghton and Kuo's team at Chiron had discovered strong biochemical markers for the virus and the test proved effective at reducing cases of post-transfusion hepatitis, the existence of a hepatitis C virus was essentially inferred.[136] In 1992, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the virus had never been observed under an electron microscope.[137] In 1997, the American FDA approved the first hepatitis C drug on the basis of a surrogate marker called ""Sustained Virological Response."" In response, the pharmaceutical industry established a nationwide network of ""Astro-Turf"" patient advocacy groups to raise awareness (and fear) of the disease.[138]
 Hepatitis C was finally ""discovered"" in 2005 when a Japanese team was able to propagate a molecular clone in a cell culture called Huh7.[139] This discovery enabled proper characterization of the viral particle and rapid research into the development of protease inhibitors replacing early interferon treatments. The first of these, sofosbuvir, was approved on December 6, 2013. These drugs are marketed as ""cures;"" however, because they were approved on the basis of surrogate markers and not clinical endpoints such as prolonging life or improving liver health, many experts question their value.[140][141]
 After blood screening began, a notable hepatitis C prevalence was discovered in Egypt, which claimed six million individuals were infected by unsterile needles in a late 1970s mass chemotherapy campaign to eliminate schistosomiasis (snail fever).[142]
 On October 5, 2020, Houghton and Alter, together with Charles M. Rice, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work.[143][144]
 World Hepatitis Day, held on July 28, is coordinated by the World Hepatitis Alliance.[145] The economic costs of hepatitis C are significant both to the individual and to society. In the United States, the average lifetime cost of the disease was estimated at US$33,407 in 2003[146] with the cost of a liver transplant as of 2011[update] costing approximately US$200,000.[147] In Canada, the cost of a course of antiviral treatment is as high as 30,000 CAD in 2003,[148] while the United States costs are between 9,200 and US$17,600 in 1998.[146] In many areas of the world, people are unable to afford treatment with antivirals as they either lack insurance coverage or the insurance they have will not pay for antivirals.[149] In the English National Health Service treatment rates for hepatitis C were higher among less deprived groups in 2010–2012.[150]
 Hepatitis C–infected Spanish anaesthetist Juan Maeso was jailed for the maximum possible period of 20 years for infecting 275 patients between 1988 and 1997, as he used the same needles to give both himself and the patients opioids.[151][152]
 Compared with adults, infection in children is much less understood. Worldwide the prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in pregnant women and children has been estimated to 1–8% and 0.05–5% respectively.[153] The vertical transmission rate has been estimated to be 3–5% and there is a high rate of spontaneous clearance (25–50%) in the children. Higher rates have been reported for both vertical transmission (18%, 6–36%, and 41%)[154][155] and prevalence in children (15%).[156]
 In developed countries, transmission around the time of birth is now the leading cause of HCV infection. In the absence of virus in the mother's blood, transmission seems to be rare.[155] Factors associated with an increased rate of infection include membrane rupture of longer than 6 hours before delivery and procedures exposing the infant to maternal blood.[157] Cesarean sections are not recommended. Breastfeeding is considered safe if the nipples are not damaged. Infection around the time of birth in one child does not increase the risk in a subsequent pregnancy. All genotypes appear to have the same risk of transmission.
 HCV infection is frequently found in children who have previously been presumed to have non-A, non-B hepatitis and cryptogenic liver disease.[158] The presentation in childhood may be asymptomatic or with elevated liver function tests.[159] While infection is commonly asymptomatic, both cirrhosis with liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma may occur in childhood.
 The rate of hepatitis C in immunosuppressed people is higher. This is particularly true in those with human immunodeficiency virus infection, recipients of organ transplants, and those with hypogammaglobulinemia.[160] Infection in these people is associated with an unusually rapid progression to cirrhosis. People with stable HIV who never received medication for HCV, may be treated with a combination of peginterferon plus ribavirin with caution to the possible side effects.[161]
 As of 2011[update], there are about one hundred medications in development for hepatitis C.[147] These include vaccines to treat hepatitis, immunomodulators, and cyclophilin inhibitors, among others.[162] These potential new treatments have come about due to a better understanding of the hepatitis C virus.[163] There are a number of vaccines under development and some have shown encouraging results.[164]
 The combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir in one trial (reported in 2015) resulted in cure rates of 99%.[165] More studies are needed to investigate the role of the preventive antiviral medication against HCV recurrence after transplantation.[166]
 One barrier to finding treatments for hepatitis C is the lack of a suitable animal model. Despite moderate success, research highlights the need for pre-clinical testing in mammalian systems such as mouse, particularly for the development of vaccines in poorer communities. Chimpanzees remain the only available living system to study, yet their use has ethical concerns and regulatory restrictions. While scientists have made use of human cell culture systems such as hepatocytes, questions have been raised about their accuracy in reflecting the body's response to infection.[167]
 One aspect of hepatitis research is to reproduce infections in mammalian models. A strategy is to introduce liver tissues from humans into mice, a technique known as xenotransplantation. This is done by generating chimeric mice and exposing the mice to HCV infection. This engineering process is known to create humanized mice, and provide opportunities to study hepatitis C within the 3D architectural design of the liver and evaluating antiviral compounds.[167] Alternatively, generating inbred mice with susceptibility to HCV would simplify the process of studying mouse models.

 Hepatitis C is a virus that can infect the liver. If left untreated, it can sometimes cause serious and potentially life-threatening damage to the liver over many years. But with modern treatments, it's usually possible to cure the infection, and most people with it will have a normal life expectancy. It's estimated around 118,000 people in the UK had chronic hepatitis C in 2019. You can become infected with it if you come into contact with the blood of an infected person. Hepatitis C often does not have any noticeable symptoms until the liver has been significantly damaged. This means many people have the infection without realising it. When symptoms do occur, they can be mistaken for another condition. Symptoms can include: The only way to know for certain if these symptoms are caused by hepatitis C is to get tested. The hepatitis C virus is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact. Some ways the infection can be spread include: In the UK, most hepatitis C infections happen in people who inject drugs or have injected them in the past. It's estimated around half of those who inject drugs have been infected with the virus. If you received a blood transfusion or blood products before 1996, there's a chance you may have been infected with hepatitis C. If you have contracted hepatitis C from infected blood help and support is available. Find out more about support for people who may have been affected by infected blood. Seek medical advice if you have persistent symptoms of hepatitis C or there's a risk you're infected, even if you do not have any symptoms. A blood test can be carried out to see if you have the infection. You can do a finger-prick test at home to find out if you have hepatitis C. GPs, sexual health clinics, genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics or drug treatment services also offer testing for hepatitis C. Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent or limit any damage to your liver, as well as help ensure the infection is not passed on to other people. Find out how to get a free home test for hepatitis C Find out more about testing for hepatitis C Hepatitis C can be treated with medicines that stop the virus multiplying inside the body. These usually need to be taken for several weeks. Until recently, most people would have taken 2 main medicines called pegylated interferon (a weekly injection) and ribavirin (a capsule or tablet). Tablet-only treatments are now available. These new hepatitis C medicines have been found to make treatment more effective, are easier to tolerate, and have shorter treatment courses. They include sofosbuvir and daclatasvir. Using the latest medications, more than 90% of people with hepatitis C may be cured. But it's important to be aware that you will not be immune to the infection and should take steps to reduce your risk of becoming infected again. If the infection is left untreated for many years, some people with hepatitis C will develop scarring of the liver (cirrhosis).  Over time, this can cause the liver to stop working properly. In severe cases, life-threatening problems, such as liver failure, where the liver loses most or all of its functions, or liver cancer, can eventually develop. Treating hepatitis C as early as possible can help reduce the risk of these problems happening. Find out more about the complications of hepatitis C There's no vaccine for hepatitis C, but there are ways to reduce your risk of becoming infected. These include: The risk of getting hepatitis C through sex is very low. But it may be higher if blood is present, such as menstrual blood or from minor bleeding during anal sex. Condoms are not usually necessary to prevent hepatitis C for long-term heterosexual couples, but it's a good idea to use them when having anal sex or sex with a new partner.

"Hepatitis C is a virus that causes chronic liver inflammation and long-term damage. Transmission commonly occurs through infected needles. HCV is treatable with new antiviral medications, but many people don’t know they’re infected. They may not have symptoms until liver disease has progressed to liver failure. Hepatitis C is a viral infection that affects your liver. It causes inflammation and swelling, which damages your liver tissues over time. “Hepatitis” means inflammation of the liver. There are many causes of hepatitis, and a few of them are viruses. Compared to other causes of viral hepatitis, though, hepatitis C is much more likely to stay in your body for a long time. Chronic inflammation over many years does serious damage to your liver. In fact, hepatitis C is one of the leading causes of liver failure and liver transplantation in the United States. Most people can’t tell when their liver is inflamed. They don’t develop symptoms until severe damage has already been done. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Rates of hepatitis C infection in the U.S. have nearly quadrupled in the last decade. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 4 million people in the United States today may have hepatitis C. Many are unaware. The CDC now recommends that all U.S. adults be screened for hepatitis C. Worldwide, the estimated number of infections is 60 million. Hepatitis C is caused by a virus that spreads through contact with blood. Transmission occurs when the blood of an infected person enters the body of an uninfected person. In the U.S., it most commonly occurs when people share needles for injecting intravenous drugs. Worldwide, transmission commonly occurs in medical settings with unsterilized equipment. Advertisement Hepatitis A and hepatitis B are different viruses that also cause hepatitis. They differ in the ways they’re contracted and spread, the types of infections they cause and the ways that you can treat them and prevent them. Here are some of the key differences:  Hepatitis C infection has several stages. When you first get a virus, it goes through what’s called an incubation period. This is when it’s busy replicating itself in your body. The virus keeps replicating until it reaches the threshold where your body recognizes the infection. Then your immune system kicks in, and that’s when you begin to notice symptoms. With hepatitis C, the incubation period can last from two weeks to six months. The acute stage of infection begins when your immune system kicks in. It’s also when you begin to experience symptoms. Most viral infections at the acute stage cause symptoms of illness, such as fever and inflammation in your body. With hepatitis, though, the inflammation is mainly in your liver, and you might not notice it. Only 20% of people with acute hepatitis C infection have symptoms. People who have symptoms can treat the infection with antivirals. But most don’t have symptoms and don’t know to seek treatment. The acute stage lasts up to three months. Within this period, up to 20% of people effectively fight off the virus and spontaneously clear it from their bodies. Most people (80%) are unable to clear the virus by themselves and develop a long-term, chronic infection. This means that their livers are constantly inflamed and swollen. Chronic hepatitis causes liver damage by a process known as cirrhosis. The constant inflammation of the liver eventually leads to scarring. Cirrhosis progresses slowly over several decades. It might go faster if you have additional liver damage from other causes, such as excessive alcohol use. It might go slower if your liver is in better condition overall. But the end result is that scar tissue prevents your liver from doing its job. The risk of cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis C infection is about 25% after 20 years. Advertisement The hepatitis C virus (HCV) spreads through contact with blood. Transmission occurs when the blood of an infected person enters the body of an uninfected person. In the U.S., the most common way this happens is by sharing needles for injecting intravenous drugs. But there are all sorts of accidental ways that you might come into contact with another person’s blood. For example: Before 1992, hepatitis C was commonly spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants. Now, healthcare providers routinely screen for the virus before using donated blood or organs. While it’s no longer a risk from these causes, healthcare providers recommend that everyone who did receive a transfusion or transplant before 1992 get tested for HCV. In the U.S., you’re more likely to be infected with hepatitis C if you: Most people don’t have any symptoms. A small number may have symptoms during the acute stage of infection. They may be vague, flu-like symptoms, or they may be like the symptoms of liver disease, including stomach pain and jaundice. Much later on, you may begin to notice symptoms of late-stage liver disease when your liver is beginning to fail. Acute symptoms of hepatitis C infection may resemble flu symptoms, such as: They may also resemble the symptoms of acute liver failure, such as: If you don’t have early warning symptoms, you may have late warning symptoms of hepatitis when you begin to experience the effects of cirrhosis after many years of chronic infection. You may have all of the symptoms above, and may also notice: Screening for hepatitis C infection begins with a simple blood test. Your healthcare provider will draw a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm and send it to the lab for testing. If you’ve been infected with the virus, your blood sample will have antibodies against hepatitis C. If you test positive for antibodies, your healthcare provider will follow up with additional blood tests. A blood test called an RNA PCR test looks for evidence of the actual virus in your blood, not just the antibodies. This test is necessary to confirm that you’re still infected. You might still have antibodies even if you’ve spontaneously cleared the virus. Your provider can also use this test to measure the quantity of the virus in your blood and to find out which strain you have. If you test positive for chronic hepatitis C infection, your healthcare provider will want to assess your liver for damage. They’ll want to know how much of your liver tissue has turned to scar tissue. Tests to evaluate the health of your liver may include: It doesn’t usually go away without treatment, but occasionally it does. If you’re among the few who are able to spontaneously clear the virus, this will happen during the acute stage of infection. The acute stage is when your immune system launches its initial attack on the virus. It lasts up to three months. If it succeeds, you won’t develop a chronic infection. If you do have a chronic infection, it means that the virus has outwitted your immune system and you’ll need help to clear it. Fortunately, recent advances in antiviral medications have made this possible. New antivirals can cure chronic hepatitis C infection in 95–98% of cases, within eight to 24 weeks. Due to their side effects, they may not be suitable for everyone. There are a variety of medications now available to treat hepatitis C. Different medications are recommended to treat different strains of the virus. The length of treatment may depend on your overall condition and the strain (or genotype) you have. Some respond better to treatment than others. Medications approved for the treatment of hepatitis C include: If you already have advanced liver disease (cirrhosis), curing the infection may not be enough. You may already be on the threshold of liver failure. The only cure for liver failure is liver transplantation. If your healthcare provider determines that you need a new liver, you’ll have to join the waiting list. In the meantime, curing hepatitis C is still important to protect the health of your new liver. There’s currently no effective vaccine to prevent hepatitis C. Although researchers have been working on it for a long time, hepatitis C has proven difficult to prevent because it has many variations and mutates rapidly. The only effective way to prevent hepatitis C infection is to avoid contact with infected blood. In particular, don’t share needles or syringes. New medications for hepatitis C have made the prognosis (outlook) brighter. Even if you’ve had a chronic infection for many years, you can treat it and, in most cases, cure it in a matter of weeks. However, some people may have extensive liver damage before they ever seek treatment. There’s no way of knowing how your liver is doing without taking some tests. A note from Cleveland Clinic Everyone should be screened at least once for hepatitis C infection. It’s a simple blood test that could provide life-changing information about your health. Risky behaviors such as intravenous drug use put you at higher risk. But when overall infection rates are high and many people don’t know they’re infected, it’s not impossible for anyone to have the virus. The good news is that hepatitis C is curable. You can prevent significant liver damage by catching and treating the infection earlier than later. Don’t wait for symptoms, which may never occur, or may only occur when it’s too late. Knowledge is power, and even with advanced liver disease, there are steps you can take to control the damage and preserve your liver. Last reviewed on 12/09/2022.

 Hepatitis is the term used to describe inflammation of the liver. It's usually the result of a viral infection or liver damage caused by drinking alcohol. There are several different types of hepatitis. Some types will pass without any serious problems, while others can be long-lasting (chronic) and cause scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), loss of liver function and, in some cases, liver cancer. Short-term (acute) hepatitis often has no noticeable symptoms, so you may not realise you have it. If symptoms do develop, they can include: See your GP if you have any persistent or troublesome symptoms that you think could be caused by hepatitis. Long-term (chronic) hepatitis also may not have any obvious symptoms until the liver stops working properly (liver failure) and may only be picked up during blood tests. In the later stages it can cause jaundice, swelling in the legs, ankles and feet, confusion, and blood in your stools or vomit. Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus. It's usually caught by consuming food and drink contaminated with the poo of an infected person, and is most common in countries where sanitation is poor. Hepatitis A usually passes within a few months, although it can occasionally be severe and even life threatening. There's no specific treatment for it, other than to relieve symptoms like pain, nausea and itching. Vaccination against hepatitis A is recommended if: Find out more about hepatitis A Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus, which is spread in the blood of an infected person. It's a common infection worldwide and is usually spread from infected pregnant women to their babies, or from child-to-child contact. It can also be spread through unprotected sex and injecting drugs. Hepatitis B is uncommon in the UK. It most commonly affects people who became infected while growing up in part of the world where the infection is more common, such as southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Most adults infected with hepatitis B are able to fight off the virus and fully recover from the infection within a couple of months. But most people infected as children develop a long-term infection. This is known as chronic hepatitis B, and can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Antiviral medicine can be used to treat it. In the UK, vaccination against hepatitis B is recommended for people in high-risk groups, such as: Hepatitis B vaccination is also part of the routine immunisation programme so all children can benefit from protection from this virus. Find out more about hepatitis B Hepatitis C is caused by the hepatitis C virus. It's usually spread through blood-to-blood contact with an infected person. In the UK, it's most commonly spread through sharing needles used to inject drugs. Poor healthcare practices and unsafe medical injections are the main way it's spread outside the UK. Hepatitis C often causes no noticeable symptoms, or only flu-like symptoms, so many people are unaware they're infected. Some people will fight off the infection and be free of the virus. In other cases, it'll stay in the body for many years. This is known as chronic hepatitis C and can cause cirrhosis and liver failure. Chronic hepatitis C can be treated with very effective antiviral medicines, but there's currently no vaccine available. Find out more about hepatitis C Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus. It only affects people who are already infected with hepatitis B, as it needs the hepatitis B virus to be able to survive in the body. Hepatitis D is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact or sexual contact. It's uncommon in the UK, but is more widespread in other parts of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and South America. Long-term infection with hepatitis D and hepatitis B can increase your risk of developing serious problems, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. There's no vaccine specifically for hepatitis D, but the hepatitis B vaccine can help protect you from it. Hepatitis E is caused by the hepatitis E virus. The number of cases in Europe has increased in recent years and it's now the most common cause of short-term (acute) hepatitis in the UK. The virus has been mainly associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked pork meat or offal, but also with wild boar meat, venison and shellfish.  Hepatitis E is generally a mild and short-term infection that does not require any treatment, but it can be serious in some people, such as those who have a weakened immune system. There's no vaccine for hepatitis E. When travelling to parts of the world with poor sanitation, where epidemic hepatitis E may be common, you can reduce your risk by practising good food and water hygiene measures. The British Liver Trust has more information about hepatitis E Alcoholic hepatitis is a type of hepatitis caused by drinking excessive amounts of alcohol over many years. The condition is common in the UK and many people do not realise they have it. This is because it does not usually cause any symptoms, although it can cause sudden jaundice and liver failure in some people. Stopping drinking will usually allow your liver to recover, but there's a risk you could eventually develop cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer if you continue to drink alcohol excessively. You can reduce your risk of developing alcoholic hepatitis by controlling how much you drink. It's recommended that you do not regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week. Read more about alcohol-related liver disease and the health risks associated with alcohol. Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare cause of long-term hepatitis where the immune system attacks and damages the liver. Eventually, the liver can become so damaged that it stops working properly. Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis involves very effective medicines that suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. It's not clear what causes autoimmune hepatitis and it's not known whether anything can be done to prevent it. The British Liver Trust has more information about autoimmune hepatitis

"Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. It may be caused by viral infection, alcohol consumption, several health conditions, or even some medications. Treatment varies based on the type and underlying cause.  Hepatitis refers to an inflammatory condition of the liver. It is commonly the result of a viral infection, but there are other possible causes of hepatitis. These include autoimmune hepatitis and hepatitis that occurs as a secondary result of medications, drugs, toxins, and alcohol. Autoimmune hepatitis is a disease that occurs when your body makes antibodies against your liver tissue. The five main viral classifications of hepatitis are hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. A different virus is responsible for each type of viral hepatitis. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 354 million people currently live with chronic hepatitis B and C globally. Hepatitis A is the result of an infection with the hepatitis A virus (HAV). This type of hepatitis is an acute, short-term disease. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes hepatitis B. This is often an ongoing, chronic condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that around 826,000 people are living with chronic hepatitis B in the United States and around 257 million people worldwide. Hepatitis C comes from the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is among the most common bloodborne viral infections in the United States and typically presents as a long-term condition. According to the CDC, approximately 2.4 million Americans are currently living with a chronic form of this infection. This is a rare form of hepatitis that only occurs in conjunction with hepatitis B infection. The hepatitis D virus (HDV) causes liver inflammation like other strains, but a person cannot contract HDV without an existing hepatitis B infection. Globally, HDV affects almost 5 percent of people with chronic hepatitis B. Hepatitis E is a waterborne disease that results from exposure to the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E is mainly found in areas with poor sanitation and typically results from ingesting fecal matter that contaminates the water supply.  This disease is uncommon in the United States, according to the CDC. Hepatitis E is usually acute but can be particularly dangerous in pregnant women. Although hepatitis is most commonly the result of an infection, other factors can cause the condition. Excess alcohol consumption can cause liver damage and inflammation. This may also be referred to as alcoholic hepatitis. The alcohol directly injures the cells of your liver. Over time, it can cause permanent damage and lead to thickening or scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis) and liver failure. Other toxic causes of hepatitis include misuse of medications and exposure to toxins. In some cases, the immune system mistakes the liver as harmful and attacks it. This causes ongoing inflammation that can range from mild to severe, often hindering liver function. It’s three times more common in women than in men. If you are living with a chronic form of hepatitis, like hepatitis B and C, you may not show symptoms until the damage affects liver function. By contrast, people with acute hepatitis may present with symptoms shortly after contracting a hepatitis virus. Common symptoms of infectious hepatitis include: It is crucial to understand what is causing hepatitis in order to treat it correctly. Doctors will progress through a series of tests to accurately diagnose your condition. To diagnose all forms of hepatitis, your doctor will first take your history to determine any risk factors you may have. During a physical examination, your doctor may press down gently on your abdomen to see if there’s pain or tenderness. Your doctor may also check for any swelling of the liver and any yellow discoloration in your eyes or skin. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here. Liver function tests use blood samples to determine how efficiently your liver works. Abnormal results of these tests may be the first indication that there is a problem, especially if you don’t show any signs on a physical exam of liver disease. High liver enzyme levels may indicate that your liver is stressed, damaged, or not functioning correctly. If your liver function tests are abnormal, your doctor will likely order other blood tests to detect the source of the problem. These tests can determine if you have infectious hepatitis by checking for the presence of hepatitis viruses or antibodies your body produces to combat them. Doctors may also use blood tests to check for any signs of autoimmune hepatitis. When diagnosing hepatitis, doctors will also assess your liver for potential damage. A liver biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a sample of tissue from your liver. A medical professional may take this sample through your skin with a needle, meaning there is no need for surgery. They will typically use an ultrasound scan for guidance during this procedure. This test allows your doctor to determine how infection or inflammation has affected your liver. An abdominal ultrasound uses ultrasound waves to create an image of the organs within your abdomen. This test allows your doctor to take a close look at your liver and nearby organs. It can reveal: Sometimes the pancreas shows up on ultrasound images as well. This can be a useful test in determining the cause of your abnormal liver function. Treatment options will vary by the type of hepatitis you have and whether the infection is acute or chronic. Hepatitis A is a short-term illness and may not require treatment. However, if symptoms cause a great deal of discomfort, bed rest may be necessary. In addition, if you experience vomiting or diarrhea, your doctor may recommend a dietary program to maintain your hydration and nutrition. There is no specific treatment program for acute hepatitis B. However, if you have chronic hepatitis B, you will require antiviral medications. This form of treatment can be costly, as you may have to continue it for several months or years. Treatment for chronic hepatitis B also requires regular medical evaluations and monitoring to determine if the virus is responding to treatment. Antiviral medications can treat both acute and chronic forms of hepatitis C. Typically, people who develop chronic hepatitis C will use a combination of antiviral drug therapies. They may also need further testing to determine the best form of treatment. People who develop cirrhosis or liver disease due to chronic hepatitis C may be candidates for a liver transplant. The WHO lists pegylated interferon alpha as a treatment for hepatitis D. However, this medication can have severe side effects. As a result, it’s not recommended for people with cirrhosis liver damage, those with psychiatric conditions, and people with autoimmune diseases. Currently, no specific medical therapies are available to treat hepatitis E. Because the infection is often acute, it typically resolves on its own. Doctors will typically advise people with this infection to get adequate rest, drink plenty of fluids, get enough nutrients, and avoid alcohol. However, pregnant women who develop this infection require close monitoring and care. Corticosteroids, like prednisone or budesonide, are extremely important in the early treatment of autoimmune hepatitis. They’re effective in about 80 percent of people with this condition. Azathioprine (Imuran), a drug that suppresses the immune system, may also be a part of treatment programs. People may use this with or without steroids. Other immune-suppressing drugs like mycophenolate (CellCept), tacrolimus (Prograf), and cyclosporine (Neoral) can also replace azathioprine in treatment. There are vaccines that can help protect against many hepatitis viruses. Minimizing your risk of exposure to substances containing these viruses can also be an important preventive measure. A vaccine for hepatitis A is available and can help prevent the contraction of HAV. The hepatitis A vaccine is a series of two doses and most children begin vaccination at age 12 to 23 months. This is also available for adults and can also include the hepatitis B vaccine. The CDC recommends hepatitis B vaccinations for all newborns. Doctors typically administer the series of three vaccines over the first 6 months of childhood. The CDC also recommends the vaccine for all healthcare and medical personnel. Vaccination against hepatitis B can also prevent hepatitis D. There are currently no vaccines for hepatitis C or E. Hepatitis viruses can transmit from person to person through contact with bodily fluids, water, and foods containing infectious agents. Minimizing your risk of contact with these substances can help to prevent contracting hepatitis viruses. Practicing effective hygiene is one way to avoid contracting hepatitis A and E. The viruses that cause these conditions can be present in water. If you’re traveling to a country where there is a high prevalence of hepatitis, you should avoid: The hepatitis B, C, and D viruses can transmit through contact with bodily fluids containing these infectious agents. You can reduce your risk of coming into contact with fluids containing these viruses by: Hepatitis B and C can carry through sexual intercourse and sexual contact. Using barrier methods, such as condoms and dental dams, during sexual activity can help decrease the risk of infection. Chronic hepatitis B or C can lead to more severe health problems. Because the virus affects the liver, people with chronic hepatitis B or C are at risk of: When your liver stops functioning normally, liver failure can occur. Complications of liver failure include: People with chronic hepatitis B and C should avoid alcohol as it can accelerate liver disease and failure. Certain supplements and medications can also affect liver function. If you have chronic hepatitis B or C, check with your doctor before taking any new medications. Read this article in Spanish.

"Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue.[3][5] Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.[1][2] Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months.[1][6] Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure.[7] Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer.[3][8]
 Hepatitis is most commonly caused by the virus hepatovirus A, B, C, D, and E.[2][3] Other viruses can also cause liver inflammation, including cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and yellow fever virus. Other common causes of hepatitis include heavy alcohol use, certain medications, toxins, other infections, autoimmune diseases,[2][3] and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).[9] Hepatitis A and E are mainly spread by contaminated food and water.[3] Hepatitis B is mainly sexually transmitted, but may also be passed from mother to baby during pregnancy or childbirth and spread through infected blood.[3] Hepatitis C is commonly spread through infected blood such as may occur during needle sharing by intravenous drug users.[3] Hepatitis D can only infect people already infected with hepatitis B.[3]
 Hepatitis A, B, and D are preventable with immunization.[2] Medications may be used to treat chronic viral hepatitis.[1] Antiviral medications are recommended in all with chronic hepatitis C, except those with conditions that limit their life expectancy.[10] There is no specific treatment for NASH; physical activity, a healthy diet, and weight loss are recommended.[9] Autoimmune hepatitis may be treated with medications to suppress the immune system.[11] A liver transplant may be an option in both acute and chronic liver failure.[4]
 Worldwide in 2015, hepatitis A occurred in about 114 million people, chronic hepatitis B affected about 343 million people and chronic hepatitis C about 142 million people.[12] In the United States, NASH affects about 11 million people and alcoholic hepatitis affects about 5 million people.[9][13] Hepatitis results in more than a million deaths a year, most of which occur indirectly from liver scarring or liver cancer.[3][14] In the United States, hepatitis A is estimated to occur in about 2,500 people a year and results in about 75 deaths.[15] The word is derived from the Greek hêpar (ἧπαρ), meaning ""liver"", and -itis (-ῖτις), meaning ""inflammation"".[16]
 Hepatitis has a broad spectrum of presentations that range from a complete lack of symptoms to severe liver failure.[17][18][19] The acute form of hepatitis, generally caused by viral infection, is characterized by constitutional symptoms that are typically self-limiting.[17][18] Chronic hepatitis presents similarly, but can manifest signs and symptoms specific to liver dysfunction with long-standing inflammation and damage to the organ.[19][20]
 Acute viral hepatitis follows three distinct phases:
 Both drug-induced hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis can present very similarly to acute viral hepatitis, with slight variations in symptoms depending on the cause.[21][22] Cases of drug-induced hepatitis can manifest with systemic signs of an allergic reaction including rash, fever, serositis (inflammation of membranes lining certain organs), elevated eosinophils (a type of white blood cell), and suppression of bone marrow activity.[21]
 Fulminant hepatitis, or massive hepatic cell death, is a rare and life-threatening complication of acute hepatitis that can occur in cases of hepatitis B, D, and E, in addition to drug-induced and autoimmune hepatitis.[17][21][22] The complication more frequently occurs in instances of hepatitis B and D co-infection at a rate of 2–20% and in pregnant women with hepatitis E at rate of 15–20% of cases.[17][18] In addition to the signs of acute hepatitis, people can also demonstrate signs of coagulopathy (abnormal coagulation studies with easy bruising and bleeding) and encephalopathy (confusion, disorientation, and sleepiness).[17][18] Mortality due to fulminant hepatitis is typically the result of various complications including cerebral edema, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, respiratory failure, or kidney failure.[17]
 Acute cases of hepatitis are seen to be resolved well within a six-month period. When hepatitis is continued for more than six months it is termed chronic hepatitis.[23] Chronic hepatitis is often asymptomatic early in its course and is detected only by liver laboratory studies for screening purposes or to evaluate non-specific symptoms.[19][20] As the inflammation progresses, patients can develop constitutional symptoms similar to acute hepatitis, including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, and joint pain.[20] Jaundice can occur as well, but much later in the disease process and is typically a sign of advanced disease.[20] Chronic hepatitis interferes with hormonal functions of the liver which can result in acne, hirsutism (abnormal hair growth), and amenorrhea (lack of menstrual period) in women.[20] Extensive damage and scarring of the liver over time defines cirrhosis, a condition in which the liver's ability to function is permanently impeded.[19] This results in jaundice, weight loss, coagulopathy, ascites (abdominal fluid collection), and peripheral edema (leg swelling).[20] Cirrhosis can lead to other life-threatening complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices,  hepatorenal syndrome, and liver cancer.[19]
 Causes of hepatitis can be divided into the following major categories: infectious, metabolic, ischemic, autoimmune, genetic, and other. Infectious agents include viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Metabolic causes include prescription medications, toxins (most notably alcohol), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Autoimmune and genetic causes of hepatitis involve genetic predispositions and tend to affect characteristic populations.[24]
 Viral hepatitis is the most common type of hepatitis worldwide, especially in Asia and Africa.[25] Viral hepatitis is caused by five different viruses (hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E).[17] Hepatitis A and hepatitis E behave similarly: they are both transmitted by the fecal–oral route, are more common in developing countries, and are self-limiting illnesses that do not lead to chronic hepatitis.[17][26][27]
 Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis D are transmitted when blood or mucous membranes are exposed to infected blood and body fluids, such as semen and vaginal secretions.[17] Viral particles have also been found in saliva and breastmilk. Kissing, sharing utensils, and breastfeeding do not lead to transmission unless these fluids are introduced into open sores or cuts.[28] Many families who do not have safe drinking water or live in unhygienic homes have contracted hepatitis because saliva and blood droplets are often carried through the water and blood-borne illnesses spread quickly in unsanitary settings.[29]
 Hepatitis B and C can present either acutely or chronically.[17] Hepatitis D is a defective virus that requires hepatitis B to replicate and is only found with hepatitis B co-infection.[17] In adults, hepatitis B infection is most commonly self-limiting, with less than 5% progressing to chronic state, and 20 to 30% of those chronically infected developing cirrhosis or liver cancer.[30] Infection in infants and children frequently leads to chronic infection.[30]
 Unlike hepatitis B, most cases of hepatitis C lead to chronic infection.[31] Hepatitis C is the second most common cause of cirrhosis in the US (second to alcoholic hepatitis).[32] In the 1970s and 1980s, blood transfusions were a major factor in spreading hepatitis C virus.[31] Since widespread screening of blood products for hepatitis C began in 1992, the risk of acquiring hepatitis C from a blood transfusion has decreased from approximately 10% in the 1970s to 1 in 2 million currently.[17]
 Parasites can also infect the liver and activate the immune response, resulting in symptoms of acute hepatitis with increased serum IgE (though chronic hepatitis is possible with chronic infections).[33] Of the protozoans, Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania species, and the malaria-causing Plasmodium species all can cause liver inflammation.[33] Another protozoan, Entamoeba histolytica, causes hepatitis with distinct liver abscesses.[33]
 Of the worms, the cestode Echinococcus granulosus, also known as the dog tapeworm, infects the liver and forms characteristic hepatic hydatid cysts.[33] The liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and Clonorchis sinensis live in the bile ducts and cause progressive hepatitis and liver fibrosis.[33]
 Bacterial infection of the liver commonly results in pyogenic liver abscesses, acute hepatitis, or granulomatous (or chronic) liver disease.[34] Pyogenic abscesses commonly involve enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and are composed of multiple bacteria up to 50% of the time.[34] Acute hepatitis is caused by Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bartonella henselae, Borrelia burgdorferi, salmonella species, brucella species and campylobacter species.[34] Chronic or granulomatous hepatitis is seen with infection from mycobacteria species, Tropheryma whipplei, Treponema pallidum, Coxiella burnetii, and rickettsia species.[34]
 Excessive alcohol consumption is a significant cause of hepatitis and is the most common cause of cirrhosis in the U.S.[32] Alcoholic hepatitis is within the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease. This ranges in order of severity and reversibility from alcoholic steatosis (least severe, most reversible), alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer (most severe, least reversible).[32] Hepatitis usually develops over years-long exposure to alcohol, occurring in 10 to 20% of alcoholics.[35] The most important risk factors for the development of alcoholic hepatitis are quantity and duration of alcohol intake.[35] Long-term alcohol intake in excess of 80 grams of alcohol a day in men and 40 grams a day in women is associated with development of alcoholic hepatitis (1 beer or 4 ounces of wine is equivalent to 12g of alcohol).[32] Alcoholic hepatitis can vary from asymptomatic hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) to symptoms of acute or chronic hepatitis to liver failure.[32]
 Many chemical agents, including medications, industrial toxins, and herbal and dietary supplements, can cause hepatitis.[36][37] The spectrum of drug-induced liver injury varies from acute hepatitis to chronic hepatitis to acute liver failure.[36] Toxins and medications can cause liver injury through a variety of mechanisms, including direct cell damage, disruption of cell metabolism, and causing structural changes.[38] Some drugs such as paracetamol exhibit predictable dose-dependent liver damage while others such as isoniazid cause idiosyncratic and unpredictable reactions that vary by person.[36] There are wide variations in the mechanisms of liver injury and latency period from exposure to development of clinical illness.[32]
 Many types of drugs can cause liver injury, including the analgesic paracetamol; antibiotics such as isoniazid, nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, erythromycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; anticonvulsants such as valproate and phenytoin; cholesterol-lowering statins; steroids such as oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids; and highly active anti-retroviral therapy used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS.[32] Of these, amoxicillin-clavulanate is the most common cause of drug-induced liver injury, and paracetamol toxicity  the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States and Europe.[36]
 Herbal remedies and dietary supplements are another important cause of hepatitis; these are the most common causes of drug-induced hepatitis in Korea.[39] The United-States-based Drug Induced Liver Injury Network linked more than 16% of cases of hepatotoxicity to herbal and dietary supplements.[40] In the United States, herbal and dietary supplements – unlike pharmaceutical drugs – are unregulated by the Food and Drug Administration.[40] The National Institutes of Health maintains the LiverTox Archived 2019-07-24 at the Wayback Machine database for consumers to track all known prescription and non-prescription compounds associated with liver injury.[41]
 Exposure to other hepatotoxins can occur accidentally or intentionally through ingestion, inhalation, and skin absorption. The industrial toxin carbon tetrachloride and the wild mushroom Amanita phalloides are other known hepatotoxins.[36][37][42]
 Non-alcoholic hepatitis is within the spectrum of non-alcoholic liver disease (NALD), which ranges in severity and reversibility from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to cirrhosis to liver cancer, similar to the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease.[43]
 Non-alcoholic liver disease occurs in people with little or no history of alcohol use, and is instead strongly associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia.[32] Over time, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which additionally involves liver cell death, liver inflammation and possible fibrosis.[32] Factors accelerating progression from NAFLD to NASH are obesity, older age, non-African American ethnicity, female gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, higher ALT or AST level, higher AST/ALT ratio, low platelet count, and an ultrasound steatosis score.[32]
 In the early stages (as with NAFLD and early NASH), most patients are asymptomatic or have mild right upper quadrant pain, and diagnosis is suspected on the basis of abnormal liver function tests.[32] As the disease progresses, symptoms typical of chronic hepatitis may develop.[44] While imaging can show fatty liver, only liver biopsy can demonstrate inflammation and fibrosis characteristic of NASH.[45] 9 to 25% of patients with NASH develop cirrhosis.[32] NASH is recognized as the third most common cause of liver disease in the United States.[44]
 Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic disease caused by an abnormal immune response against liver cells.[46] The disease is thought to have a genetic predisposition as it is associated with certain human leukocyte antigens involved in the immune response.[47] As in other autoimmune diseases, circulating auto-antibodies may be present and are helpful in diagnosis.[48] Auto-antibodies found in patients with autoimmune hepatitis include the sensitive but less specific anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA), and atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA).[48] Other autoantibodies that are less common but more specific to autoimmune hepatitis are the antibodies against liver kidney microsome 1 (LKM1) and soluble liver antigen (SLA).[48] Autoimmune hepatitis can also be triggered by drugs (such as nitrofurantoin, hydralazine, and methyldopa), after liver transplant, or by viruses (such as hepatitis A, Epstein-Barr virus, or measles).[32]
 Autoimmune hepatitis can present anywhere within the spectrum from asymptomatic to acute or chronic hepatitis to fulminant liver failure.[32] Patients are asymptomatic 25–34% of the time, and the diagnosis is suspected on the basis of abnormal liver function tests.[48] Some studies show between 25% and 75% of cases present with signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis.[32][49] As with other autoimmune diseases, autoimmune hepatitis usually affects young females (though it can affect patients of either sex of any age), and patients can exhibit classic signs and symptoms of autoimmunity such as fatigue, anemia, anorexia, amenorrhea, acne, arthritis, pleurisy, thyroiditis, ulcerative colitis, nephritis, and maculopapular rash.[32] Autoimmune hepatitis increases the risk for cirrhosis, and the risk for liver cancer is increased by about 1% for each year of the disease.[32]
 Many people with autoimmune hepatitis have other autoimmune diseases.[50] Autoimmune hepatitis is distinct from the other autoimmune diseases of the liver, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, both of which can also lead to scarring, fibrosis, and cirrhosis of the liver.[32][48]
 Genetic causes of hepatitis include alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, and Wilson's disease.[32] In alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, a co-dominant mutation in the gene for alpha-1-antitrypsin results in the abnormal accumulation of the mutant AAT protein within liver cells, leading to liver disease.[51] Hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease are both autosomal recessive diseases involving abnormal storage of minerals.[32] In hemochromatosis, excess amounts of iron accumulate in multiple body sites, including the liver, which can lead to cirrhosis.[32] In Wilson's disease, excess amounts of copper accumulate in the liver and brain, causing cirrhosis and dementia.[32]
 When the liver is involved, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and Wilson's disease tend to present as hepatitis in the neonatal period or in childhood.[32] Hemochromatosis typically presents in adulthood, with the onset of clinical disease usually after age 50.[32]
 Ischemic hepatitis (also known as shock liver) results from reduced blood flow to the liver as in shock, heart failure, or vascular insufficiency.[52] The condition is most often associated with heart failure but can also be caused by shock or sepsis. Blood testing of a person with ischemic hepatitis will show very high levels of transaminase enzymes (AST and ALT). The condition usually resolves if the underlying cause is treated successfully. Ischemic hepatitis rarely causes permanent liver damage.[53]
 Hepatitis can also occur in neonates and is attributable to a variety of causes, some of which are not typically seen in adults.[54] Congenital or perinatal infection with the hepatitis viruses, toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and syphilis can cause neonatal hepatitis.[54] Structural abnormalities such as biliary atresia and choledochal cysts can lead to cholestatic liver injury leading to neonatal hepatitis.[54] Metabolic diseases such as glycogen storage disorders and lysosomal storage disorders are also implicated.[54] Neonatal hepatitis can be idiopathic, and in such cases, biopsy often shows large multinucleated cells in the liver tissue.[55] This disease is termed giant cell hepatitis and may be associated with viral infection, autoimmune disorders, and drug toxicity.[56][57]
 The specific mechanism varies and depends on the underlying cause of the hepatitis. Generally, there is an initial insult that causes liver injury and activation of an inflammatory response, which can become chronic, leading to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis.[17]
 The pathway by which hepatic viruses cause viral hepatitis is best understood in the case of hepatitis B and C.[17] The viruses do not directly activate apoptosis (cell death).[17][58] Rather, infection of liver cells activates the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system leading to an inflammatory response which causes cellular damage and death, including viral-induced apoptosis via the induction of the death receptor-mediated signaling pathway.[17][58][59][60]  Depending on the strength of the immune response, the types of immune cells involved and the ability of the virus to evade the body's defense, infection can either lead to clearance (acute disease) or persistence (chronic disease) of the virus.[17]  The chronic presence of the virus within liver cells results in multiple waves of inflammation, injury and wound healing that over time lead to scarring or fibrosis and culminate in hepatocellular carcinoma.[58][61] People with impaired immune response are at greater risk of developing chronic infection.[17] Natural killer cells are the primary drivers of the initial innate response and create a cytokine environment that results in the recruitment of CD4 T-helper and CD8 cytotoxic T-cells.[62][63] Type I interferons are the cytokines that drive the antiviral response.[63] In chronic Hepatitis B and C, natural killer cell function is impaired.[62]
 Steatohepatitis is seen in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease and is the culmination of a cascade of events that began with injury.  In the case of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, this cascade is initiated by changes in metabolism associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and lipid dysregulation.[64][65] In alcoholic hepatitis, chronic excess alcohol use is the culprit.[66]  Though the inciting event may differ, the progression of events is similar and begins with accumulation of free fatty acids (FFA) and their breakdown products  in the liver cells in a process called steatosis.[64][65][66] This initially reversible process overwhelms the hepatocyte's ability to maintain lipid homeostasis leading to a toxic effect  as fat molecules accumulate and are broken down in the setting of an oxidative stress response.[64][65][66]  Over time, this abnormal lipid deposition triggers the immune system via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF that cause liver cell injury and death.[64][65][66]  These events mark the transition to steatohepatitis and in the setting of chronic injury, fibrosis eventually develops setting up events that lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.[64] Microscopically, changes that can be seen include steatosis with large and swollen hepatocytes (ballooning), evidence of cellular injury and cell death (apoptosis, necrosis), evidence of inflammation in particular in zone 3 of the liver, variable degrees of fibrosis and Mallory bodies.[64][67][68]
 Diagnosis of hepatitis is made on the basis of some or all of the following: a person's signs and symptoms, medical history including sexual and substance use history, blood tests, imaging, and liver biopsy.[32] In general, for viral hepatitis and other acute causes of hepatitis, the person's blood tests and clinical picture are sufficient for diagnosis.[17][32] For other causes of hepatitis, especially chronic causes, blood tests may not be useful.[32] In this case, liver biopsy is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis: histopathologic analysis is able to reveal the precise extent and pattern of inflammation and fibrosis.[32] Biopsy is typically not the initial diagnostic test because it is invasive and is associated with a small but significant risk of bleeding that is increased in people with liver injury and cirrhosis.[69]
 Blood testing includes liver enzymes, serology (i.e. for autoantibodies), nucleic acid testing (i.e. for hepatitis virus DNA/RNA), blood chemistry, and complete blood count.[32] Characteristic patterns of liver enzyme abnormalities can point to certain causes or stages of hepatitis.[70][71] Generally, AST and ALT are elevated in most cases of hepatitis regardless of whether the person shows any symptoms.[32] The degree of elevation (i.e. levels in the hundreds vs. in the thousands), the predominance for AST vs. ALT elevation, and the ratio between AST and ALT are informative of the diagnosis.[32]
 Ultrasound, CT, and MRI can all identify steatosis (fatty changes) of the liver tissue and nodularity of the liver surface suggestive of cirrhosis.[72][73] CT and especially MRI are able to provide a higher level of detail, allowing visualization and characterize such structures as vessels and tumors within the liver.[74] Unlike steatosis and cirrhosis, no imaging test is able to detect liver inflammation (i.e. hepatitis) or fibrosis.[32] Liver biopsy is the only definitive diagnostic test that is able to assess inflammation and fibrosis of the liver.[32]
 Viral hepatitis is primarily diagnosed through blood tests for levels of viral antigens (such as the hepatitis B surface or core antigen), anti-viral antibodies (such as the anti-hepatitis B surface antibody or anti-hepatitis A antibody), or viral DNA/RNA.[17][32] In early infection (i.e. within 1 week), IgM antibodies are found in the blood.[32] In late infection and after recovery, IgG antibodies are present and remain in the body for up to years.[32] Therefore, when a patient is positive for IgG antibody but negative for IgM antibody, he is considered immune from the virus via either prior infection and recovery or prior vaccination.[32]
 In the case of hepatitis B, blood tests exist for multiple virus antigens (which are different components of the virion particle) and antibodies.[75] The combination of antigen and antibody positivity can provide information about the stage of infection (acute or chronic), the degree of viral replication, and the infectivity of the virus.[75]
 The most apparent distinguishing factor between alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a history of excessive alcohol use.[76] Thus, in patients who have no or negligible alcohol use, the diagnosis is unlikely to be alcoholic hepatitis. In those who drink alcohol, the diagnosis may just as likely be alcoholic or nonalcoholic hepatitis especially if there is concurrent obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. In this case, alcoholic and nonalcoholic hepatitis can be distinguished by the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities; specifically, in alcoholic steatohepatitis AST>ALT with ratio of AST:ALT>2:1 while in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ALT>AST with ratio of ALT:AST>1.5:1.[76]
 Liver biopsies show identical findings in patients with ASH and NASH, specifically, the presence of polymorphonuclear infiltration, hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis in the form of ballooning degeneration, Mallory bodies, and fibrosis around veins and sinuses.[32]
 The purpose of screening for viral hepatitis is to identify people infected with the disease as early as possible, even before symptoms and transaminase elevations may be present. This allows for early treatment, which can both prevent disease progression and  decrease the likelihood of transmission to others.[77]
 Hepatitis A causes an acute illness that does not progress to chronic liver disease. Therefore, the role of screening is to assess immune status in people who are at high risk of contracting the virus, as well as in people with known liver disease for whom hepatitis A infection could lead to liver failure.[78][79] People in these groups who are not already immune can receive the hepatitis A vaccine.[citation needed]
 Those at high risk and in need of screening include:[80][81][82]
 The presence of anti-hepatitis A IgG in the blood indicates past infection with the virus or prior vaccination.[83]
 The CDC, WHO, USPSTF, and ACOG recommend routine hepatitis B screening for certain high-risk populations.[84][85][86][87] Specifically, these populations include people who are:
 Screening consists of a blood test that detects hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). If HBsAg is present, a second test – usually done on the same blood sample – that detects the antibody for the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBcAg) can differentiate between acute and chronic infection.[84][88] People who are high-risk whose blood tests negative for HBsAg can receive the hepatitis B vaccine to prevent future infection.[84][85][86][87]
 The CDC, WHO, USPSTF, AASLD, and ACOG recommend screening people at high risk for hepatitis C infection.[87][89][90][91][10] These populations include people who are:
 For people in the groups above whose exposure is ongoing, screening should be periodic, though there is no set optimal screening interval.[91] The AASLD recommends screening men who have sex with men who are HIV-positive annually.[10] People born in the US between 1945 and 1965 should be screened once (unless they have other exposure risks).[89][91][10]
 Screening consists of a blood test that detects anti-hepatitis C virus antibody. If anti-hepatitis C virus antibody is present, a confirmatory test to detect HCV RNA indicates chronic disease.[90][10]
 The CDC, WHO, USPSTF, AASLD, and ACOG recommend screening people at high risk for hepatitis D infection.[87][89][90][91][10] These populations include people who are:
 Hepatitis D is extremely rare. Symptoms include chronic diarrhea, anal and intestinal blisters, purple urine, and burnt popcorn scented breath.[84][85][86]
Screening consists of a blood test that detects the anti-hepitits D virus antibbody. If anti-hepitits D virus antibody is present, a confirmatory test to detect HDV RNA DNA indicates chronic disease.[90][10] The CDC recommends the hepatitis A vaccine for all children beginning at age one, as well as for those who have not been previously immunized and are at high risk for contracting the disease.[80][81]
 For children 12 months of age or older, the vaccination is given as a shot into the muscle in two doses 6–18 months apart and should be started before the age 24 months.[92]  The dosing is slightly different for adults depending on the type of the vaccine.  If the vaccine is for hepatitis A only, two doses are given 6–18 months apart depending on the manufacturer.[82]  If the vaccine is combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B, up to 4 doses may be required.[82]
 The CDC recommends the routine vaccination of all children under the age of 19 with the hepatitis B vaccine.[93] They also recommend it for those who desire it or are at high risk.[81]
 Routine vaccination for hepatitis B starts with the first dose administered as  a shot into the muscle before the newborn is discharged from the hospital.  An additional two doses should be administered before the child is 18 months.[92]
 For babies born to a mother with hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, the first dose is unique – in addition to the vaccine, the hepatitis immune globulin should also be administered, both within 12 hours of birth.  These newborns should also be regularly tested for infection for at least the first year of life.[92]
 There is also a combination formulation that includes both hepatitis A and B vaccines.[94]
 There are currently no vaccines available in the United States for hepatitis C or E.[90][95][96] In 2015, a group in China published an article regarding the development of a vaccine for hepatitis E.[97] As of March 2016, the United States government was in the process of recruiting participants for the phase IV trial of the hepatitis E vaccine.[98]
 Because hepatitis A is transmitted primarily through the oral-fecal route, the mainstay of prevention aside from vaccination is good hygiene, access to clean water and proper handling of sewage.[81]
 As hepatitis B and C are transmitted through blood and multiple bodily fluids, prevention is aimed at screening blood prior to transfusion, abstaining from the use of injection drugs, safe needle and sharps practices in healthcare settings, and safe sex practices.[30][90]
 The hepatitis D virus requires that a person first be infected with hepatitis B virus, so prevention efforts should focus on limiting the spread of hepatitis B. In people who have chronic hepatitis B infection and are at risk for superinfection with the hepatitis D virus, the preventive strategies are the same as for hepatitis B.[96]
 Hepatitis E is spread primarily through the oral-fecal route but may also be spread by blood and from mother to fetus.  The mainstay of hepatitis E prevention is similar to that for hepatitis A (namely, good hygiene and clean water practices).[95]
 As excessive alcohol consumption can lead to hepatitis and cirrhosis, the following are maximal recommendations for alcohol consumption:[100]
 To prevent MAFLD it is recommended to maintain a normal weight, eat a healthy diet, avoid added sugar, and exercise regularly.[101][102]
 In the United States, universal immunization has led to a two-thirds decrease in hospital admissions and medical expenses due to hepatitis A.[103]
 In the United States new cases of hepatitis B decreased 75% from 1990 to 2004.[104]  The group that saw the greatest decrease was children and adolescents, likely reflecting the implementation of the 1999 guidelines.[105]
 Hepatitis C infections each year had been declining since the 1980s, but began to increase again in 2006.[106]  The data are unclear as to whether the decline can be attributed to needle exchange programmes.[107]
 Because people with alcoholic hepatitis may have no symptoms, it can be difficult to diagnose and the number of people with the disease is probably higher than many estimates.[108] Programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous have been successful in decreasing death due to cirrhosis, but it is difficult to evaluate their success in decreasing the incidence of alcoholic hepatitis.[109]
 The treatment of hepatitis varies according to the type, whether it is acute or chronic, and the severity of the disease.
 Hepatitis A usually does not progress to a chronic state, and rarely requires hospitalization.[17][80] Treatment is supportive and includes such measures as providing intravenous (IV) hydration and maintaining adequate nutrition.[17][80]
 Rarely, people with the hepatitis A virus can rapidly develop liver failure, termed fulminant hepatic failure, especially the elderly and those who had a pre-existing liver disease, especially hepatitis C.[17][80] Mortality risk factors include greater age and chronic hepatitis C.[17] In these cases, more aggressive supportive therapy and liver transplant may be necessary.[17]
 In healthy patients, 95–99% recover with no long-lasting effects, and antiviral treatment is not warranted.[17] Age and comorbid conditions can result in a more prolonged and severe illness. Certain patients warrant hospitalization, especially those who present with clinical signs of ascites, peripheral edema, and hepatic encephalopathy, and laboratory signs of hypoglycemia, prolonged prothrombin time, low serum albumin, and very high serum bilirubin.[17]
 In these rare, more severe acute cases, patients have been successfully treated with antiviral therapy similar to that used in cases of chronic hepatitis B, with nucleoside analogues such as entecavir or tenofovir. As there is a dearth of clinical trial data and the drugs used to treat are prone to developing resistance, experts recommend reserving treatment for severe acute cases, not mild to moderate.[17]
 Chronic hepatitis B management aims to control viral replication, which is correlated with progression of disease.[20] Seven drugs are approved in the United States:[20]
 First-line treatments currently used include PEG IFN, entecavir, and tenofovir, subject to patient and physician preference.[20] Treatment initiation is guided by recommendations issued by The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and is based on detectable viral levels, HBeAg positive or negative status, ALT levels, and in certain cases, family history of HCC and liver biopsy.[20] In patients with compensated cirrhosis, treatment is recommended regardless of HBeAg status or ALT level, but recommendations differ regarding HBV DNA levels; AASLD recommends treating at DNA levels detectable above 2x103 IU/mL; EASL and WHO recommend treating when HBV DNA levels are detectable at any level.[20][86] In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, treatment and evaluation for liver transplantation are recommended in all cases if HBV DNA is detectable.[20][86] Currently, multidrug treatment is not recommended in treatment of chronic HBV as it is no more effective in the long term than individual treatment with entecavir or tenofovir.[20]
 The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (AASLD-IDSA) recommend antiviral treatment for all patients with chronic hepatitis C infection except for those with additional chronic medical conditions that limit their life expectancy.[10]
 Once it is acquired, persistence of the hepatitis C virus is the rule, resulting in chronic hepatitis C. The goal of treatment is prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).[110] The best way to reduce the long-term risk of HCC is to achieve sustained virological response (SVR).[110] SVR is defined as an undetectable viral load at 12 weeks after treatment completion and indicates a cure.[111][112] Currently available treatments include indirect and direct acting antiviral drugs.[111][112] The indirect acting antivirals include pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), which in combination have historically been the basis of therapy for HCV.[111][112] Duration of and response to these treatments varies based on genotype.[111][112] These agents are poorly tolerated but are still used in some resource-poor areas.[111][112] In high-resource countries, they have been supplanted by direct acting antiviral agents, which first appeared in 2011; these agents target proteins responsible for viral replication and include the following three classes:[111][112]
 These drugs are used in various combinations, sometimes combined with ribavirin, based on the patient's genotype, delineated as genotypes 1–6.[112] Genotype 1 (GT1), which is the most prevalent genotype in the United States and around the world, can now be cured with a direct acting antiviral regimen.[112] First-line therapy for GT1 is a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) for 12 weeks for most patients, including those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.[112] Certain patients with early disease need only 8 weeks of treatment while those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who have not responded to prior treatment require 24 weeks.[112] Cost remains a major factor limiting access to these drugs, particularly in low-resource nations; the cost of the 12-week GT1 regimen (SOF/LDV)  has been estimated at US$94,500.[111]
 Hepatitis D is difficult to treat, and effective treatments are lacking. Interferon alpha has proven effective at inhibiting viral activity but only on a temporary basis.[113]
 Similar to hepatitis A, treatment of hepatitis E is supportive and includes rest and ensuring adequate nutrition and hydration.[114] Hospitalization may be required for particularly severe cases or for pregnant women.[114]
 First-line treatment of alcoholic hepatitis is treatment of alcoholism.[35] For those who abstain completely from alcohol, reversal of liver disease and a longer life are possible; patients at every disease stage have been shown to benefit by prevention of additional liver injury.[35][66] In addition to referral to psychotherapy and other treatment programs, treatment should include nutritional and psychosocial evaluation and treatment.[35][66][115] Patients should also be treated appropriately for related signs and symptoms, such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and infection.[66]
 Severe alcoholic hepatitis has a poor prognosis and is notoriously difficult to treat.[35][66][115] Without any treatment, 20–50% of patients may die within a month, but evidence shows treatment may extend life beyond one month (i.e., reduce short-term mortality).[35][115][116] Available treatment options include pentoxifylline (PTX), which is a nonspecific TNF inhibitor, corticosteroids, such as prednisone or prednisolone (CS), corticosteroids with N-acetylcysteine (CS with NAC), and corticosteroids with pentoxifylline (CS with PTX).[115] Data suggest that CS alone or CS with NAC are most effective at reducing short-term mortality.[115] Unfortunately, corticosteroids are contraindicated in some patients, such as those who have active gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, kidney failure, or pancreatitis.[35][66] In these cases PTX may be considered on a case-by-case basis in lieu of CS; some evidence shows PTX is better than no treatment at all and may be comparable to CS while other data show no evidence of benefit over placebo.[115][116] Unfortunately, there are currently no drug treatments that decrease these patients' risk of dying in the longer term, at 3–12 months and beyond.[115]
 Weak evidence suggests milk thistle extracts may improve survival in alcoholic liver disease and improve certain liver tests (serum bilirubin and GGT) without causing side effects, but a firm recommendation cannot be made for or against milk thistle without further study.[117] 
 The modified Maddrey's discriminant function may be used to evaluate the severity and prognosis in alcoholic hepatitis and evaluates the efficacy of using alcoholic hepatitis corticosteroid treatment.
 The main treatment of NASH  is gradual weight loss and increased physical activity. In the United States, no medications have been approved to treat this disease.[118]
 Autoimmune hepatitis is commonly treated by immunosuppressants such as the corticosteroids prednisone or prednisolone, the active version of prednisolone that does not require liver synthesis, either alone or in combination with azathioprine, and some have suggested the combination therapy is preferred to allow for lower doses of corticosteroids to reduce associated side effects,[49] although the result of treatment efficacy is comparative.[119]
 Treatment of autoimmune hepatitis consists of two phases; an initial and maintenance phase. The initial phase consists of higher doses of corticosteroids which are tapered down over a number of weeks to a lower dose. If used in combination, azathioprine is given during the initial phase as well. Once the initial phase has been completed, a maintenance phase that consists of lower dose corticosteroids, and in combination therapy, azathioprine until liver blood markers are normalized. Treatment results in 66–91% of patients achieving normal liver test values in two years, with the average being 22 months.[49]
 Nearly all patients with hepatitis A infections recover completely without complications if they were healthy prior to the infection. Similarly, acute hepatitis B infections have a favorable course towards complete recovery in 95–99% of patients.[17] Certain factors may portend a poorer outcome, such as co-morbid medical conditions or initial presenting symptoms of ascites, edema, or encephalopathy.[17] Overall, the mortality rate for acute hepatitis is low: ~0.1% in total for cases of hepatitis A and B, but rates can be higher in certain populations (super infection with both hepatitis B and D, pregnant women, etc.).[17]
 In contrast to hepatitis A & B, hepatitis C carries a much higher risk of progressing to chronic hepatitis, approaching 85–90%.[120]  Cirrhosis has been reported to develop in 20–50% of patients with chronic hepatitis C.[citation needed]
 Other rare complications of acute hepatitis include pancreatitis, aplastic anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and myocarditis.[17]
 Despite the relatively benign course of most viral cases of hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis represents a rare but feared complication. Fulminant hepatitis most commonly occurs in hepatitis B, D, and E. About 1–2% of cases of hepatitis E can lead to fulminant hepatitis, but pregnant women are particularly susceptible, occurring in up to 20% of cases.[121] Mortality rates in cases of fulminant hepatitis rise over 80%, but those patients that do survive often make a complete recovery. Liver transplantation can be life-saving in patients with fulminant liver failure.[122]
 Hepatitis D infections can transform benign cases of hepatitis B into severe, progressive hepatitis, a phenomenon known as superinfection.[123]
 Acute hepatitis B infections become less likely to progress to chronic forms as the age of the patient increases, with rates of progression approaching 90% in vertically transmitted cases of infants compared to 1% risk in young adults.[20] Overall, the five-year survival rate for chronic hepatitis B ranges from 97% in mild cases to 55% in severe cases with cirrhosis.[20]
 Most patients who acquire hepatitis D at the same time as hepatitis B (co-infection) recover without developing a chronic infection. In people with hepatitis B who later acquire hepatitis D (superinfection), chronic infection is much more common at 80–90%, and liver disease progression is accelerated.[113][124]
 Chronic hepatitis C progresses towards cirrhosis, with estimates of cirrhosis prevalence of 16% at 20 years after infection.[125] While the major causes of mortality in hepatitis C is end stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma is an important additional long term complication and cause of death in chronic hepatitis.
 Rates of mortality increase with progression of the underlying liver disease. Series of patients with compensated cirrhosis due to HCV have shown 3,5, and 10-year survival rates of 96, 91, and 79% respectively.[126]  The 5-year survival rate drops to 50% upon if the cirrhosis becomes decompensated.
 Hepatitis A is found throughout the world and manifests as large outbreaks and epidemics associated with fecal contamination of water and food sources.[105] Hepatitis A viral infection is predominant in children ages 5–14 with rare infection of infants.[105] Infected children have little to no apparent clinical illness, in contrast to adults in whom greater than 80% are symptomatic if infected.[127] Infection rates are highest in low resource countries with inadequate public sanitation and large concentrated populations.[17][128]  In such regions, as much as 90% of children younger than 10 years old have been infected and are immune, corresponding both to lower rates of clinically symptomatic disease and outbreaks.[105][128][129] The availability of a childhood vaccine has significantly reduced infections in the United States, with incidence declining by more than 95% as of 2013.[130] Paradoxically, the highest rates of new infection now occur in young adults and adults who present with worse clinical illness.[17] Specific populations at greatest risk include: travelers to endemic regions, men who have sex with men, those with occupational exposure to non-human primates, people with clotting disorders who have received clotting factors, people with history of chronic liver disease in whom co-infection with hepatitis A can lead to fulminant hepatitis, and intravenous drug users (rare).[105]
 Hepatitis B is the most common cause of viral hepatitis in the world with more than 240 million chronic carriers of the virus, 1 million of whom are in the United States.[30][105] In approximately two-thirds of patients who develop acute hepatitis B infection, no identifiable exposure is evident.[17]  Of those acutely infected, 25% become lifetime carriers of the virus.[105] Risk of infection is highest among intravenous drug users, people with high-risk sexual behaviors, healthcare workers, people who had multiple transfusions, organ transplant patients, dialysis patients and newborns infected during the birthing process.[105] Close to 780,000 deaths in the world are attributed to hepatitis B.[30] The most endemic regions are in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, where as many as 10% of adults are chronic carriers.[30] Carrier rates in developed nations are significantly lower, encompassing less than 1% of the population.[30] In endemic regions, transmission is thought to be associated with exposure during birth and close contact between young infants.[17][30]
 Chronic hepatitis C is a major cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.[131] It is a common medical reason for liver transplantation due to its severe complications.[131] It is estimated that 130–180 million people in the world are affected by this disease representing a little more than 3% of the world population.[90][105][131] In the developing regions of Africa, Asia and South America, prevalence can be as high as 10% of the population.[105] In Egypt, rates of hepatitis C infection as high as 20%  have been documented and are associated with iatrogenic contamination related to schistosomiasis treatment in the 1950s–1980s.[17][105] Currently in the United States, approximately 3.5 million adults are estimated to be infected.[132] Hepatitis C is particularly prevalent among people born between 1945 and 1965, a group of about 800,000 people, with prevalence as high as 3.2% versus 1.6% in the general U.S. population.[17] Most chronic carriers of hepatitis C are unaware of their infection status.[17] The most common mode of transmission of hepatitis C virus is exposure to blood products via blood transfusions (prior to 1992) and intravenous drug injection.[17][105] A history of intravenous drug injection is the most important risk factor for chronic hepatitis C.[131] Other susceptible populations include those engaged in high-risk sexual behavior, infants of infected mothers, and healthcare workers.[105]
 The hepatitis D virus causes chronic and fulminant hepatitis in the context of co-infection with the hepatitis B virus.[105] It is primarily transmitted via non-sexual contact and via needles.[17][105] Susceptibility to hepatitis D differs by geographic region.[17][105] In the United States and Northern Europe, populations at risk are intravenous drug users and people who receive multiple transfusions.[17][105] In the Mediterranean, hepatitis D is predominant among hepatitis B virus co-infected people.[17][105]
 Similar to Hepatitis A, hepatitis E manifests as large outbreaks and epidemics associated with fecal contamination of water sources.[17] It accounts for more than 55,000 deaths annually with approximately 20 million people worldwide thought to be infected with the virus.[95] It affects predominantly young adults, causing acute hepatitis.[17][133] In infected pregnant women, Hepatitis E infection can lead to fulminant hepatitis with third trimester mortality rates as high as 30%.[105][133] Those with weakened immune systems, such as organ transplant recipients, are also susceptible.[133] Infection is rare in the United States but rates are high in the developing world (Africa, Asia, Central America, Middle East).[17][133] Many genotypes exist and are differentially distributed around the world.[95] There is some evidence of hepatitis E infection of animals, serving as a reservoir for human infection.[105]
 Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) in its severe form has a one-month mortality as high as 50%.[66][67][134] Most people who develop AH are men but women are at higher risk of developing AH and its complications likely secondary to high body fat and differences in alcohol metabolism.[67] Other contributing factors include younger age <60, binge pattern drinking, poor nutritional status, obesity and hepatitis C co-infection.[67] It is estimated that as much as 20% of people with AH are also infected with hepatitis C.[135]  In this population, the presence of hepatitis C virus leads to more severe disease with faster progression to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and increased mortality.[67][135][136] Obesity increases the likelihood of progression to cirrhosis in cases of alcoholic hepatitis.[67]  It is estimated that 70% of people who have AH will progress to cirrhosis.[67]
 Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is projected to become the top reason for liver transplantation in the United States by 2020, supplanting chronic liver disease due to hepatitis C.[137]  About 20–45% of the U.S. population have NAFLD and 6% have NASH.[32][43] The estimated prevalence of NASH in the world is 3–5%.[138]  Of NASH patients who develop cirrhosis, about 2% per year will likely progress to hepatocellular carcinoma.[138]   Worldwide, the estimated prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma related to NAFLD is 15–30%.[139] NASH is thought to be the primary cause of cirrhosis in approximately 25% of patients in the United States, representing 1–2% of the general population.[139]
 Initial accounts of a syndrome that we now think is likely to be hepatitis begin to occur around 3000 B.C.  Clay tablets that served as medical handbooks for the ancient Sumerians described the first observations of jaundice.  The Sumerians believed that the liver was the home of the soul, and attributed the findings of jaundice to the attack of the liver by a devil named Ahhazu.[140]
 Around 400 B.C., Hippocrates recorded the first documentation of an epidemic jaundice, in particular noting the uniquely fulminant course of a cohort of patients who all died within two weeks.  He wrote, ""The bile contained in the liver is full of phlegm and blood, and erupts...After such an eruption, the patient soon raves, becomes angry, talks nonsense and barks like a dog.""[141]
 Given the poor sanitary conditions of war, infectious jaundice played a large role as a major cause of mortality among troops in the Napoleonic Wars, the American Revolutionary War, and both World Wars.[142] During World War II, estimates of soldiers affected by hepatitis were upwards of 10 million.
 During World War II, soldiers received vaccines against diseases such as yellow fever, but these vaccines were stabilized with human serum, presumably contaminated with hepatitis viruses, which often created epidemics of hepatitis.[143] It was suspected these epidemics were due to a separate infectious agent, and not due to the yellow fever virus itself, after noting 89 cases of jaundice in the months after vaccination out of a total 3,100 patients that were vaccinated.  After changing the seed virus strain, no cases of jaundice were observed in the subsequent 8,000 vaccinations.[144]
 A New York University researcher named Saul Krugman continued this research into the 1950s and 1960s, most infamously with his experiments on mentally disabled children at the Willowbrook State School in New York, a crowded urban facility where hepatitis infections were highly endemic to the student body.  Krugman injected students with gamma globulin, a type of antibody.  After observing the temporary protection against infection this antibody provided, he then tried injected live hepatitis virus into students.  Krugman also controversially took feces from infected students, blended it into milkshakes, and fed it to newly admitted children.[145]
 His research was received with much controversy, as people protested the questionable ethics surrounding the chosen target population.  Henry Beecher was one of the foremost critics in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1966, arguing that parents were unaware to the risks of consent and that the research was done to benefit others at the expense of children.[146]  Moreover, he argued that poor families with mentally disabled children often felt pressured to join the research project to gain admission to the school, with all of the educational and support resources that would come along with it.[147] Others in the medical community spoke out in support of Krugman's research in terms of its widespread benefits and understanding of the hepatitis virus, and Willowbrook continues to be a commonly cited example in debates about medical ethics.[148]
 The next insight regarding hepatitis B was a serendipitous one by Dr. Baruch Blumberg, a researcher at the NIH who did not set out to research hepatitis, but rather studied lipoprotein genetics.  He travelled across the globe collecting blood samples, investigating the interplay between disease, environment, and genetics with the goal of designing  targeted interventions for at-risk people that could prevent them from getting sick.[149]  He noticed an unexpected interaction between the blood of a patient with hemophilia that had received multiple transfusions and a protein found in the blood of an indigenous Australian person.[150]  He named the protein the ""Australia antigen"" and made it the focus of his research.  He found a higher prevalence of the protein in the blood of patients from developing countries, compared to those from developed ones, and noted associations of the antigen with other diseases like leukemia and Down Syndrome.[151]  Eventually, he came to the unifying conclusion that the Australia antigen was associated with viral hepatitis.
 In 1970, David Dane first isolated the hepatitis B virion at London's Middlesex Hospital, and named the virion the 42-nm ""Dane particle"".[147]  Based on its association with the surface of the hepatitis B virus, the Australia antigen was renamed to ""hepatitis B surface antigen"" or HBsAg.
 Blumberg continued to study the antigen, and eventually developed the first hepatitis B vaccine using plasma rich in HBsAg, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1976.[152]
 Overall, hepatitis accounts for a significant portion of healthcare expenditures in both developing and developed nations, and is expected to rise in several developing countries.[153][154] While hepatitis A infections are self-limited events, they are associated with significant costs in the United States.[155] It has been estimated that direct and indirect costs are approximately $1817 and $2459 respectively per case, and that an average of 27 work days is lost per infected adult.[155] A 1997 report demonstrated that a single hospitalization related to hepatitis A cost an average of $6,900 and resulted in around $500 million in total annual healthcare costs.[156] Cost effectiveness studies have found widespread vaccination of adults to not be feasible, but have stated that a combination hepatitis A and B vaccination of children and at risk groups (people from endemic areas, healthcare workers) may be.[157]
 Hepatitis B accounts for a much larger percentage of health care spending in endemic regions like Asia.[158][159] In 1997 it accounted for 3.2% of South Korea's total health care expenditures and resulted in $696 million in direct costs.[159] A large majority of that sum was spent on treating disease symptoms and complications.[160] Chronic hepatitis B infections are not as endemic in the United States, but accounted for $357 million in hospitalization costs in the year 1990.[153] That number grew to $1.5 billion in 2003, but remained stable as of 2006, which may be attributable to the introduction of effective drug therapies and vaccination campaigns.[153][154]
 People infected with chronic hepatitis C tend to be frequent users of the health care system globally.[161] It has been estimated that a person infected with hepatitis C in the United States will result in a monthly cost of $691.[161] That number nearly doubles to $1,227 for people with compensated (stable) cirrhosis, while the monthly cost of people with decompensated (worsening) cirrhosis is almost five times as large at $3,682.[161] The wide-ranging effects of hepatitis make it difficult to estimate indirect costs, but studies have speculated that the total cost is $6.5 billion annually in the United States.[153] In Canada, 56% of HCV related costs are attributable to cirrhosis and total expenditures related to the virus are expected to peak at CAD$396 million in the year 2032.[162]
 The largest outbreak of hepatitis A virus in United States history occurred among people who ate at a now-defunct Mexican food restaurant located in Monaca, Pennsylvania in late 2003.[163] Over 550 people who visited the restaurant between September and October 2003 were infected with the virus, three of whom died as a direct result.[163] The outbreak was brought to the attention of health officials when local emergency medicine physicians noticed a significant increase in  cases of hepatitis A in the county.[164] After conducting its investigation, the CDC attributed the source of the outbreak to the use of contaminated raw green onion. The restaurant was purchasing its green onion stock from farms in Mexico at the time.[163] It is believed that the green onions may have been contaminated through the use of contaminated water for crop irrigation, rinsing, or icing or by handling of the vegetables by infected people.[163] Green onion had caused similar outbreaks of hepatitis A in the southern United States prior to this, but not to the same magnitude.[163] The CDC believes that the restaurant's use of a large communal bucket for chopped raw green onion allowed non-contaminated plants to be mixed with contaminated ones, increasing the number of vectors of infection and amplifying the outbreak.[163] The restaurant was closed once it was discovered to be the source, and over 9,000 people were given hepatitis A immune globulin because they had either eaten at the restaurant or had been in close contact with someone who had.[163]
 Persons infected with HIV have a particularly high burden of HIV-HCV co-infection.[165][166]  In a recent study by the WHO, the likelihood of being infected with hepatitis C virus was six times greater in those who also had HIV.[166]  The prevalence of HIV-HCV co-infection worldwide was estimated to be 6.2% representing more than 2.2 million people.[166]  Intravenous drug use was an independent risk factor for HCV infection.[131] In the WHO study, the prevalence of HIV-HCV co-infection was markedly higher at 82.4% in those who injected drugs compared to the general population (2.4%).[166] In a study of HIV-HCV co-infection among HIV positive men who have sex with men (MSM), the overall prevalence of anti-hepatitis C antibodies was estimated to be 8.1% and increased to 40% among HIV positive MSM who also injected drugs.[165]
 Vertical transmission is a significant contributor of new HBV cases each year, with 35–50% of transmission from mother to neonate in endemic countries.[87][167] Vertical transmission occurs largely via a neonate's exposure to maternal blood and vaginal secretions during birth.[167] While the risk of progression to chronic infection is approximately 5% among adults who contract the virus, it is as high as 95% among neonates subject to vertical transmission.[87][168] The risk of viral transmission is approximately 10–20% when maternal blood is positive for HBsAg, and up to 90% when also positive for HBeAg.[87]
 Given the high risk of perinatal transmission, the CDC recommends screening all pregnant women for HBV at their first prenatal visit.[87][169] It is safe for non-immune pregnant women to receive the HBV vaccine.[87][167] Based on the limited available evidence, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends antiviral therapy in pregnant women whose viral load exceeds 200,000 IU/mL.[170] A growing body of evidence shows that antiviral therapy initiated in the third trimester significantly reduces transmission to the neonate.[167][170] A systematic review of the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry database found that there was no increased risk of congenital anomalies with Tenofovir; for this reason, along with its potency and low risk of resistance, the AASLD recommends this drug.[170][171] A 2010 systematic review and meta-analysis found that Lamivudine initiated early in the third trimester also significantly reduced mother-to-child transmission of HBV, without any known adverse effects.[172]
 The ACOG states that the evidence available does not suggest any particular mode of delivery (i.e. vaginal vs. cesarean) is better at reducing vertical transmission in mothers with HBV.[87]
 The WHO and CDC recommend that neonates born to mothers with HBV should receive hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) as well as the HBV vaccine within 12 hours of birth.[84][86] For infants who have received HBIG and the HBV vaccine, breastfeeding is safe.[87][167]
 Estimates of the rate of HCV vertical transmission range from 2–8%; a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found the risk to be 5.8% in HCV-positive, HIV-negative women.[87][173] The same study found the risk of vertical transmission to be 10.8% in HCV-positive, HIV-positive women.[173] Other studies have found the risk of vertical transmission to be as high as 44% among HIV-positive women.[87] The risk of vertical transmission is higher when the virus is detectable in the mother's blood.[173]
 Evidence does not indicate that mode of delivery (i.e. vaginal vs. cesarean) has an effect on vertical transmission.[87]
 For women who are HCV-positive and HIV-negative, breastfeeding is safe. CDC guidelines suggest avoiding it if a woman's nipples are cracked or bleeding to reduce the risk of transmission.[87][89]
 Pregnant women who contract HEV are at significant risk of developing fulminant hepatitis with maternal mortality rates as high as 20–30%, most commonly in the third trimester .[17][87][167] A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of 47 studies that included 3968 people found maternal case-fatality rates (CFR) of 20.8% and fetal CFR of 34.2%; among women who developed fulminant hepatic failure, CFR was 61.2%.[174]

 Hyper IgM syndrome is a rare primary immune deficiency disorders characterized by low or absent levels of serum IgG, IgA, IgE and normal or increased levels of serum IgM.[8]
 They are resulting from mutations in the pathway from B-cell activation to isotype class switching. Patients with HIGM are usually diagnosed within the first two years of life and experience severe immunosuppression. This syndrome is also known as immunoglobulin class switch recombination (Ig-CSR) deficiencies.[9] The most common causes are mutations in the CD40 Ligand (CD40LG) gene located at Xq26.3-27 leading to X-linked HIGM (XHIGM) in males.[10]
 Five types of hyper IgM syndrome have been characterized:
 The majority of patients with HIGM syndrome present with a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms even with a same genetic defects.[11] They usually develop symptoms in infancy and second year of life, including increased susceptibility to infections by extracellular bacteria, sinus & ear infections, skin infections. Furthermore, these patients are prone to pulmonary complications, gastrointestinal manifestations, autoimmune disorders, hematologic abnormalities, lymphoproloferation and malignancies. Heterozygous females in X-linked hyper IgM syndrome (HIGM1) are usually asymptomatic. However, immunologic testing has revealed that they exhibit reduced expression of CD40L when CD4+ T lymphocytes are activated. In some cases, females with significant reduction in circulating lymphocytes carrying the CD40L mutation due to skewed X-chromosome inactivation can present with symptoms resembling HIGM1 or common variable immunodeficiency.[12] Among the presentation consistent with hyper IgM syndrome are the following:[1][13]
 Different genetic defects cause HIgM syndrome, the vast majority are inherited as an X-linked recessive genetic trait and most with the condition are male.[7]
 IgM is the form of antibody that all B cells produce initially before they undergo class switching due to exposure to a recognized antigen. Healthy B cells efficiently switch to other types of antibodies as needed to attack invading bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. In people with hyper IgM syndromes, the B cells keep making IgM antibodies because they can't switch to a different antibody. This results in an overproduction of IgM antibodies and an underproduction of IgA, IgG, and IgE.[15][7]
 CD40 is a co-stimulatory receptor on B cells that, when bound to CD40 ligand (CD40L), sends a signal to the B-cell receptor.[16] Defective interaction of CD40L-CD40 between CD4+ T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) is known as the underlying cause of HIGM syndromes. CD40L-CD40 interaction is the first step in B cell stimulation for class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hyper mutation (SHM) resulting in the generation of various Ig isotypes.[8] Consequently, humoral immune response is affected. Certain insults, usually from encapsulated bacteria and toxin, then have a greater opportunity to damage the body.[1]
 The diagnosis of X-linked hyper IgM syndrome (HIGM1) is established in males with typical clinical and laboratory findings by identifying a hemizygous pathogenic variant in the CD40LG gene through molecular genetic testing. In females, the diagnosis of HIGM1 is extremely rare. Heterozygous females are usually asymptomatic unless there is skewed X-chromosome inactivation.[12] The diagnosis of hyper IgM syndrome can be done via the following methods and tests:[1]
 The primary goal is to address the underlying defect in CD40L or other gene mutations causing HIGM. The potential for precise correction of the CD40LG gene in T cells and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) to treat X-linked hyper-IgM Syndrome (HIGM1) is a promising avenue of research. However, the actual therapeutic efficacy of this approach is not yet fully understood and requires further investigation to determine its true potential. In addition to HSCT, supportive measures are crucial for managing infections and complications associated with HIGM. This may include antimicrobial prophylaxis, immunoglobulin replacement therapy, and close monitoring of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Additionally, anti-microbial therapy, use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, immunosuppressants, as well as other treatments, may be needed.[7][17]
 All forms of hyper-IgM syndrome are rare. According to the US X-HIGM registry, the prevalence of X-linked hyper IgM syndrome (X-HIGM) during the period from 1984 to 1993 was approximately 1 in 1,000,000 live births. The estimated frequency of CD40L deficiency, a subtype of X-HIGM, is 2 in 1,000,000 in males. Limited data is available on the frequency of AICDA deficiency, another subtype of X-HIGM, but it is believed to affect less than 1 in 1,000,000 individuals. Globally, all forms of HIGM make up approximately 0.3% to 2.9% of all patients diagnosed with primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs).[8]

"High blood pressure is a common condition that affects the body's arteries. It's also called hypertension. If you have high blood pressure, the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls is consistently too high. The heart has to work harder to pump blood. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). In general, hypertension is a blood pressure reading of 130/80 mm Hg or higher. The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association divide blood pressure into four general categories. Ideal blood pressure is categorized as normal.) Blood pressure higher than 180/120 mm Hg is considered a hypertensive emergency or crisis. Seek emergency medical help for anyone with these blood pressure numbers. Untreated, high blood pressure increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and other serious health problems. It's important to have your blood pressure checked at least every two years starting at age 18. Some people need more-frequent checks. Healthy lifestyle habits —such as not smoking, exercising and eating well — can help prevent and treat high blood pressure. Some people need medicine to treat high blood pressure.

Most people with high blood pressure have no symptoms, even if blood pressure readings reach dangerously high levels. You can have high blood pressure for years without any symptoms. A few people with high blood pressure may have: However, these symptoms aren't specific. They usually don't occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe or life-threatening stage. Blood pressure screening is an important part of general health care. How often you should get your blood pressure checked depends on your age and overall health. Ask your provider for a blood pressure reading at least every two years starting at age 18. If you're age 40 or older, or you're 18 to 39 with a high risk of high blood pressure, ask for a blood pressure check every year. Your care provider will likely recommend more-frequent readings if have high blood pressure or other risk factors for heart disease. Children age 3 and older may have blood pressure measured as a part of their yearly checkups. If you don't regularly see a care provider, you may be able to get a free blood pressure screening at a health resource fair or other locations in your community. Free blood pressure machines are also available in some stores and pharmacies. The accuracy of these machines depends on several things, such as a correct cuff size and proper use of the machines. Ask your health care provider for advice on using public blood pressure machines. Blood pressure is determined by two things: the amount of blood the heart pumps and how hard it is for the blood to move through the arteries. The more blood the heart pumps and the narrower the arteries, the higher the blood pressure. There are two main types of high blood pressure. For most adults, there's no identifiable cause of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure is called primary hypertension or essential hypertension. It tends to develop gradually over many years. Plaque buildup in the arteries, called atherosclerosis, increases the risk of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure is caused by an underlying condition. It tends to appear suddenly and cause higher blood pressure than does primary hypertension. Conditions and medicines that can lead to secondary hypertension include: Sometimes just getting a health checkup causes blood pressure to increase. This is called white coat hypertension. High blood pressure has many risk factors, including: High blood pressure is most common in adults. But kids can have high blood pressure too. High blood pressure in children may be caused by problems with the kidneys or heart. But for a growing number of kids, high blood pressure is due to lifestyle habits such as an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise. The excessive pressure on the artery walls caused by high blood pressure can damage blood vessels and body organs. The higher the blood pressure and the longer it goes uncontrolled, the greater the damage.

"High blood pressure (hypertension) has no symptoms and can be dangerous if not treated. Hypertension puts you at risk for stroke, heart attack and other problems. Nearly half of adults who have hypertension don’t realize it. So, checkups are crucial. Dietary changes, exercise and medicine can help you keep your blood pressure where it should be. High blood pressure is when the force of blood pushing against your artery walls is consistently too high. This damages your arteries over time and can lead to serious complications like heart attack and stroke. “Hypertension” is another word for this common condition. Healthcare providers call high blood pressure a “silent killer” because you usually don’t have any symptoms. So, you may not be aware that anything is wrong, but the damage is still occurring within your body. Blood pressure (BP) is the measurement of the pressure or force of blood pushing against blood vessel walls. Your BP reading has two numbers: Healthcare providers measure blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Getting your blood pressure checked is the only way to know if it’s too high. You can do this by seeing a healthcare provider for a yearly checkup, even if you feel healthy. You won’t feel sick if you have high blood pressure. So, these checkups are crucial and can be life-saving. If your BP is above the normal range, your provider will recommend lifestyle changes and/or medications to lower your numbers. Definitions of high blood pressure vary slightly depending on where you live. In the U.S., healthcare providers define high blood pressure (hypertension) as: In Europe, healthcare providers define hypertension as: High blood pressure is very common. It affects 47% of adults in the U.S. This equals about 116 million people. Of those, 37 million have a blood pressure of at least 140/90 mmHg. High blood pressure caused or contributed to over 670,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2020. The World Health Organization estimates that globally, over 1.2 billion people ages 30 to 79 have hypertension. About 2 in 3 of those individuals live in low- or middle-income countries. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Usually, high blood pressure causes no signs or symptoms. That’s why healthcare providers call it a “silent killer.” You could have high blood pressure for years and not know it. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that 46% of adults with hypertension don’t know they have it. When your blood pressure is 180/120 mmHg or higher, you may experience symptoms like headaches, heart palpitations or nosebleeds. Blood pressure this high is a hypertensive crisis that requires immediate medical care. Your provider will diagnose you with one of two types of high blood pressure: Primary and secondary high blood pressure (hypertension) can co-exist. For example, a new secondary cause can make blood pressure that’s already high get even higher. You might also hear about high blood pressure that comes or goes in certain situations. These hypertension types are: Advertisement Primary hypertension doesn’t have a single, clear cause. Usually, many factors come together to cause it. Common causes include: Secondary hypertension has at least one distinct cause that healthcare providers can identify. Common causes of secondary hypertension include: Researchers believe genes play a role in high blood pressure. If one or more of your close biological family members have high blood pressure, you have an increased risk of developing it, too. Risk factors that make you more likely to have high blood pressure include: Untreated hypertension may lead to serious health problems including: Advertisement Healthcare providers diagnose high blood pressure by measuring it with an arm cuff. Providers usually measure your blood pressure at annual checkups and other appointments. If you have high blood pressure readings at two or more appointments, your provider may tell you that you have high blood pressure. They’ll talk to you about your medical history and lifestyle to identify possible causes. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued new blood pressure guidelines. Healthcare providers in the U.S. use these when diagnosing and treating high blood pressure. The guidelines divide blood pressure readings into four categories, listed in the chart below. You have high blood pressure if you fall into the stage 1 hypertension or stage 2 hypertension categories.   In the U.S., a high blood pressure diagnosis means your top number is at least 130 and/or your bottom number is at least 80. High blood pressure treatments include lifestyle changes and medications. Healthcare providers recommend treatment based on your blood pressure readings, the causes of your high blood pressure and your underlying conditions. You may be wondering if you can lower your blood pressure naturally. Yes, in some cases, it’s possible to lower your blood pressure without medication. For example, your provider may recommend starting with lifestyle changes if you have elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension. Here are some proven ways to lower your blood pressure naturally: Sometimes, providers recommend lifestyle changes along with medications to lower your blood pressure. Four classes of blood pressure medications are “first-line” (most effective and commonly prescribed) when starting treatment: Your provider may couple other medications with these first-line drugs to better manage your blood pressure. Talk to your provider about possible side effects. If you get side effects that concern you, call your provider. They may change your dose or try a different medication. Don’t stop taking the medicine on your own. You should avoid some medications during pregnancy. So, be sure to tell your provider if you’re pregnant or could become pregnant. Fortunately, there are things you can do to reduce your risk of developing high blood pressure. These include: Since high blood pressure doesn’t cause symptoms, you probably won’t feel any different with a high blood pressure diagnosis. But it’s important to follow your provider’s instructions to bring your blood pressure down so it doesn’t cause complications later on. Once high blood pressure leads to complications, you may start to feel symptoms of conditions like coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. These include: Your provider may recommend you check your blood pressure regularly with a home blood pressure monitor. These are automated electronic monitors you can purchase at most pharmacies or online. For some people, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is necessary. If you have primary high blood pressure, you’ll need to manage it for the rest of your life. If you have secondary high blood pressure, your blood pressure will most likely come down after you receive treatment for the medical problem that caused it. If a medication caused your high blood pressure, switching to a different medicine may lower your blood pressure. See your provider for yearly checkups. They’ll monitor your blood pressure and recommend treatment, if needed, to help you stay healthy. Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have sudden symptoms of a hypertensive crisis. These include: Questions that can help you learn more about your risk for high blood pressure or ways to manage existing high blood pressure include: Research supports the DASH diet as a way to lower blood pressure naturally. Increasing potassium and reducing sodium through your food choices are specific strategies. You may read about many other dietary methods for lowering your blood pressure. These methods don’t have the same level or quality of evidence to support their effectiveness. They include: Be a cautious consumer, and talk with your healthcare provider to learn more. A note from Cleveland Clinic High blood pressure is a serious but silent condition that can sneak up on you over the years. Seeing a healthcare provider for regular checkups can help you learn your numbers.

 High blood pressure (also called hypertension) can lead to serious problems like heart attacks or strokes. But lifestyle changes and blood pressure medicines can help you stay healthy. High blood pressure is very common, especially in older adults. There are usually no symptoms, so you may not realise you have it. Things that increase your chances of having high blood pressure include: Some pharmacies may charge for a blood pressure check. Some workplaces also offer blood pressure checks. Check with your employer. Many pharmacies offer free blood pressure checks for people aged 40 or over. Find a pharmacy that offers free blood pressure checks High blood pressure does not usually cause any symptoms. Many people have it without realising it. Rarely, high blood pressure can cause symptoms such as: But the only way to find out if you have high blood pressure is to get your blood pressure checked. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online. You could be having a heart attack. Call 999 straight away as you need immediate treatment in hospital. Do not drive yourself to A&E.  The person you speak to at 999 will give you advice about what to do. A blood pressure test involves inflating a band (cuff) around your upper arm and measuring the pressure in your blood vessels. If the test shows you might have high blood pressure, you may be asked to: This can confirm if you have high blood pressure. Blood pressure readings are given as 2 numbers, with the 1st number higher than the 2nd (for example, 130/80). If you're under 80 years of age, you're usually considered to have high blood pressure if your reading is either: If you're aged 80 or over, you're usually considered to have high blood pressure if your reading is either: Use our check your blood pressure reading tool to see your reading on a chart and understand what it means. If your blood pressure is too high, it puts extra strain on your blood vessels, heart and other organs, such as your brain, kidneys and eyes. If it's not treated, it can increase your risk of serious conditions such as: Lowering your blood pressure even a small amount can help reduce your risk of these problems. Healthy lifestyle changes can help lower your blood pressure. have a healthy, balanced diet exercise regularly – aim to do at least 150 minutes of exercise a week lose weight if you're overweight do not eat too much salt – avoid salty food or adding salt to your meals do not drink too much alcohol – avoid drinking more than 14 alcohol units a week on a regular basis do not drink too much caffeine – drinks high in caffeine include coffee, tea and cola do not smoke NHS Better Health has free tools and support to help you lose weight, get active, quit smoking and drink less. Visit the NHS Better Health website A GP will usually prescribe medicine for high blood pressure if: There are lots of different medicines for high blood pressure. The medicine recommended for you depends on things like how high your blood pressure is, your age and your ethnicity. Most blood pressure medicines are taken as tablets once a day. You may need to take more than 1 medicine to keep your blood pressure under control. You can get more information and advice about high blood pressure from:

"You may be more likely to have high blood pressure due to your genetics, age, and whether you have certain health conditions. Treatment may include medication. Your blood pressure measurement takes into account how much blood is passing through your blood vessels and the amount of resistance the blood meets while the heart is pumping.  High blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when the force of blood pushing through your vessels is consistently too high. In this article, we’ll cover the basics of hypertension, including its symptoms, causes, how it’s treated, and more.  Narrow blood vessels, also known as arteries, create more resistance for blood flow. The narrower your arteries are, the more resistance there is, and the higher your blood pressure will be. Over the long term, the increased pressure can cause health issues, including heart disease. Hypertension is quite common. In fact, since the guidelines changed in 2017, nearly half of American adults could now be diagnosed with this condition. Hypertension typically develops over the course of several years. Usually, you don’t notice any symptoms. But even without symptoms, high blood pressure can cause damage to your blood vessels and organs, especially the brain, heart, eyes, and kidneys. Early detection is important. Regular blood pressure readings can help you and your doctor notice any changes. If your blood pressure is elevated, your doctor may have you check your blood pressure over a few weeks to see if the number stays elevated or falls back to normal levels. Treatment for hypertension includes both prescription medication and healthy lifestyle changes. If the condition isn’t treated, it could lead to health issues, including heart attack and stroke. Two numbers create a blood pressure reading. Systolic pressure (top number) indicates the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats and pumps out blood. Diastolic pressure (bottom number) is the reading of the pressure in your arteries between beats of your heart. Five categories define blood pressure readings for adults: A blood pressure reading is taken with a pressure cuff. For an accurate reading, it’s important you have a cuff that fits. An ill-fitting cuff may deliver inaccurate readings. Blood pressure readings are different for children and teenagers. Ask your child’s doctor for the healthy ranges for your child if you’re asked to monitor their blood pressure. Hypertension is generally a silent condition. Many people won’t experience any symptoms. It may take years or even decades for the condition to reach levels severe enough that symptoms become obvious. Even then, these symptoms may be attributed to other issues. Symptoms of severe hypertension can include: According to the American Heart Association, contrary to popular thought, severe hypertension doesn’t typically cause nosebleeds or headaches — except when someone is in hypertensive crisis.  The best way to know if you have hypertension is to get regular blood pressure readings. Most doctors’ offices take a blood pressure reading at every appointment. If you only have a yearly physical, talk with your doctor about your risks for hypertension and other readings you may need to help you watch your blood pressure. For example, if you have a family history of heart disease or have risk factors for developing the condition, your doctor may recommend that you have your blood pressure checked twice a year. This helps you and your doctor stay on top of any possible issues before they become problematic. There are two types of hypertension. Each type has a different cause. Essential hypertension is also called primary hypertension. This kind of hypertension develops over time. Most people have this type of high blood pressure. A combination of factors typically play a role in the development of essential hypertension: Secondary hypertension often occurs quickly and can become more severe than primary hypertension. Several conditions that may cause secondary hypertension include: Diagnosing hypertension is as simple as taking a blood pressure reading. Most doctors’ offices check blood pressure as part of a routine visit. If you don’t receive a blood pressure reading at your next appointment, request one. If your blood pressure is elevated, your doctor may request you have more readings over the course of a few days or weeks. A hypertension diagnosis is rarely given after just one reading.  Your doctor needs to see evidence of a sustained problem. That’s because your environment can contribute to increased blood pressure, like the stress you may feel by being at the doctor’s office. Also, blood pressure levels change throughout the day. If your blood pressure remains high, your doctor will likely conduct more tests to rule out underlying conditions. These tests can include: These tests can help your doctor identify any secondary issues causing your elevated blood pressure. They can also look at the effects high blood pressure may have had on your organs. During this time, your doctor may begin treating your hypertension. Early treatment may reduce your risk of lasting damage. A number of factors help your doctor determine the best treatment option for you. These factors include which type of hypertension you have and what causes have been identified. If your doctor diagnoses you with primary hypertension, lifestyle changes may help reduce your high blood pressure. If lifestyle changes alone aren’t enough, or if they stop being effective, your doctor may prescribe medication. If your doctor discovers an underlying issue causing your hypertension, treatment will focus on that other condition. For example, if a medication you’ve started taking is causing increased blood pressure, your doctor will try other medications that don’t have this side effect. Sometimes, hypertension is persistent despite treatment for the underlying cause. In this case, your doctor may work with you to develop lifestyle changes and prescribe medications to help reduce your blood pressure. Treatment plans for hypertension often evolve. What worked at first may become less useful over time. Your doctor will continue to work with you to refine your treatment. Many people go through a trial-and-error phase with blood pressure medications. Your doctor may need to try different medications until they find one or a combination that works for you. Some of the medications used to treat hypertension include: Healthy lifestyle changes can help you control the factors that cause hypertension. Here are some of the most common ones. A heart-healthy diet is vital for helping to reduce high blood pressure. It’s also important for managing hypertension that’s under control and reducing the risk of complications. These complications include heart disease, stroke, and heart attack. A heart-healthy diet emphasizes: In addition to helping you lose weight (if your doctor has recommended it), exercise can help lower blood pressure naturally, and strengthen your cardiovascular system. Aim to get 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week. That’s about 30 minutes, 5 times per week. If you’re living with obesity, maintaining a moderate weight with a heart-healthy diet and increased physical activity can help lower your blood pressure. Exercise is a great way to manage stress. Other activities can also be helpful. These include: Getting adequate sleep may also help reduce stress levels. If you’re a smoker and have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, your doctor will most likely advise you to quit. The chemicals in tobacco smoke can damage the body’s tissues and harden blood vessel walls. If you regularly consume too much alcohol or have an alcohol dependency, seek help to reduce the amount you drink or stop altogether. Drinking alcohol in excess can raise blood pressure. If you have risk factors for hypertension, you can take steps now to lower your risk for the condition and its complications. Slowly work your way up to eating more servings of heart-healthy plants. Aim to eat more than seven servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Then aim to add one more serving per day for 2 weeks. After those 2 weeks, aim to add one more serving. The goal is to have 10 servings of fruits and vegetables per day. Try to limit the amount of sugar-sweetened foods, like flavored yogurts, cereals, and sodas, you eat on a daily basis. Packaged foods hide unnecessary sugar, so be sure to read labels. People living with hypertension and those with an increased risk for heart disease may be advised by their doctor to keep their daily sodium intake between 1,500 milligrams and 2,300 milligrams per day.  The best way to reduce sodium is to cook fresh foods more often and limit the amount of fast food or prepackaged food you eat, which can sometimes be very high in sodium. If your doctor has recommended you lose weight, talk with them about an optimal weight loss goal for you. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a weight loss goal of one to two pounds a week. This can be achieved through a more nutritious diet and increased physical exercise.  Employing the help of a trainer or fitness app, and possibly even a dietician, are all methods to help you learn how to make the best choices for your body and your lifestyle. The best way to prevent complications and avoid problems is to recognize hypertension early.  Keep a log of your blood pressure readings and take it to your regular doctor appointments. This can help your doctor see any possible problems before the condition advances. People with hypertension can deliver healthy babies despite having the condition. But it can be dangerous to both the birthing parent and baby if it’s not monitored closely and managed during the pregnancy. People with high blood pressure who become pregnant are more likely to develop complications. For example, pregnant women with hypertension may experience decreased kidney function. Babies born to birthing parents with hypertension may have a low birth weight or be born prematurely. Some people may develop hypertension during their pregnancies. Several types of high blood pressure problems can develop. The condition often reverses itself once the baby is born. Developing hypertension during pregnancy may increase your risk for developing hypertension later in life. In some cases, pregnant people with hypertension may develop preeclampsia during their pregnancy. This condition of increased blood pressure can cause kidney and other organ complications. This can result in high protein levels in the urine, problems with liver function, fluid in the lungs, or visual problems. As this condition worsens, the risks increase for the mother and baby. Preeclampsia can lead to eclampsia, which causes seizures. High blood pressure problems in pregnancy remain an important cause of maternal death in the United States. Complications for the baby include low birth weight, early birth, and stillbirth. There’s no known way to prevent preeclampsia, and the only way to treat the condition is to deliver the baby. If you develop this condition during your pregnancy, your doctor will closely monitor you for complications. Because hypertension is often a silent condition, it can cause damage to your body for years before symptoms become obvious. If hypertension isn’t treated, you may face serious, even fatal, complications. Complications of hypertension include the following. Healthy arteries are flexible and strong. Blood flows freely and unobstructed through healthy arteries and vessels.  Hypertension makes arteries tougher, tighter, and less elastic. This damage makes it easier for dietary fats to deposit in your arteries and restrict blood flow. This damage can lead to increased blood pressure, blockages, and, eventually, heart attack and stroke. Hypertension makes your heart work too hard. The increased pressure in your blood vessels forces your heart’s muscles to pump more frequently and with more force than a healthy heart should have to. This may cause an enlarged heart. An enlarged heart increases your risk for the following: Your brain relies on a healthy supply of oxygen-rich blood to work properly. Untreated high blood pressure can reduce your brain’s supply of blood: Uncontrolled hypertension may also affect your memory and ability to learn, recall, speak, and reason. Treating hypertension often doesn’t erase or reverse the effects of uncontrolled hypertension. But it does lower the risks for future problems. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a very common health issue in the United States.  If you’ve recently been diagnosed with high blood pressure, your treatment plan will vary depending on factors. These include the severity of your high blood pressure, and what medication your doctor thinks will work best for you. The good news is that in many cases of hypertension, lifestyle changes can be powerful tools for managing, or even reversing, your diagnosis. These changes include incorporating more nutritious fruits and vegetables into your diet, getting more physical activity, limiting your sodium intake, and limiting your alcohol consumption. Because hypertension often presents with no symptoms, it’s important to get your blood pressure checked during your yearly physicals. Severe hypertension can cause serious health issues, so the sooner you have it diagnosed, the sooner it can be managed — and possibly even reversed!

 Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated.[11] High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms itself.[1] It is, however, a major risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, vision loss, chronic kidney disease, and dementia.[2][3][4][12] Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide.[13]
 High blood pressure is classified as primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension.[5] About 90–95% of cases are primary, defined as high blood pressure due to nonspecific lifestyle and genetic factors.[5] Lifestyle factors that increase the risk include excess salt in the diet, excess body weight, smoking, physical inactivity and alcohol use.[1][5] The remaining 5–10% of cases are categorized as secondary hypertension, defined as high blood pressure due to a clearly identifiable cause, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the kidney arteries, an endocrine disorder, or the use of birth control pills.[5]
 Blood pressure is classified by two measurements, the systolic (first number) and diastolic (second number) pressures.[1] For most adults, normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100–140 millimeters mercury (mmHg) systolic and 60–90 mmHg diastolic.[6][7] For most adults, high blood pressure is present if the resting blood pressure is persistently at or above 130/80 or 140/90 mmHg.[5][6][7] Different numbers apply to children.[14] Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period appears more accurate than office-based blood pressure measurement.[5][11]
 Lifestyle changes and medications can lower blood pressure and decrease the risk of health complications.[8] Lifestyle changes include weight loss, physical exercise, decreased salt intake, reducing alcohol intake, and a healthy diet.[5] If lifestyle changes are not sufficient, blood pressure medications are used.[8] Up to three medications taken concurrently can control blood pressure in 90% of people.[5] The treatment of moderately high arterial blood pressure (defined as >160/100 mmHg) with medications is associated with an improved life expectancy.[15] The effect of treatment of blood pressure between 130/80 mmHg and 160/100 mmHg is less clear, with some reviews finding benefit[6][16][17] and others finding unclear benefit.[18][19][20] High blood pressure affects 33% of the population globally.[9] About half of all people with high blood pressure do not know that they have it.[9] In 2019, high blood pressure was believed to have been a factor in 19% of all deaths (10.4 million globally).[9]
 Hypertension is rarely accompanied by symptoms.[1] Half of all people with hypertension are unaware that they have it.[9] Hypertension is usually identified as part of health screening or when seeking healthcare for an unrelated problem.
 Some people with high blood pressure report headaches, as well as lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus (buzzing or hissing in the ears), altered vision or fainting episodes.[21] These symptoms, however, might be related to associated anxiety rather than the high blood pressure itself.[22]
 Long-standing untreated hypertension can cause organ damage with signs such as changes in the optic fundus seen by ophthalmoscopy.[23] The severity of hypertensive retinopathy correlates roughly with the duration or the severity of the hypertension.[21] Other hypertension-caused organ damage include chronic kidney disease and thickening of the heart muscle.[9]
 Secondary hypertension is hypertension due to an identifiable cause, and may result in certain specific additional signs and symptoms. For example, as well as causing high blood pressure, Cushing's syndrome frequently causes truncal obesity,[24] glucose intolerance, moon face, a hump of fat behind the neck and shoulders (referred to as a buffalo hump), and purple abdominal stretch marks.[25] Hyperthyroidism frequently causes weight loss with increased appetite, fast heart rate, bulging eyes, and tremor. Renal artery stenosis may be associated with a localized abdominal bruit to the left or right of the midline, or in both locations. Coarctation of the aorta frequently causes a decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities relative to the arms, or delayed or absent femoral arterial pulses. Pheochromocytoma may cause abrupt episodes of hypertension accompanied by headache, palpitations, pale appearance, and excessive sweating.[25]
 Severely elevated blood pressure (equal to or greater than a systolic 180 mmHg or diastolic of 120 mmHg) is referred to as a hypertensive crisis.[26] Hypertensive crisis is categorized as either hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency, according to the absence or presence of end organ damage, respectively.[27][28]
 In hypertensive urgency, there is no evidence of end organ damage resulting from the elevated blood pressure. In these cases, oral medications are used to lower the BP gradually over 24 to 48 hours.[29]
 In hypertensive emergency, there is evidence of direct damage to one or more organs.[30][31] The most affected organs include the brain, kidney, heart and lungs, producing symptoms which may include confusion, drowsiness, chest pain and breathlessness.[29] In hypertensive emergency, the blood pressure must be reduced more rapidly to stop ongoing organ damage;[29] however, there is a lack of randomized controlled trial evidence for this approach.[31]
 Hypertension occurs in approximately 8–10% of pregnancies.[25] Two blood pressure measurements six hours apart of greater than 140/90 mmHg are diagnostic of hypertension in pregnancy.[32] High blood pressure in pregnancy can be classified as pre-existing hypertension, gestational hypertension, or pre-eclampsia.[33] Women who have chronic hypertension before their pregnancy are at increased risk of complications such as premature birth, low birthweight or stillbirth.[34] Women who have high blood pressure and had complications in their pregnancy have three times the risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to women with normal blood pressure who had no complications in pregnancy.[35][36]
 Pre-eclampsia is a serious condition of the second half of pregnancy and following delivery characterised by increased blood pressure and the presence of protein in the urine.[25] It occurs in about 5% of pregnancies and is responsible for approximately 16% of all maternal deaths globally.[25] Pre-eclampsia also doubles the risk of death of the baby around the time of birth.[25] Usually there are no symptoms in pre-eclampsia and it is detected by routine screening. When symptoms of pre-eclampsia occur the most common are headache, visual disturbance (often ""flashing lights""), vomiting, pain over the stomach, and swelling. Pre-eclampsia can occasionally progress to a life-threatening condition called eclampsia, which is a hypertensive emergency and has several serious complications including vision loss, brain swelling, seizures, kidney failure, pulmonary edema, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (a blood clotting disorder).[25][37]
 In contrast, gestational hypertension is defined as new-onset hypertension during pregnancy without protein in the urine.[33]
 Failure to thrive, seizures, irritability, lack of energy, and difficulty in breathing[38] can be associated with hypertension in newborns and young infants. In older infants and children, hypertension can cause headache, unexplained irritability, fatigue, failure to thrive, blurred vision, nosebleeds, and facial paralysis.[38][39]
 Hypertension results from a complex interaction of genes and environmental factors. Numerous common genetic variants with small effects on blood pressure have been identified[40] as well as some rare genetic variants with large effects on blood pressure.[41] Also, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 35 genetic loci related to blood pressure; 12 of these genetic loci influencing blood pressure were newly found.[42] Sentinel SNP for each new genetic locus identified has shown an association with DNA methylation at multiple nearby CpG sites. These sentinel SNP are located within genes related to vascular smooth muscle and renal function. DNA methylation might affect in some way linking common genetic variation to multiple phenotypes even though mechanisms underlying these associations are not understood. Single variant test performed in this study for the 35 sentinel SNP (known and new) showed that genetic variants singly or in aggregate contribute to risk of clinical phenotypes related to high blood pressure.[42]
 Blood pressure rises with aging when associated with a western diet and lifestyle and the risk of becoming hypertensive in later life is significant.[43][44] Several environmental factors influence blood pressure. High salt intake raises the blood pressure in salt sensitive individuals; lack of exercise and central obesity can play a role in individual cases. The possible roles of other factors such as caffeine consumption,[45] and vitamin D deficiency[46] are less clear. Insulin resistance, which is common in obesity and is a component of syndrome X (or the metabolic syndrome), also contributes to hypertension.[47]
 Events in early life, such as low birth weight, maternal smoking, and lack of breastfeeding may be risk factors for adult essential hypertension, although the mechanisms linking these exposures to adult hypertension remain unclear.[48] An increased rate of high blood uric acid has been found in untreated people with hypertension in comparison with people with normal blood pressure, although it is uncertain whether the former plays a causal role or is subsidiary to poor kidney function.[49] Average blood pressure may be higher in the winter than in the summer.[50] Periodontal disease is also associated with high blood pressure.[51]
 Secondary hypertension results from an identifiable cause. Kidney disease is the most common secondary cause of hypertension.[25] Hypertension can also be caused by endocrine conditions, such as Cushing's syndrome, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, Conn's syndrome or hyperaldosteronism, renal artery stenosis (from atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia), hyperparathyroidism, and pheochromocytoma.[25][52] Other causes of secondary hypertension include obesity, sleep apnea, pregnancy, coarctation of the aorta, excessive eating of liquorice, excessive drinking of alcohol, certain prescription medicines, herbal remedies, and stimulants such as coffee, cocaine and methamphetamine.[25][53] Arsenic exposure through drinking water has been shown to correlate with elevated blood pressure.[54][55] Depression was also linked to hypertension.[56] Loneliness is also a risk factor.[57] Air pollution may be associated with hypertension.[58]
 A 2018 review found that any alcohol increased blood pressure in males while over one or two drinks increased the risk in females.[59]
 In most people with established essential hypertension, increased resistance to blood flow (total peripheral resistance) accounts for the high pressure while cardiac output remains normal.[60] There is evidence that some younger people with prehypertension or 'borderline hypertension' have high cardiac output, an elevated heart rate and normal peripheral resistance, termed hyperkinetic borderline hypertension.[61] These individuals develop the typical features of established essential hypertension in later life as their cardiac output falls and peripheral resistance rises with age.[61] Whether this pattern is typical of all people who ultimately develop hypertension is disputed.[62] The increased peripheral resistance in established hypertension is mainly attributable to structural narrowing of small arteries and arterioles,[63] although a reduction in the number or density of capillaries may also contribute.[64]
 It is not clear whether or not vasoconstriction of arteriolar blood vessels plays a role in hypertension.[65] Hypertension is also associated with decreased peripheral venous compliance,[66] which may increase venous return, increase cardiac preload and, ultimately, cause diastolic dysfunction. For patients having hypertension, higher heart rate variability (HRV) is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation.[67]
 Pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure) is frequently increased in older people with hypertension.[68] This can mean that systolic pressure is abnormally high, but diastolic pressure may be normal or low, a condition termed isolated systolic hypertension.[69] The high pulse pressure in elderly people with hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension is explained by increased arterial stiffness, which typically accompanies aging and may be exacerbated by high blood pressure.[70]
 Many mechanisms have been proposed to account for the rise in peripheral resistance in hypertension. Most evidence implicates either disturbances in the kidneys' salt and water handling (particularly abnormalities in the intrarenal renin–angiotensin system)[71] or abnormalities of the sympathetic nervous system.[72] These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and it is likely that both contribute to some extent in most cases of essential hypertension. It has also been suggested that endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation may also contribute to increased peripheral resistance and vascular damage in hypertension.[73][74] Interleukin 17 has garnered interest for its role in increasing the production of several other immune system chemical signals thought to be involved in hypertension such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8.[75]
 Excessive sodium or insufficient potassium in the diet leads to excessive intracellular sodium, which contracts vascular smooth muscle, restricting blood flow and so increases blood pressure.[76][77] Non-modulating essential hypertension is a form of salt-sensitive hypertension, where sodium intake does not modulate either adrenal or renal vascular responses to angiotensin II.[78] They make up 25% of the hypertensive population.[79]
 Hypertension is diagnosed on the basis of a persistently high resting blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure measurements on at least two separate occasions is required for a diagnosis of hypertension.[6][7][13]
 For an accurate diagnosis of hypertension to be made, it is essential for proper blood pressure measurement technique to be used.[80] Improper measurement of blood pressure is common and can change the blood pressure reading by up to 10 mmHg, which can lead to misdiagnosis and misclassification of hypertension.[80] Correct blood pressure measurement technique involves several steps. Proper blood pressure measurement requires the person whose blood pressure is being measured to sit quietly for at least five minutes which is then followed by application of a properly fitted blood pressure cuff to a bare upper arm.[80] The person should be seated with their back supported, feet flat on the floor, and with their legs uncrossed.[80] The person whose blood pressure is being measured should avoid talking or moving during this process.[80] The arm being measured should be supported on a flat surface at the level of the heart.[80] Blood pressure measurement should be done in a quiet room so the medical professional checking the blood pressure can hear the Korotkoff sounds while listening to the brachial artery with a stethoscope for accurate blood pressure measurements.[80][81] The blood pressure cuff should be deflated slowly (2–3 mmHg per second) while listening for the Korotkoff sounds.[81] The bladder should be emptied before a person's blood pressure is measured since this can increase blood pressure by up to 15/10 mmHg.[80] Multiple blood pressure readings (at least two) spaced 1–2 minutes apart should be obtained to ensure accuracy.[81] Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over 12 to 24 hours is the most accurate method to confirm the diagnosis.[82] An exception to this is those with very high blood pressure readings especially when there is poor organ function.[83]
 With the availability of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitors and home blood pressure machines, the importance of not wrongly diagnosing those who have white coat hypertension has led to a change in protocols. In the United Kingdom, current best practice is to follow up a single raised clinic reading with ambulatory measurement, or less ideally with home blood pressure monitoring over the course of 7 days.[83] The United States Preventive Services Task Force also recommends getting measurements outside of the healthcare environment.[82] Pseudohypertension in the elderly or noncompressibility artery syndrome may also require consideration. This condition is believed to be due to calcification of the arteries resulting in abnormally high blood pressure readings with a blood pressure cuff while intra arterial measurements of blood pressure are normal.[84] Orthostatic hypertension is when blood pressure increases upon standing.[85]
 
Once the diagnosis of hypertension has been made, further testing may be performed to find secondary hypertension, identify comorbidities such as diabetes, identify hypertension-caused organ damage such as chronic kidney disease or thickening of the heart muscle, and for cardiovascular disease risk stratification.[9]
 Secondary hypertension is more common in preadolescent children, with most cases caused by kidney disease. Primary or essential hypertension is more common in adolescents and adults and has multiple risk factors, including obesity and a family history of hypertension.[86]
 Initial assessment upon diagnosis of hypertension should include a complete history and physical examination. The World Health Organization suggests the following initial tests: serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, lipid panel, HbA1c or fasting glucose, urine dipstick and electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG).[9] Serum creatinine is measured to assess for the presence of kidney disease, which can be either the cause or the result of hypertension.[30] eGFR can also provide a baseline measurement of kidney function that can be used to monitor for side effects of certain anti-hypertensive drugs on kidney function. Testing of urine samples for protein is used as a secondary indicator of kidney disease. Lipid panel and glucose tests are done to identify comorbidities such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia and for cardiovascular risk stratification. Electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG) testing is done to check for evidence that the heart is under strain from high blood pressure, such as thickening of the heart muscle or whether the heart has experienced a prior minor disturbance such as a silent heart attack.
 In people aged 18 years or older, hypertension is defined as either a systolic or a diastolic blood pressure measurement consistently higher than an accepted normal value (this is above 129 or 139 mmHg systolic, 89 mmHg diastolic depending on the guideline).[5][6] Lower thresholds are used if measurements are derived from 24-hour ambulatory or home monitoring.[88]
 Hypertension occurs in around 0.2 to 3% of newborns; however, blood pressure is not measured routinely in healthy newborns.[39] Hypertension is more common in high risk newborns. A variety of factors, such as gestational age, postconceptional age and birth weight needs to be taken into account when deciding if a blood pressure is normal in a newborn.[39]
 Hypertension defined as elevated blood pressure over several visits affects 1% to 5% of children and adolescents and is associated with long-term risks of ill-health.[89] Blood pressure rises with age in childhood and, in children, hypertension is defined as an average systolic or diastolic blood pressure on three or more occasions equal or higher than the 95th percentile appropriate for the sex, age and height of the child. High blood pressure must be confirmed on repeated visits however before characterizing a child as having hypertension.[89] In adolescents, it has been proposed that hypertension is diagnosed and classified using the same criteria as in adults.[89]
 Much of the disease burden of high blood pressure is experienced by people who are not labeled as hypertensive.[90] Consequently, population strategies are required to reduce the consequences of high blood pressure and reduce the need for antihypertensive medications. Lifestyle changes are recommended to lower blood pressure.
 Recommended lifestyle changes for the prevention of hypertension include:
 Effective lifestyle modification may lower blood pressure as much as an individual antihypertensive medication. Combinations of two or more lifestyle modifications can achieve even better results.[90] There is considerable evidence that reducing dietary salt intake lowers blood pressure, but whether this translates into a reduction in mortality and cardiovascular disease remains uncertain.[91] Estimated sodium intake ≥6 g/day and <3 g/day are both associated with high risk of death or major cardiovascular disease, but the association between high sodium intake and adverse outcomes is only observed in people with hypertension.[92] Consequently, in the absence of results from randomized controlled trials, the wisdom of reducing levels of dietary salt intake below 3 g/day has been questioned.[91] ESC guidelines mention periodontitis is associated with poor cardiovascular health status.[93]
 The value of routine screening for hypertension is debated.[94][95][96] In 2004, the National High Blood Pressure Education Program recommended that children aged 3 years and older have blood pressure measurement at least once at every health care visit[89] and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and American Academy of Pediatrics made a similar recommendation.[97] However, the American Academy of Family Physicians[98] supports the view of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force that the available evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for hypertension in children and adolescents who do not have symptoms.[99][100] The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening adults 18 years or older for hypertension with office blood pressure measurement.[96][101]
 According to one review published in 2003, reduction of the blood pressure by 5 mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%, of ischemic heart disease by 21%, and reduce the likelihood of dementia, heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular disease.[102]
 Various expert groups have produced guidelines regarding how low the blood pressure target should be when a person is treated for hypertension. These groups recommend a target below the range 140–160 / 90–100 mmHg for the general population.[7][14][103][104] Cochrane reviews recommend similar targets for subgroups such as people with diabetes[105] and people with prior cardiovascular disease.[106] Additionally, Cochrane reviews have found that for older individuals with moderate to high cardiovascular risk, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower than standard blood pressure target (at or below 140/90 mmHg) are outweighed by the risk associated with the intervention.[107] These findings may not be applicable to other populations.[107]
 Many expert groups recommend a slightly higher target of 150/90 mmHg for those over somewhere between 60 and 80 years of age.[103][104][108] The JNC 8 and American College of Physicians recommend the target of 150/90 mmHg for those over 60 years of age,[14][108] but some experts within these groups disagree with this recommendation.[109] Some expert groups have also recommended slightly lower targets in those with diabetes[110] or chronic kidney disease,[111] but others recommend the same target as for the general population.[14][105] The issue of what is the best target and whether targets should differ for high risk individuals is unresolved,[112] although some experts propose more intensive blood pressure lowering than advocated in some guidelines.[113]
 For people who have never experienced cardiovascular disease who are at a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of less than 10%, the 2017 American Heart Association guidelines recommend medications if the systolic blood pressure is >140 mmHg or if the diastolic BP is >90 mmHg.[6] For people who have experienced cardiovascular disease or those who are at a 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease of greater than 10%, it recommends medications if the systolic blood pressure is >130 mmHg or if the diastolic BP is >80 mmHg.[6]
 The first line of treatment for hypertension is lifestyle changes, including dietary changes, physical activity, and weight loss. Though these have all been recommended in scientific advisories,[114] a Cochrane systematic review found no evidence (due to lack of data) for effects of weight loss diets on death, long-term complications or adverse events in persons with hypertension.[115] The review did find a decrease in body weight and blood pressure.[115] Their potential effectiveness is similar to and at times exceeds a single medication.[7] If hypertension is high enough to justify immediate use of medications, lifestyle changes are still recommended in conjunction with medication.
 Dietary changes shown to reduce blood pressure include diets with low sodium,[116][117] the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension),[118] which was the best against 11 other diet in an umbrella review,[119] and plant-based diets.[120] There is some evidence green tea consumption may help lower blood pressure, but this is insufficient for it to be recommended as a treatment.[121] Hibiscus tea consumption may reduce blood pressure.[122][123] Beetroot juice consumption also may lower blood pressure.[124][125][126]
 Increasing dietary potassium has a potential benefit for lowering the risk of hypertension.[127][128] The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) stated that potassium is one of the shortfall nutrients which is under-consumed in the United States.[129] However, people who take certain antihypertensive medications (such as ACE-inhibitors or ARBs) should not take potassium supplements or potassium-enriched salts due to the risk of high levels of potassium.[130]
 Physical exercise regimens which are shown to reduce blood pressure include isometric resistance exercise, aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and device-guided breathing.[131]
 Stress reduction techniques such as biofeedback or transcendental meditation may be considered as an add-on to other treatments to reduce hypertension, but do not have evidence for preventing cardiovascular disease on their own.[131][132][133] Self-monitoring and appointment reminders might support the use of other strategies to improve blood pressure control, but need further evaluation.[134]
 Several classes of medications, collectively referred to as antihypertensive medications, are available for treating hypertension.
 First-line medications for hypertension include thiazide-diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).[135][14] These medications may be used alone or in combination (ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not recommended for use together); the latter option may serve to minimize counter-regulatory mechanisms that act to restore blood pressure values to pre-treatment levels,[14][136] although the evidence for first-line combination therapy is not strong enough.[137] Most people require more than one medication to control their hypertension.[114] Medications for blood pressure control should be implemented by a stepped care approach when target levels are not reached.[134] Withdrawal of such medications in the elderly can be considered by healthcare professionals, because there is no strong evidence of an effect on mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke.[138]
 Previously, beta-blockers such as atenolol were thought to have similar beneficial effects when used as first-line therapy for hypertension. However, a Cochrane review that included 13 trials found that the effects of beta-blockers are inferior to that of other antihypertensive medications in preventing cardiovascular disease.[139]
 The prescription of antihypertensive medication for children with hypertension has limited evidence. There is limited evidence which compare it with placebo and shows modest effect to blood pressure in short term. Administration of higher dose did not make the reduction of blood pressure greater.[140]
 Resistant hypertension is defined as high blood pressure that remains above a target level, in spite of being prescribed three or more antihypertensive drugs simultaneously with different mechanisms of action.[141] Failing to take prescribed medications as directed is an important cause of resistant hypertension.[142]
 Some common secondary causes of resistant hypertension include obstructive sleep apnea, primary aldosteronism and renal artery stenosis, and some rare secondary causes are pheochromocytoma and coarctation of the aorta.[143] As many as one in five people with resistant hypertension have primary aldosteronism, which is a treatable and sometimes curable condition.[144] Resistant hypertension may also result from chronically high activity of the autonomic nervous system, an effect known as neurogenic hypertension.[145] Electrical therapies that stimulate the baroreflex are being studied as an option for lowering blood pressure in people in this situation.[146]
 Refractory hypertension is described by one source as elevated blood pressure unmitigated by five or more concurrent antihypertensive agents of different classes.[147] People with refractory hypertension typically have increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and are at high risk for more severe cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality.[147][148]
 As of 2019[update], one in three or 33% of the world population were estimated to have hypertension.[9][10] Of all people with hypertension, about 46% do not have a diagnosis of hypertension and are unaware that they have the condition.[13][9] In 1975, almost 600 million people had a diagnosis of hypertension, a number which increased to 1.13 billion by 2015 mostly due to risk factors for hypertension increasing in low- and middle-income countries.[13]
 Hypertension is slightly more frequent in men.[10] In people aged under 50 years, more men than women have hypertension,[10] and in ages above 50 years the prevalence of hypertension is the same in men and women.[10] In ages above 65 years, more women than men have hypertension.[7] Hypertension becomes more common with age.[5] Hypertension is common in high, medium, and low-income countries.[13][2] It is more common in people of low socioeconomic status.[151] Hypertension is around twice as common in diabetics.[152]
 In 2019, rates of diagnosed hypertension were highest in Africa (30% for both sexes), and lowest in the Americas (18% for both sexes).[10] Rates also vary markedly within regions with country-level rates as low as 22.8% (men) and 18.4% (women) in Peru and as high as 61.6% (men) and 50.9% (women) in Paraguay.[10]
 In 1995 it was estimated that 24% of the United States population had hypertension or were taking antihypertensive medication.[153] By 2004 this had increased to 29%[154][155] and further to 32% (76 million US adults) by 2017.[6] In 2017, with the American guidelines' change in definition for hypertension, 46% of people in the United States are affected.[6] African-American adults in the United States have among the highest rates of hypertension in the world at 44%.[156] Differences in hypertension rates are multifactorial and under study.[157]
 Rates of high blood pressure in children and adolescents have increased in the last 20 years in the United States.[158] Childhood hypertension, particularly in pre-adolescents, is more often secondary to an underlying disorder than in adults. Kidney disease is the most common secondary cause of hypertension in children and adolescents. Nevertheless, primary or essential hypertension accounts for most cases.[159]
 Hypertension is the most important preventable risk factor for premature death worldwide.[160] It increases the risk of ischemic heart disease,[161] stroke,[25] peripheral vascular disease,[162] and other cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, aortic aneurysms, diffuse atherosclerosis, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, cancers, leukemia and pulmonary embolism.[12][25] Hypertension is also a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia.[25] Other complications include hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive nephropathy.[30]
 Modern understanding of the cardiovascular system began with the work of physician William Harvey (1578–1657), who described the circulation of blood in his book ""De motu cordis"". The English clergyman Stephen Hales made the first published measurement of blood pressure in 1733.[163][164] However, hypertension as a clinical entity came into its own with the invention of the cuff-based sphygmomanometer by Scipione Riva-Rocci in 1896.[165] This allowed easy measurement of systolic pressure in the clinic. In 1905, Nikolai Korotkoff improved the technique by describing the Korotkoff sounds that are heard when the artery is ausculted with a stethoscope while the sphygmomanometer cuff is deflated.[164] This permitted systolic and diastolic pressure to be measured.
 The symptoms similar to symptoms of patients with hypertensive crisis are discussed in medieval Persian medical texts in the chapter of ""fullness disease"".[166] The symptoms include headache, heaviness in the head, sluggish movements, general redness and warm to touch feel of the body, prominent, distended and tense vessels, fullness of the pulse, distension of the skin, coloured and dense urine, loss of appetite, weak eyesight, impairment of thinking, yawning, drowsiness, vascular rupture, and hemorrhagic stroke.[167] Fullness disease was presumed to be due to an excessive amount of blood within the blood vessels.
 Descriptions of hypertension as a disease came among others from Thomas Young in 1808 and especially Richard Bright in 1836.[163] The first report of elevated blood pressure in a person without evidence of kidney disease was made by Frederick Akbar Mahomed (1849–1884).[168]
 Until the 1990s, systolic hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or greater.[169] In 1993, the WHO/ISH guidelines defined 140 mmHg as the threshold for hypertension.[170]
 Historically the treatment for what was called the ""hard pulse disease"" consisted in reducing the quantity of blood by bloodletting or the application of leeches.[163] This was advocated by The Yellow Emperor of China, Cornelius Celsus, Galen, and Hippocrates.[163] The therapeutic approach for the treatment of hard pulse disease included changes in lifestyle (staying away from anger and sexual intercourse) and dietary program for patients (avoiding the consumption of wine, meat, and pastries, reducing the volume of food in a meal, maintaining a low-energy diet and the dietary usage of spinach and vinegar).
 In the 19th and 20th centuries, before effective pharmacological treatment for hypertension became possible, three treatment modalities were used, all with numerous side-effects: strict sodium restriction (for example the rice diet[163]), sympathectomy (surgical ablation of parts of the sympathetic nervous system), and pyrogen therapy (injection of substances that caused a fever, indirectly reducing blood pressure).[163][171]
 The first chemical for hypertension, sodium thiocyanate, was used in 1900 but had many side effects and was unpopular.[163] Several other agents were developed after the Second World War, the most popular and reasonably effective of which were tetramethylammonium chloride, hexamethonium, hydralazine, and reserpine (derived from the medicinal plant Rauvolfia serpentina). None of these were well tolerated.[172][173] A major breakthrough was achieved with the discovery of the first well-tolerated orally available agents. The first was chlorothiazide, the first thiazide diuretic and developed from the antibiotic sulfanilamide, which became available in 1958.[163][174] Subsequently, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and renin inhibitors were developed as antihypertensive agents.[171]
 The World Health Organization has identified hypertension (high blood pressure) as the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality.[175] The World Hypertension League (WHL), an umbrella organization of 85 national hypertension societies and leagues, recognized that more than 50% of the hypertensive population worldwide are unaware of their condition.[175] To address this problem, the WHL initiated a global awareness campaign on hypertension in 2005 and dedicated 17 May of each year as World Hypertension Day.[176]
 High blood pressure is the most common chronic medical problem prompting visits to primary health care providers in US. The American Heart Association estimated the direct and indirect costs of high blood pressure in 2010 as $76.6 billion.[156] In the US 80% of people with hypertension are aware of their condition, 71% take some antihypertensive medication, but only 48% of people aware that they have hypertension adequately control it.[156] Adequate management of hypertension can be hampered by inadequacies in the diagnosis, treatment, or control of high blood pressure.[177] Health care providers face many obstacles to achieving blood pressure control, including resistance to taking multiple medications to reach blood pressure goals. People also face the challenges of adhering to medicine schedules and making lifestyle changes. Nonetheless, the achievement of blood pressure goals is possible, and most importantly, lowering blood pressure significantly reduces the risk of death due to heart disease and stroke, the development of other debilitating conditions, and the cost associated with advanced medical care.[178][179]
 Hypertension in cats is indicated with a systolic blood pressure greater than 150 mmHg, with amlodipine the usual first-line treatment. A cat with a systolic blood pressure above 170 mmHg is considered hypertensive. If a cat has other problems such as any kidney disease or retina detachment then a blood pressure below 160 mmHg may also need to be monitored.[180]
 Normal blood pressure in dogs can differ substantially between breeds but hypertension is often diagnosed if systolic blood pressure is above 160 mmHg particularly if this is associated with target organ damage.[181] Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and calcium channel blockers are often used to treat hypertension in dogs, although other drugs may be indicated for specific conditions causing high blood pressure.[181]

"The flu is a common respiratory illness you get from the influenza virus. Symptoms often include fever, head and body aches, coughing and a stuffy or runny nose. You’re at risk for serious complications if you have an underlying health condition or are pregnant. Getting vaccinated every year is the best way to avoid getting sick with the flu. The flu is an illness you get from the influenza virus. It causes symptoms like head and body aches, sore throat, fever and respiratory symptoms, which can be severe. Flu is most common in winter months, when many people can get sick at once (an epidemic). Flu season — when cases of the flu go up dramatically — in the Northern Hemisphere (which includes the U.S.) is October through May. The highest number of cases (peak) usually happen between December and February. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy The flu is one of the most common infectious diseases. Every flu season, about 20 to 40 million people in the U.S. catch the flu. The flu and the common cold can have similar symptoms, like runny nose and cough. But cold symptoms are usually mild and flu symptoms can be severe and lead to serious complications. Different viruses cause colds and the flu. Advertisement Since they have similar symptoms, the only way to know for sure if you have the flu or COVID-19 is to get tested. They both have a risk of serious illness. But different viruses cause these infections, and providers treat them with different medications. Certain health conditions can put you at higher risk for severe illness from the flu. This includes life-threatening complications that require hospitalization. You’re at higher risk for serious illness if you: Non-Hispanic Black people, non-Hispanic American Indians, Alaska Native people and Hispanic or Latino people have the highest rates of severe illness from the flu compared to non-Hispanic White people and non-Hispanic Asian people. Advertisement Symptoms of the flu usually come on quickly, and can include: You may not have all of these symptoms. The influenza virus causes flu. Influenza A, B and C are the most common types that infect people. Influenza A and B are seasonal (most people get them in the winter) and have more severe symptoms. Influenza C doesn’t cause severe symptoms and it’s not seasonal — the number of cases stays about the same throughout the year. H1N1 (“swine flu”) and bird flu are both subtypes of influenza A. Yes, the flu is contagious (it spreads from person to person). For every person infected, they spread the flu to one to two more people. The influenza virus spreads from direct or indirect contact with someone else who’s infected. Common ways to get the flu include: If infected, you’ll usually get symptoms of the flu one to four days after exposure (incubation period). Your provider diagnoses the flu by listening to your symptoms and testing a sample of mucus from your nose. They’ll put a long stick with a soft tip (swab) in your nose to test for influenza. Results may take a few minutes or your provider may send the sample to a lab, where you’ll get results in a day or two. Providers can treat the flu with antiviral medications under certain circumstances. Antivirals can reduce your risk of severe illness and shorten the amount of time you’re sick. Many people can treat the flu without prescription medications. Providers prescribe antivirals if you: Antiviral drugs for influenza include: Tell your provider about any health conditions you have before starting an antiviral medication. Each antiviral medication has different side effects, but common ones include nausea and diarrhea. Inhaled medications can cause spasms that tighten and narrow your airways (bronchospasm). Many people can manage the symptoms of flu at home with over-the-counter (OTC) medications and other therapies, including: Not everyone should take certain OTCs, so check with your provider before you use them. It’s also a good idea to make sure certain medications are okay to use together or with supplements. Don’t give aspirin to children under the age of 16 unless their provider says it’s okay. The best way to prevent the flu is to get the flu vaccine every year. Vaccines train your immune system to recognize infections and fight them off before you get sick. The influenza virus can change (mutate) a little bit every year, which is why you need to get vaccinated every year. Even if you get sick with a different version of the flu than the one in the vaccine, vaccination reduces your risk of getting seriously ill. Your provider can give you the flu vaccine as a shot or as a mist they spray into your nose. Other ways to reduce your risk of getting the flu include: Most people are able to manage flu symptoms at home and recover within a few days to a week. Because it can cause severe illness, it’s important to keep an eye on your symptoms and get medical attention if you need it. This is especially important if you have an underlying health condition. If you’re sick with the flu, you should avoid being around others, except to seek medical care. Flu can last from a few days to two weeks. Symptoms like fever and body aches can come on suddenly but usually go away faster than other symptoms. A cough or runny nose can last longer. You can be contagious with the flu from a day before your symptoms start to up to a week after. You’re most contagious for three to four days after your symptoms start. People with weakened immune systems and infants may be contagious for longer. To avoid spreading the flu to others, you shouldn’t go back to work or school until it’s been at least 24 hours since you’ve had a fever (without taking fever-reducing medications). Your employer or school may have different requirements for returning. The flu virus itself can cause complications or it can weaken your immune system and allow bacteria to infect different parts of your body (secondary infection). Complications and secondary infections include: In a typical flu season in the U.S., it’s estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 people die from the flu. Another 300,000 to 500,000 require hospitalization for serious illness. If you think you have the flu, it’s important to get tested early on so that antiviral medications are most effective if your provider prescribes them. Contact a healthcare provider right away if: Go to the ER or seek immediate medical attention if you have symptoms of severe illness, including: No, gastroenteritis, commonly called “stomach flu,” isn’t caused by the influenza virus. It’s not related to the seasonal flu. A note from Cleveland Clinic While the flu is very common, it’s also important to remember that it can lead to life-threatening complications. Getting your flu shot is the best way to avoid getting sick and protect your loved ones and neighbors, too. If you have underlying health conditions or are pregnant, talk to your provider about reducing your risk of flu. Having the flu isn’t fun for anyone, but most people can get through with some movies and chicken soup at home. Last reviewed on 10/11/2022. Learn more about our editorial process.

 Influenza, commonly known as ""the flu"" or just ""flu"", is an infectious disease caused by influenza viruses. Symptoms range from mild to severe and often include fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pain, headache, coughing, and fatigue. These symptoms begin one to four (typically two) days after exposure to the virus and last for about two to eight days. Diarrhea and vomiting can occur, particularly in children. Influenza may progress to pneumonia from the virus or a subsequent bacterial infection. Other complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, and worsening of pre-existing health problems such as asthma and cardiovascular disease.
 There are four types of influenza virus: types A, B, C, and D. Aquatic birds are the primary source of influenza A virus (IAV), which is also widespread in various mammals, including humans and pigs. Influenza B virus (IBV) and influenza C virus (ICV) primarily infect humans, and influenza D virus (IDV) is found in cattle and pigs. Influenza A virus and influenza B virus circulate in humans and cause seasonal epidemics, and influenza C virus causes a mild infection, primarily in children. Influenza D virus can infect humans but is not known to cause illness. In humans, influenza viruses are primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing. Transmission through aerosols and surfaces contaminated by the virus also occur.
 Frequent hand washing and covering one's mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing reduce transmission. Annual vaccination can help to provide protection against influenza. Influenza viruses, particularly influenza A virus, evolve quickly, so flu vaccines are updated regularly to match which influenza strains are in circulation. Vaccines provide protection against influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and one or two influenza B virus subtypes. Influenza infection is diagnosed with laboratory methods such as antibody or antigen tests and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify viral nucleic acid. The disease can be treated with supportive measures and, in severe cases, with antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir. In healthy individuals, influenza is typically self-limiting and rarely fatal, but it can be deadly in high-risk groups.
 In a typical year, five to 15 percent of the population contracts influenza. There are 3 to 5 million severe cases annually, with up to 650,000 respiratory-related deaths globally each year. Deaths most commonly occur in high-risk groups, including young children, the elderly, and people with chronic health conditions. In temperate regions, the number of influenza cases peaks during winter, whereas in the tropics, influenza can occur year-round. Since the late 1800s, pandemic outbreaks of novel influenza strains have occurred every 10 to 50 years. Five flu pandemics have occurred since 1900: the Spanish flu from 1918 to 1920, which was the most severe; the Asian flu in 1957; the Hong Kong flu in 1968; the Russian flu in 1977; and the swine flu pandemic in 2009.
 The symptoms of influenza are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose.[8][9] The time between exposure to the virus and development of symptoms (the incubation period) is one to four days, most commonly one to two days. Many infections are asymptomatic.[10] The onset of symptoms is sudden, and initial symptoms are predominately non-specific, including fever, chills, headaches, muscle pain, malaise, loss of appetite, lack of energy, and confusion. These are usually accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as a dry cough, sore or dry throat, hoarse voice, and a stuffy or runny nose. Coughing is the most common symptom.[1] Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,[11] and gastroenteritis,[12] especially in children. The standard influenza symptoms typically last for two to eight days.[13] Some studies suggest influenza can cause long-lasting symptoms in a similar way to long COVID.[14][15][16]
 Symptomatic infections are usually mild and limited to the upper respiratory tract, but progression to pneumonia is relatively common. Pneumonia may be caused by the primary viral infection or a secondary bacterial infection. Primary pneumonia is characterized by rapid progression of fever, cough, labored breathing, and low oxygen levels that cause bluish skin. It is especially common among those who have an underlying cardiovascular disease such as rheumatic heart disease. Secondary pneumonia typically has a period of improvement in symptoms for one to three weeks[17] followed by recurrent fever, sputum production, and fluid buildup in the lungs,[1] but can also occur just a few days after influenza symptoms appear.[17] About a third of primary pneumonia cases are followed by secondary pneumonia, which is most frequently caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus.[10][1]
 Influenza viruses comprise four species, each the sole member of its own genus. The four influenza genera comprise four of the seven genera in the family Orthomyxoviridae. They are:[1][18]
 Influenza A virus is responsible for most cases of severe illness as well as seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. It infects people of all ages but tends to disproportionately cause severe illness in the elderly, the very young, and those with chronic health issues. Birds are the primary reservoir of influenza A virus, especially aquatic birds such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and gulls,[19][20] but the virus also circulates among mammals, including pigs, horses, and marine mammals.
 Subtypes of Influenza A are defined by the combination of the antigenic viral proteins haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) in the viral envelope; for example, ""H1N1"" designates an IAV subtype that has a type-1 hemagglutinin (H) protein and a type-1 neuraminidase (N) protein.[21] Almost all possible combinations of H (1 thru 16) and N (1 thru 11) have been isolated from wild birds.[22][23] In addition H17, H18, N10 and N11 have been found in bats.[24][23] The influenza A virus subtypes in circulation among humans as of 2018[update] are H1N1 and H3N2.[2]
 Influenza B virus mainly infects humans but has been identified in seals, horses, dogs, and pigs.[23] Influenza B virus does not have subtypes like influenza A virus but has two antigenically distinct lineages, termed the B/Victoria/2/1987-like and B/Yamagata/16/1988-like lineages,[1] or simply (B/)Victoria(-like) and (B/)Yamagata(-like).[23][2] Both lineages are in circulation in humans,[1] disproportionately affecting children.[11] However, the B/Yamagata lineage might have become extinct in 2020/2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic measures.[25] Influenza B viruses contribute to seasonal epidemics alongside influenza A viruses but have never been associated with a pandemic.[23]
 Influenza C virus, like influenza B virus, is primarily found in humans, though it has been detected in pigs, feral dogs, dromedary camels, cattle, and dogs.[12][23] Influenza C virus infection primarily affects children and is usually asymptomatic[1][11] or has mild cold-like symptoms, though more severe symptoms such as gastroenteritis and pneumonia can occur.[12] Unlike influenza A virus and influenza B virus, influenza C virus has not been a major focus of research pertaining to antiviral drugs, vaccines, and other measures against influenza.[23] Influenza C virus is subclassified into six genetic/antigenic lineages.[12][26]
 Influenza D virus has been isolated from pigs and cattle, the latter being the natural reservoir. Infection has also been observed in humans, horses, dromedary camels, and small ruminants such as goats and sheep.[23][26] Influenza D virus is distantly related to influenza C virus. While cattle workers have occasionally tested positive to prior influenza D virus infection, it is not known to cause disease in humans.[1][11][12] Influenza C virus and influenza D virus experience a slower rate of antigenic evolution than influenza A virus and influenza B virus. Because of this antigenic stability, relatively few novel lineages emerge.[26]
 Every year, millions of influenza virus samples are analysed to monitor changes in the virus' antigenic properties, and to inform the development of vaccines.[27]
 To unambiguously describe a specific isolate of virus, researchers use the internationally accepted influenza virus nomenclature,i[28] which describes, among other things, the species of animal from which the virus was isolated, and the place and year of collection. As an example - A/chicken/Nakorn-Patom/Thailand/CU-K2/04(H5N1):
 The nomenclature for influenza B, C and D, which are less variable, is simpler. Examples are B/Santiago/29615/2020 and C/Minnesota/10/2015.[29]
 Influenza viruses have a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that is segmented. The negative sense of the genome means it can be used as a template to synthesize messenger RNA (mRNA).[10] Influenza A virus and influenza B virus have eight genome segments that encode 10 major proteins. Influenza C virus and influenza D virus have seven genome segments that encode nine major proteins.[12] Three segments encode three subunits of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex: PB1, a transcriptase, PB2, which recognizes 5' caps, and PA (P3 for influenza C virus and influenza D virus), an endonuclease.[30] The matrix protein (M1) and membrane protein (M2) share a segment, as do the non-structural protein (NS1) and the nuclear export protein (NEP).[1] For influenza A virus and influenza B virus, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are encoded on one segment each, whereas influenza C virus and influenza D virus encode a hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) protein on one segment that merges the functions of HA and NA. The final genome segment encodes the viral nucleoprotein (NP).[30] Influenza viruses also encode various accessory proteins, such as PB1-F2 and PA-X, that are expressed through alternative open reading frames[1][31] and which are important in host defense suppression, virulence, and pathogenicity.[32]
 The virus particle, called a virion, is pleomorphic and varies between being filamentous, bacilliform, or spherical in shape. Clinical isolates tend to be pleomorphic, whereas strains adapted to laboratory growth typically produce spherical virions. Filamentous virions are about 250 nanometers (nm) by 80 nm, bacilliform 120–250 by 95 nm, and spherical 120 nm in diameter.[33] The virion consists of each segment of the genome bound to nucleoproteins in separate ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes for each segment, all of which are surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane called the viral envelope. There is a copy of the RdRp, all subunits included, bound to each RNP. The envelope is reinforced structurally by matrix proteins on the interior that enclose the RNPs,[3] and the envelope contains HA and NA (or HEF[26]) proteins extending outward from the exterior surface of the envelope. HA and HEF[26] proteins have a distinct ""head"" and ""stalk"" structure. M2 proteins form proton ion channels through the viral envelope that are required for viral entry and exit. Influenza B viruses contain a surface protein named NB that is anchored in the envelope, but its function is unknown.[1]
 The viral life cycle begins by binding to a target cell. Binding is mediated by the viral HA proteins on the surface of the envelope, which bind to cells that contain sialic acid receptors on the surface of the cell membrane.[1][19][3] For N1 subtypes with the ""G147R"" mutation and N2 subtypes, the NA protein can initiate entry. Prior to binding, NA proteins promote access to target cells by degrading mucus, which helps to remove extracellular decoy receptors that would impede access to target cells.[3] After binding, the virus is internalized into the cell by an endosome that contains the virion inside it. The endosome is acidified by cellular vATPase[31] to have lower pH, which triggers a conformational change in HA that allows fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane.[32] At the same time, hydrogen ions diffuse into the virion through M2 ion channels, disrupting internal protein-protein interactions to release RNPs into the host cell's cytosol. The M1 protein shell surrounding RNPs is degraded, fully uncoating RNPs in the cytosol.[31][3]
 RNPs are then imported into the nucleus with the help of viral localization signals. There, the viral RNA polymerase transcribes mRNA using the genomic negative-sense strand as a template. The polymerase snatches 5' caps for viral mRNA from cellular RNA to prime mRNA synthesis and the 3'-end of mRNA is polyadenylated at the end of transcription.[30] Once viral mRNA is transcribed, it is exported out of the nucleus and translated by host ribosomes in a cap-dependent manner to synthesize viral proteins.[31] RdRp also synthesizes complementary positive-sense strands of the viral genome in a complementary RNP complex which are then used as templates by viral polymerases to synthesize copies of the negative-sense genome.[1][3] During these processes, RdRps of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) function optimally at a higher temperature than mammalian influenza viruses.[13]
 Newly synthesized viral polymerase subunits and NP proteins are imported to the nucleus to further increase the rate of viral replication and form RNPs.[30] HA, NA, and M2 proteins are trafficked with the aid of M1 and NEP proteins[32] to the cell membrane through the Golgi apparatus[30] and inserted into the cell's membrane. Viral non-structural proteins including NS1, PB1-F2, and PA-X regulate host cellular processes to disable antiviral responses.[1][32][3] PB1-F2 also interacts with PB1 to keep polymerases in the nucleus longer.[20] M1 and NEP proteins localize to the nucleus during the later stages of infection, bind to viral RNPs and mediate their export to the cytoplasm where they migrate to the cell membrane with the aid of recycled endosomes and are bundled into the segments of the genome.[1][3]
 Progeny viruses leave the cell by budding from the cell membrane, which is initiated by the accumulation of M1 proteins at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The viral genome is incorporated inside a viral envelope derived from portions of the cell membrane that have HA, NA, and M2 proteins. At the end of budding, HA proteins remain attached to cellular sialic acid until they are cleaved by the sialidase activity of NA proteins. The virion is then released from the cell. The sialidase activity of NA also cleaves any sialic acid residues from the viral surface, which helps prevent newly assembled viruses from aggregating near the cell surface and improving infectivity.[1][3] Similar to other aspects of influenza replication, optimal NA activity is temperature- and pH-dependent.[13] Ultimately, presence of large quantities of viral RNA in the cell triggers apoptosis (programmed cell death), which is initiated by cellular factors to restrict viral replication.[31]
 Two key processes that influenza viruses evolve through are antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Antigenic drift is when an influenza virus' antigens change due to the gradual accumulation of mutations in the antigen's (HA or NA) gene.[19] This can occur in response to evolutionary pressure exerted by the host immune response. Antigenic drift is especially common for the HA protein, in which just a few amino acid changes in the head region can constitute antigenic drift.[2][26] The result is the production of novel strains that can evade pre-existing antibody-mediated immunity.[1][11] Antigenic drift occurs in all influenza species but is slower in B than A and slowest in C and D.[26] Antigenic drift is a major cause of seasonal influenza,[34] and requires that flu vaccines be updated annually. HA is the main component of inactivated vaccines, so surveillance monitors antigenic drift of this antigen among circulating strains. Antigenic evolution of influenza viruses of humans appears to be faster than in swine and equines. In wild birds, within-subtype antigenic variation appears to be limited but has been observed in poultry.[1][11]
 Antigenic shift is a sudden, drastic change in an influenza virus' antigen, usually HA. During antigenic shift, antigenically different strains that infect the same cell can reassort genome segments with each other, producing hybrid progeny. Since all influenza viruses have segmented genomes, all are capable of reassortment.[12][26] Antigenic shift only occurs among influenza viruses of the same genus[30] and most commonly occurs among influenza A viruses. In particular, reassortment is very common in AIVs, creating a large diversity of influenza viruses in birds, but is uncommon in human, equine, and canine lineages.[35] Pigs, bats, and quails have receptors for both mammalian and avian influenza A viruses, so they are potential ""mixing vessels"" for reassortment.[23] If an animal strain reassorts with a human strain,[2] then a novel strain can emerge that is capable of human-to-human transmission. This has caused pandemics, but only a limited number, so it is difficult to predict when the next will happen.[1][11]
The Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System of the World Health Organization (GISRS) tests several millions of specimens annually to monitor the spread and evolution of influenza viruses.[36][37][38]
 People who are infected can transmit influenza viruses through breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing, which spread respiratory droplets and aerosols that contain virus particles into the air. A person susceptible to infection can contract influenza by coming into contact with these particles.[17][39] Respiratory droplets are relatively large and travel less than two meters before falling onto nearby surfaces. Aerosols are smaller and remain suspended in the air longer, so they take longer to settle and can travel further.[39][4] Inhalation of aerosols can lead to infection,[40] but most transmission is in the area about two meters around an infected person via respiratory droplets[10] that come into contact with mucosa of the upper respiratory tract.[40] Transmission through contact with a person, bodily fluids, or intermediate objects (fomites) can also occur,[10][39] since influenza viruses can survive for hours on non-porous surfaces.[4] If one's hands are contaminated, then touching one's face can cause infection.[41]
 Influenza is usually transmissible from one day before the onset of symptoms to 5–7 days after.[11] In healthy adults, the virus is shed for up to 3–5 days. In children and the immunocompromised, the virus may be transmissible for several weeks.[10] Children ages 2–17 are considered to be the primary and most efficient spreaders of influenza.[1][11] Children who have not had multiple prior exposures to influenza viruses shed the virus at greater quantities and for a longer duration than other children.[1] People at risk of exposure to influenza include health care workers, social care workers, and those who live with or care for people vulnerable to influenza. In long-term care facilities, the flu can spread rapidly.[11] A variety of factors likely encourage influenza transmission, including lower temperature, lower absolute and relative humidity, less ultraviolet radiation from the sun,[40][42] and crowding.[39] Influenza viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract like H1N1 tend to be more mild but more transmissible, whereas those that infect the lower respiratory tract like H5N1 tend to cause more severe illness but are less contagious.[10]
 In humans, influenza viruses first cause infection by infecting epithelial cells in the respiratory tract. Illness during infection is primarily the result of lung inflammation and compromise caused by epithelial cell infection and death, combined with inflammation caused by the immune system's response to infection. Non-respiratory organs can become involved, but the mechanisms by which influenza is involved in these cases are unknown. Severe respiratory illness can be caused by multiple, non-exclusive mechanisms, including obstruction of the airways, loss of alveolar structure, loss of lung epithelial integrity due to epithelial cell infection and death, and degradation of the extracellular matrix that maintains lung structure. In particular, alveolar cell infection appears to drive severe symptoms since this results in impaired gas exchange and enables viruses to infect endothelial cells, which produce large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines.[17]
 Pneumonia caused by influenza viruses is characterized by high levels of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, accompanied by a strong pro-inflammatory response called a cytokine storm.[1] Infection with H5N1 or H7N9 especially produces high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.[19] In bacterial infections, early depletion of macrophages during influenza creates a favorable environment in the lungs for bacterial growth since these white blood cells are important in responding to bacterial infection. Host mechanisms to encourage tissue repair may inadvertently allow bacterial infection. Infection also induces production of systemic glucocorticoids that can reduce inflammation to preserve tissue integrity but allow increased bacterial growth.[17]
 The pathophysiology of influenza is significantly influenced by which receptors influenza viruses bind to during entry into cells. Mammalian influenza viruses preferentially bind to sialic acids connected to the rest of the oligosaccharide by an α-2,6 link, most commonly found in various respiratory cells,[1][19][3] such as respiratory and retinal epithelial cells.[31] AIVs prefer sialic acids with an α-2,3 linkage, which are most common in birds in gastrointestinal epithelial cells[1][19][3] and in humans in the lower respiratory tract.[44] Cleavage of the HA protein into HA1, the binding subunit, and HA2, the fusion subunit, is performed by different proteases, affecting which cells can be infected. For mammalian influenza viruses and low pathogenic AIVs, cleavage is extracellular, which limits infection to cells that have the appropriate proteases, whereas for highly pathogenic AIVs, cleavage is intracellular and performed by ubiquitous proteases, which allows for infection of a greater variety of cells, thereby contributing to more severe disease.[1][35][45]
 Cells possess sensors to detect viral RNA, which can then induce interferon production. Interferons mediate expression of antiviral proteins and proteins that recruit immune cells to the infection site, and they notify nearby uninfected cells of infection. Some infected cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines that recruit immune cells to the site of infection. Immune cells control viral infection by killing infected cells and phagocytizing viral particles and apoptotic cells. An exacerbated immune response can harm the host organism through a cytokine storm.[1][13][31] To counter the immune response, influenza viruses encode various non-structural proteins, including NS1, NEP, PB1-F2, and PA-X, that are involved in curtailing the host immune response by suppressing interferon production and host gene expression.[1][32]
 B cells, a type of white blood cell, produce antibodies that bind to influenza antigens HA and NA (or HEF[26]) and other proteins to a lesser degree. Once bound to these proteins, antibodies block virions from binding to cellular receptors, neutralizing the virus. In humans, a sizeable antibody response occurs about one week after viral exposure.[46] This antibody response is typically robust and long-lasting, especially for influenza C virus and influenza D virus.[1][26] People exposed to a certain strain in childhood still possess antibodies to that strain at a reasonable level later in life, which can provide some protection to related strains.[1] There is, however, an ""original antigenic sin"", in which the first HA subtype a person is exposed to influences the antibody-based immune response to future infections and vaccines.[2]
 Annual vaccination is the primary and most effective way to prevent influenza and influenza-associated complications, especially for high-risk groups.[10][1][47] Vaccines against the flu are trivalent or quadrivalent, providing protection against an H1N1 strain, an H3N2 strain, and one or two influenza B virus strains corresponding to the two influenza B virus lineages.[10][2] Two types of vaccines are in use: inactivated vaccines that contain ""killed"" (i.e. inactivated) viruses and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) that contain weakened viruses.[1] There are three types of inactivated vaccines: whole virus, split virus, in which the virus is disrupted by a detergent, and subunit, which only contains the viral antigens HA and NA.[48] Most flu vaccines are inactivated and administered via intramuscular injection. LAIVs are sprayed into the nasal cavity.[1]
 Vaccination recommendations vary by country. Some recommend vaccination for all people above a certain age, such as 6 months,[47] whereas other countries limit recommendations to high-risk groups.[1][11] Young infants cannot receive flu vaccines for safety reasons, but they can inherit passive immunity from their mother if vaccinated during pregnancy.[49] Influenza vaccination helps to reduce the probability of reassortment.[13]
 In general, influenza vaccines are only effective if there is an antigenic match between vaccine strains and circulating strains.[10][2] Most commercially available flu vaccines are manufactured by propagation of influenza viruses in embryonated chicken eggs, taking 6–8 months.[2] Flu seasons are different in the northern and southern hemisphere, so the WHO meets twice a year, once for each hemisphere, to discuss which strains should be included based on observation from HA inhibition assays.[10][3] Other manufacturing methods include an MDCK cell culture-based inactivated vaccine and a recombinant subunit vaccine manufactured from baculovirus overexpression in insect cells.[2][50]
 Influenza can be prevented or reduced in severity by post-exposure prophylaxis with the antiviral drugs oseltamivir, which can be taken orally by those at least three months old, and zanamivir, which can be inhaled by those above seven years. Chemoprophylaxis is most useful for individuals at high risk for complications and those who cannot receive the flu vaccine.[10] Post-exposure chemoprophylaxis is only recommended if oseltamivir is taken within 48 hours of contact with a confirmed or suspected case and zanamivir within 36 hours.[10][11] It is recommended for people who have yet to receive a vaccine for the current flu season, who have been vaccinated less than two week since contact, if there is a significant mismatch between vaccine and circulating strains, or during an outbreak in a closed setting regardless of vaccination history.[11]
 Hand hygiene is important in reducing the spread of influenza. This includes frequent hand washing with soap and water, using alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and not touching one's eyes, nose, and mouth with one's hands. Covering one's nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing is important.[51] Other methods to limit influenza transmission include staying home when sick,[1] avoiding contact with others until one day after symptoms end,[11] and disinfecting surfaces likely to be contaminated by the virus.[1]
 Research thus far has not shown a significant reduction in seasonal influenza with mask usage. The effectiveness of screening at points of entry into countries is not well researched.[51] Social distancing measures such as school closures, isolation or quarantine, and limiting mass gatherings may reduce transmission,[1][51] but these measures are often expensive, unpopular, and difficult to implement. Consequently, the commonly recommended methods of infection control are respiratory etiquette, hand hygiene, and mask wearing, which are inexpensive and easy. Pharmaceutical measures are effective but may not be available in the early stages of an outbreak.[52]
 In health care settings, infected individuals may be cohorted or assigned to individual rooms. Protective clothing such as masks, gloves, and gowns is recommended when coming into contact with infected individuals if there is a risk of exposure to infected bodily fluids. Keeping patients in negative pressure rooms and avoiding aerosol-producing activities may help,[10] but special air handling and ventilation systems are not considered necessary to prevent the spread of influenza in the air.[4] In residential homes, new admissions may need to be closed until the spread of influenza is controlled.[11]
 Since influenza viruses circulate in animals such as birds and pigs, prevention of transmission from these animals is important. Water treatment, indoor raising of animals, quarantining sick animals, vaccination, and biosecurity are the primary measures used. Placing poultry houses and piggeries on high ground away from high-density farms, backyard farms, live poultry markets, and bodies of water helps to minimize contact with wild birds.[1] Closure of live poultry markets appears to the most effective measure[19] and has shown to be effective at controlling the spread of H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2.[20] Other biosecurity measures include cleaning and disinfecting facilities and vehicles, banning visits to poultry farms, not bringing birds intended for slaughter back to farms,[53] changing clothes, disinfecting foot baths, and treating food and water.[1]
 If live poultry markets are not closed, then ""clean days"" when unsold poultry is removed and facilities are disinfected and ""no carry-over"" policies to eliminate infectious material before new poultry arrive can be used to reduce the spread of influenza viruses. If a novel influenza viruses has breached the aforementioned biosecurity measures, then rapid detection to stamp it out via quarantining, decontamination, and culling may be necessary to prevent the virus from becoming endemic.[1] Vaccines exist for avian H5, H7, and H9 subtypes that are used in some countries.[19] In China, for example, vaccination of domestic birds against H7N9 successfully limited its spread, indicating that vaccination may be an effective strategy[35] if used in combination with other measures to limit transmission.[1] In pigs and horses, management of influenza is dependent on vaccination with biosecurity.[1]
 Diagnosis based on symptoms is fairly accurate in otherwise healthy people during seasonal epidemics and should be suspected in cases of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, or if encephalitis, myocarditis, or breakdown of muscle tissue occur.[17] Because influenza is similar to other viral respiratory tract illnesses, laboratory diagnosis is necessary for confirmation. Common sample collection methods for testing include nasal and throat swabs.[1] Samples may be taken from the lower respiratory tract if infection has cleared the upper but not lower respiratory tract. Influenza testing is recommended for anyone hospitalized with symptoms resembling influenza during flu season or who is connected to an influenza case. For severe cases, earlier diagnosis improves patient outcome.[47] Diagnostic methods that can identify influenza include viral cultures, antibody- and antigen-detecting tests, and nucleic acid-based tests.[54]
 Viruses can be grown in a culture of mammalian cells or embryonated eggs for 3–10 days to monitor cytopathic effect. Final confirmation can then be done via antibody staining, hemadsorption using red blood cells, or immunofluorescence microscopy. Shell vial cultures, which can identify infection via immunostaining before a cytopathic effect appears, are more sensitive than traditional cultures with results in 1–3 days.[1][47][54] Cultures can be used to characterize novel viruses, observe sensitivity to antiviral drugs, and monitor antigenic drift, but they are relatively slow and require specialized skills and equipment.[1]
 Serological assays can be used to detect an antibody response to influenza after natural infection or vaccination. Common serological assays include hemagglutination inhibition assays that detect HA-specific antibodies, virus neutralization assays that check whether antibodies have neutralized the virus, and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assays. These methods tend to be relatively inexpensive and fast but are less reliable than nucleic-acid based tests.[1][54]
 Direct fluorescent or immunofluorescent antibody (DFA/IFA) tests involve staining respiratory epithelial cells in samples with fluorescently-labeled influenza-specific antibodies, followed by examination under a fluorescent microscope. They can differentiate between influenza A virus and influenza B virus but can not subtype influenza A virus.[54] Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) are a simple way of obtaining assay results, are low cost, and produce results in less than 30 minutes, so they are commonly used, but they can not distinguish between influenza A virus and influenza B virus or between influenza A virus subtypes and are not as sensitive as nucleic-acid based tests.[1][54]
 Nucleic acid-based tests (NATs) amplify and detect viral nucleic acid. Most of these tests take a few hours,[54] but rapid molecular assays are as fast as RIDTs.[47] Among NATs, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most traditional and considered the gold standard for diagnosing influenza[54] because it is fast and can subtype influenza A virus, but it is relatively expensive and more prone to false-positives than cultures.[1] Other NATs that have been used include loop-mediated isothermal amplification-based assays, simple amplification-based assays, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. Nucleic acid sequencing methods can identify infection by obtaining the nucleic acid sequence of viral samples to identify the virus and antiviral drug resistance. The traditional method is Sanger sequencing, but it has been largely replaced by next-generation methods that have greater sequencing speed and throughput.[54]
 Treatment in cases of mild or moderate illness is supportive and includes anti-fever medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen,[55] adequate fluid intake to avoid dehydration, and rest.[11] Cough drops and throat sprays may be beneficial for sore throat. It is recommended to avoid alcohol and tobacco use while ill.[55] Aspirin is not recommended to treat influenza in children due to an elevated risk of developing Reye syndrome.[56] Corticosteroids are not recommended except when treating septic shock or an underlying medical condition, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma exacerbation, since they are associated with increased mortality.[47] If a secondary bacterial infection occurs, then antibiotics may be necessary.[11]
 Antiviral drugs are primarily used to treat severely ill patients, especially those with compromised immune systems. Antivirals are most effective when started in the first 48 hours after symptoms appear. Later administration may still be beneficial for those who have underlying immune defects, those with more severe symptoms, or those who have a higher risk of developing complications if these individuals are still shedding the virus. Antiviral treatment is also recommended if a person is hospitalized with suspected influenza instead of waiting for test results to return and if symptoms are worsening.[1][47] Most antiviral drugs against influenza fall into two categories: neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors and M2 inhibitors.[13] Baloxavir marboxil is a notable exception, which targets the endonuclease activity of the viral RNA polymerase and can be used as an alternative to NA and M2 inhibitors for influenza A virus and influenza B virus.[10][19][4]
 NA inhibitors target the enzymatic activity of NA receptors, mimicking the binding of sialic acid in the active site of NA on influenza A virus and influenza B virus virions[1] so that viral release from infected cells and the rate of viral replication are impaired.[11] NA inhibitors include oseltamivir, which is consumed orally in a prodrug form and converted to its active form in the liver, and zanamivir, which is a powder that is inhaled nasally. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective for prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis, and research overall indicates that NA inhibitors are effective at reducing rates of complications, hospitalization, and mortality[1] and the duration of illness.[13][47][4] Additionally, the earlier NA inhibitors are provided, the better the outcome,[4] though late administration can still be beneficial in severe cases.[1][47] Other NA inhibitors include laninamivir[1] and peramivir, the latter of which can be used as an alternative to oseltamivir for people who cannot tolerate or absorb it.[47]
 The adamantanes amantadine and rimantadine are orally administered drugs that block the influenza virus' M2 ion channel,[1] preventing viral uncoating.[4] These drugs are only functional against influenza A virus[47] but are no longer recommended for use because of widespread resistance to them among influenza A viruses.[4] Adamantane resistance first emerged in H3N2 in 2003, becoming worldwide by 2008. Oseltamivir resistance is no longer widespread because the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain (H1N1 pdm09), which is resistant to adamantanes, seemingly replaced resistant strains in circulation. Since the 2009 pandemic, oseltamivir resistance has mainly been observed in patients undergoing therapy,[1] especially the immunocompromised and young children.[4] Oseltamivir resistance is usually reported in H1N1, but has been reported in H3N2 and influenza B viruss less commonly.[1] Because of this, oseltamivir is recommended as the first drug of choice for immunocompetent people, whereas for the immunocompromised, oseltamivir is recommended against H3N2 and influenza B virus and zanamivir against H1N1 pdm09. Zanamivir resistance is observed less frequently, and resistance to peramivir and baloxavir marboxil is possible.[4]
 In healthy individuals, influenza infection is usually self-limiting and rarely fatal.[10][11] Symptoms usually last for 2–8 days.[13] Influenza can cause people to miss work or school, and it is associated with decreased job performance and, in older adults, reduced independence. Fatigue and malaise may last for several weeks after recovery, and healthy adults may experience pulmonary abnormalities that can take several weeks to resolve. Complications and mortality primarily occur in high-risk populations and those who are hospitalized. Severe disease and mortality are usually attributable to pneumonia from the primary viral infection or a secondary bacterial infection,[1][11] which can progress to ARDS.[13]
 Other respiratory complications that may occur include sinusitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, excess fluid buildup in the lungs, and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and asthma. Middle ear infection and croup may occur, most commonly in children.[10][1] Secondary S. aureus infection has been observed, primarily in children, to cause toxic shock syndrome after influenza, with hypotension, fever, and reddening and peeling of the skin.[1] Complications affecting the cardiovascular system are rare and include pericarditis, fulminant myocarditis with a fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat, and exacerbation of pre-existing cardiovascular disease.[10][11] Inflammation or swelling of muscles accompanied by muscle tissue breaking down occurs rarely, usually in children, which presents as extreme tenderness and muscle pain in the legs and a reluctance to walk for 2–3 days.[1][11][17]
 Influenza can affect pregnancy, including causing smaller neonatal size, increased risk of premature birth, and an increased risk of child death shortly before or after birth.[11] Neurological complications have been associated with influenza on rare occasions, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome.[17] Additionally, febrile seizures and Reye syndrome can occur, most commonly in children.[1][11] Influenza-associated encephalopathy can occur directly from central nervous system infection from the presence of the virus in blood and presents as sudden onset of fever with convulsions, followed by rapid progression to coma.[10] An atypical form of encephalitis called encephalitis lethargica, characterized by headache, drowsiness, and coma, may rarely occur sometime after infection.[1] In survivors of influenza-associated encephalopathy, neurological defects may occur.[10] Primarily in children, in severe cases the immune system may rarely dramatically overproduce white blood cells that release cytokines, causing severe inflammation.[10]
 People who are at least 65 years of age,[11] due to a weakened immune system from aging or a chronic illness, are a high-risk group for developing complications, as are children less than one year of age and children who have not been previously exposed to influenza viruses multiple times. Pregnant women are at an elevated risk, which increases by trimester[1] and lasts up to two weeks after childbirth.[11][47] Obesity, in particular a body mass index greater than 35–40, is associated with greater amounts of viral replication, increased severity of secondary bacterial infection, and reduced vaccination efficacy. People who have underlying health conditions are also considered at-risk, including those who have congenital or chronic heart problems or lung (e.g. asthma), kidney, liver, blood, neurological, or metabolic (e.g. diabetes) disorders,[10][1][11] as are people who are immunocompromised from chemotherapy, asplenia, prolonged steroid treatment, splenic dysfunction, or HIV infection.[11] Tobacco use, including past use, places a person at risk.[47] The role of genetics in influenza is not well researched,[1] but it may be a factor in influenza mortality.[13]
 Influenza is typically characterized by seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. Most of the burden of influenza is a result of flu seasons caused by influenza A virus and influenza B virus. Among influenza A virus subtypes, H1N1 and H3N2 circulate in humans and are responsible for seasonal influenza. Cases disproportionately occur in children, but most severe causes are among the elderly, the very young,[1] and the immunocompromised.[4] In a typical year, influenza viruses infect 5–15% of the global population,[3][54] causing 3–5 million cases of severe illness annually[1][2] and accounting for 290,000–650,000 deaths each year due to respiratory illness.[3][4][59] 5–10% of adults and 20–30% of children contract influenza each year.[23] The reported number of influenza cases is usually much lower than the actual number.[1][49]
 During seasonal epidemics, it is estimated that about 80% of otherwise healthy people who have a cough or sore throat have the flu.[1] Approximately 30–40% of people hospitalized for influenza develop pneumonia, and about 5% of all severe pneumonia cases in hospitals are due to influenza, which is also the most common cause of ARDS in adults. In children, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are the two most common causes of ARDS.[17] About 3–5% of children each year develop otitis media due to influenza.[10] Adults who develop organ failure from influenza and children who have PIM scores and acute renal failure have higher rates of mortality.[17] During seasonal influenza, mortality is concentrated in the very young and the elderly, whereas during flu pandemics, young adults are often affected at a high rate.[13]
 In temperate regions, the number of influenza cases varies from season to season. Lower vitamin D levels, presumably due to less sunlight,[42] lower humidity, lower temperature, and minor changes in virus proteins caused by antigenic drift contribute to annual epidemics that peak during the winter season. In the northern hemisphere, this is from October to May (more narrowly December to April[13]), and in the southern hemisphere, this is from May to October (more narrowly June to September[13]). There are therefore two distinct influenza seasons every year in temperate regions, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the southern hemisphere.[1][11][2] In tropical and subtropical regions, seasonality is more complex and appears to be affected by various climatic factors such as minimum temperature, hours of sunshine, maximum rainfall, and high humidity.[1][60] Influenza may therefore occur year-round in these regions.[13] Influenza epidemics in modern times have the tendency to start in the eastern or southern hemisphere,[60] with Asia being a key reservoir.[13]
 Influenza A virus and influenza B virus co-circulate, so have the same patterns of transmission.[1] The seasonality of influenza C virus, however, is poorly understood. Influenza C virus infection is most common in children under the age of two, and by adulthood most people have been exposed to it. Influenza C virus-associated hospitalization most commonly occurs in children under the age of three and is frequently accompanied by co-infection with another virus or a bacterium, which may increase the severity of disease. When considering all hospitalizations for respiratory illness among young children, influenza C virus appears to account for only a small percentage of such cases. Large outbreaks of influenza C virus infection can occur, so incidence varies significantly.[12]
 Outbreaks of influenza caused by novel influenza viruses are common.[30] Depending on the level of pre-existing immunity in the population, novel influenza viruses can spread rapidly and cause pandemics with millions of deaths. These pandemics, in contrast to seasonal influenza, are caused by antigenic shifts involving animal influenza viruses. To date, all known flu pandemics have been caused by influenza A viruses, and they follow the same pattern of spreading from an origin point to the rest of the world over the course of multiple waves in a year.[1][11][47] Pandemic strains tend to be associated with higher rates of pneumonia in otherwise healthy individuals.[17] Generally after each influenza pandemic, the pandemic strain continues to circulate as the cause of seasonal influenza, replacing prior strains.[1] From 1700 to 1889, influenza pandemics occurred about once every 50–60 years. Since then, pandemics have occurred about once every 10–50 years, so they may be getting more frequent over time.[60]
 The first influenza epidemic may have occurred around 6,000 BC in China,[62] and possible descriptions of influenza exist in Greek writings from the 5th century BC.[60][63] In both 1173–1174 AD and 1387 AD, epidemics occurred across Europe that were named ""influenza"". Whether these epidemics or others were caused by influenza is unclear since there was then no consistent naming pattern for epidemic respiratory diseases, and ""influenza"" did not become clearly associated with respiratory disease until centuries later.[64] Influenza may have been brought to the Americas as early as 1493, when an epidemic disease resembling influenza killed most of the population of the Antilles.[65][66]
 The first convincing record of an influenza pandemic was in 1510. It began in East Asia before spreading to North Africa and then Europe.[67] Following the pandemic, seasonal influenza occurred, with subsequent pandemics in 1557 and 1580.[64] The flu pandemic in 1557 was potentially the first time influenza was connected to miscarriage and death of pregnant women.[68] The 1580 influenza pandemic originated in Asia during summer, spread to Africa, then Europe, and finally America.[60] By the end of the 16th century, influenza was beginning to become understood as a specific, recognizable disease with epidemic and endemic forms.[64] In 1648, it was discovered that horses also experience influenza.[67]
 Influenza data after 1700 is more accurate, so it is easier to identify flu pandemics after this point.[69] The first flu pandemic of the 18th century started in 1729 in Russia in spring, spreading worldwide over the course of three years with distinct waves, the later ones being more lethal. Another flu pandemic occurred in 1781–1782, starting in China in autumn.[60] From this pandemic, influenza became associated with sudden outbreaks of febrile illness.[69] The next flu pandemic was from 1830 to 1833, beginning in China in winter. This pandemic had a high attack rate, but the mortality rate was low.[34][60]
 A minor influenza pandemic occurred from 1847 to 1851 at the same time as the third cholera pandemic and was the first flu pandemic to occur with vital statistics being recorded, so influenza mortality was clearly recorded for the first time.[69] Fowl plague (now recognised as highly pathogenic avian influenza) was recognized in 1878[69] and was soon linked to transmission to humans.[67] By the time of the 1889 pandemic, which may have been caused by an H2N2 strain,[70] the flu had become an easily recognizable disease.[67]
 The microbial agent responsible for influenza was incorrectly identified in 1892 by R. F. J. Pfeiffer as the bacteria species Haemophilus influenzae, which retains ""influenza"" in its name.[67][69] From 1901 to 1903, Italian and Austrian researchers were able to show that avian influenza, then called ""fowl plague"",[35] was caused by a microscopic agent smaller than bacteria by using filters with pores too small for bacteria to pass through. The fundamental differences between viruses and bacteria, however, were not yet fully understood.[69]
 From 1918 to 1920, the Spanish flu pandemic became the most devastating influenza pandemic and one of the deadliest pandemics in history. The pandemic, caused by an H1N1 strain of influenza A,[72] likely began in the United States before spreading worldwide via soldiers during and after the First World War. The initial wave in the first half of 1918 was relatively minor and resembled past flu pandemics, but the second wave later that year had a much higher mortality rate.[60] A third wave with lower mortality occurred in many places a few months after the second.[34] By the end of 1920, it is estimated that about a third[13] to half of all people in the world had been infected, with tens of millions of deaths, disproportionately young adults.[60] During the 1918 pandemic, the respiratory route of transmission was clearly identified[34] and influenza was shown to be caused by a ""filter passer"", not a bacterium, but there remained a lack of agreement about influenza's cause for another decade and research on influenza declined.[69] After the pandemic, H1N1 circulated in humans in seasonal form[1] until the next pandemic.[69]
 In 1931, Richard Shope published three papers identifying a virus as the cause of swine influenza, a then newly recognized disease among pigs that was characterized during the second wave of the 1918 pandemic.[68][69] Shope's research reinvigorated research on human influenza, and many advances in virology, serology, immunology, experimental animal models, vaccinology, and immunotherapy have since arisen from influenza research.[69] Just two years after influenza viruses were discovered, in 1933, influenza A virus was identified as the agent responsible for human influenza.[68][73] Subtypes of influenza A virus were discovered throughout the 1930s,[69] and influenza B virus was discovered in 1940.[23]
 During the Second World War, the US government worked on developing inactivated vaccines for influenza, resulting in the first influenza vaccine being licensed in 1945 in the United States.[1] Influenza C virus was discovered two years later in 1947.[23] In 1955, avian influenza was confirmed to be caused by influenza A virus.[35] Four influenza pandemics have occurred since WWII. The first of these was the Asian flu from 1957 to 1958, caused by an H2N2 strain[1][52] and beginning in China's Yunnan province. The number of deaths probably exceeded one million, mostly among the very young and very old.[60] This was the first flu pandemic to occur in the presence of a global surveillance system and laboratories able to study the novel influenza virus.[34] After the pandemic, H2N2 was the influenza A virus subtype responsible for seasonal influenza.[1] The first antiviral drug against influenza, amantadine, was approved in 1966, with additional antiviral drugs being used since the 1990s.[4]
 In 1968, H3N2 was introduced into humans through a rearrangement between an avian H3N2 strain and an H2N2 strain that was circulating in humans. The novel H3N2 strain emerged in Hong Kong and spread worldwide, causing the Hong Kong flu pandemic, which resulted in 500,000–2,000,000 deaths. This was the first pandemic to spread significantly by air travel.[3][34] H2N2 and H3N2 co-circulated after the pandemic until 1971 when H2N2 waned in prevalence and was completely replaced by H3N2.[3] In 1977, H1N1 reemerged in humans, possibly after it was released from a freezer in a laboratory accident, and caused a pseudo-pandemic.[34][69] This H1N1 strain was antigenically similar to the H1N1 strains that circulated prior to 1957. Since 1977, both H1N1 and H3N2 have circulated in humans as part of seasonal influenza.[1] In 1980, the classification system used to subtype influenza viruses was introduced.[74]
 At some point, influenza B virus diverged into two strains, named the B/Victoria-like and B/Yamagata-like lineages, both of which have been circulating in humans since 1983.[23]
 In 1996, a highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype of influenza A was detected in geese in Guangdong, China[35] and a year later emerged in poultry in Hong Kong, gradually spreading worldwide from there. A small H5N1 outbreak in humans in Hong Kong occurred then,[45] and sporadic human cases have occurred since 1997, carrying a high case fatality rate.[19][54]
 The most recent flu pandemic was the 2009 swine flu pandemic, which originated in Mexico and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths.[34] It was caused by a novel H1N1 strain that was a reassortment of human, swine, and avian influenza viruses.[20][4] The 2009 pandemic had the effect of replacing prior H1N1 strains in circulation with the novel strain but not any other influenza viruses. Consequently, H1N1, H3N2, and both influenza B virus lineages have been in circulation in seasonal form since the 2009 pandemic.[1][34][35]
 In 2011, influenza D virus was discovered in pigs in Oklahoma, USA, and cattle were later identified as the primary reservoir of influenza D virus.[12][23]
 In the same year,[54] avian H7N9 was detected in China and began to cause human infections in 2013, starting in Shanghai and Anhui and remaining mostly in China. Highly pathogenic H7N9 emerged sometime in 2016 and has occasionally infected humans incidentally. Other avian influenza viruses have less commonly infected humans since the 1990s, including H5N1, H5N5, H5N6, H5N8, H6N1, H7N2, H7N7, and H10N7, and have begun to spread throughout much of the world since the 2010s.[19] Future flu pandemics, which may be caused by an influenza virus of avian origin,[35] are viewed as almost inevitable, and increased globalization has made it easier for a pandemic virus to spread,[34] so there are continual efforts to prepare for future pandemics[68] and improve the prevention and treatment of influenza.[1]
 The word influenza comes from the Italian word influenza, from medieval Latin influentia, originally meaning 'visitation' or 'influence'. Terms such as influenza di freddo, meaning 'influence of the cold', and influenza di stelle, meaning 'influence of the stars' are attested from the 14th century. The latter referred to the disease's cause, which at the time was ascribed by some to unfavorable astrological conditions. As early as 1504, influenza began to mean a 'visitation' or 'outbreak' of any disease affecting many people in a single place at once. During an outbreak of influenza in 1743 that started in Italy and spread throughout Europe, the word reached the English language and was anglicized in pronunciation. Since the mid-1800s, influenza has also been used to refer to severe colds.[75][76][77] The shortened form of the word, ""flu"", is first attested in 1839 as flue with the spelling flu confirmed in 1893.[78] Other names that have been used for influenza include epidemic catarrh, la grippe from French, sweating sickness, and, especially when referring to the 1918 pandemic strain, Spanish fever.[79]
 Aquatic birds such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and gulls are the primary reservoir of influenza A viruses (IAVs).[19][20]
 Because of the impact of avian influenza on economically important chicken farms, a classification system was devised in 1981 which divided avian virus strains as either highly pathogenic (and therefore potentially requiring vigorous control measures) or low pathogenic. The test for this is based solely on the effect on chickens - a virus strain is highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) if 75% or more of chickens die after being deliberately infected with it. The alternative classification is low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) which produces mild or no symptoms.[80] This classification system has since been modified to take into account the structure of the virus' haemagglutinin protein.[81] At the genetic level, an AIV can be identified as an HPAI virus if it has a multibasic cleavage site in the HA protein, which contains additional residues in the HA gene.[20][35] Other species of birds, especially water birds, can become infected with HPAI virus without experiencing severe symptoms and can spread the infection over large distances; the exact symptoms depend on the species of bird and the strain of virus.[80] Classification of an avian virus strain as HPAI or LPAI does not predict how serious the disease might be if it infects humans or other mammals.[80][82]
 Symptoms of HPAI infection in chickens include lack of energy and appetite, decreased egg production, soft-shelled or misshapen eggs, swelling of the head, comb, wattles, and hocks, purple discoloration of wattles, combs, and legs, nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing, incoordination, and diarrhea; birds infected with an HPAI virus may also die suddenly without any signs of infection.[53] Notable HPAI viruses include influenza A (H5N1) and A (H7N9). HPAI viruses have been a major disease burden in the 21st century, resulting in the death of large numbers of birds. In H7N9's case, some circulating strains were originally low pathogenic but became high pathogenic by mutating to acquire the HA multibasic cleavage site. Avian H9N2 is also of concern because although it is low pathogenic, it is a common donor of genes to H5N1 and H7N9 during reassortment.[1]
 Migratory birds can spread influenza across long distances. An example of this was when an H5N1 strain in 2005 infected birds at Qinghai Lake, China, which is a stopover and breeding site for many migratory birds, subsequently spreading the virus to more than 20 countries across Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.[19][35] AIVs can be transmitted from wild birds to domestic free-range ducks and in turn to poultry through contaminated water, aerosols, and fomites.[1] Ducks therefore act as key intermediates between wild and domestic birds.[35] Transmission to poultry typically occurs in backyard farming and live animal markets where multiple species interact with each other. From there, AIVs can spread to poultry farms in the absence of adequate biosecurity. Among poultry, HPAI transmission occurs through aerosols and contaminated feces,[1] cages, feed, and dead animals.[19] Back-transmission of HPAI viruses from poultry to wild birds has occurred and is implicated in mass die-offs and intercontinental spread.[20]
 AIVs have occasionally infected humans through aerosols, fomites, and contaminated water.[1] Direction transmission from wild birds is rare.[35] Instead, most transmission involves domestic poultry, mainly chickens, ducks, and geese but also a variety of other birds such as guinea fowl, partridge, pheasants, and quails.[20] The primary risk factor for infection with AIVs is exposure to birds in farms and live poultry markets.[19] Typically, infection with an AIV has an incubation period of 3–5 days but can be up to 9 days. H5N1 and H7N9 cause severe lower respiratory tract illness, whereas other AIVs such as H9N2 cause a more mild upper respiratory tract illness, commonly with conjunctivitis.[1] Limited transmission of avian H2, H5-7, H9, and H10 subtypes from one person to another through respiratory droplets, aerosols, and fomites has occurred, but sustained human-to-human transmission of AIVs has not occurred.[1][2]
 Influenza in pigs is a respiratory disease similar to influenza in humans and is found worldwide. Asymptomatic infections are common. Symptoms typically appear 1–3 days after infection and include fever, lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, labored breathing, coughing, sneezing, and nasal discharge. In sows, pregnancy may be aborted. Complications include secondary infections and potentially fatal bronchopneumonia. Pigs become contagious within a day of infection and typically spread the virus for 7–10 days, which can spread rapidly within a herd. Pigs usually recover within 3–7 days after symptoms appear. Prevention and control measures include inactivated vaccines and culling infected herds. Influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 are usually responsible for swine flu.[83]
 Some influenza A viruses can be transmitted via aerosols from pigs to humans and vice versa.[1] Pigs, along with bats and quails,[23] are recognized as a mixing vessel of influenza viruses because they have both α-2,3 and α-2,6 sialic acid receptors in their respiratory tract. Because of that, both avian and mammalian influenza viruses can infect pigs. If co-infection occurs, reassortment is possible.[20] A notable example of this was the reassortment of a swine, avian, and human influenza virus that caused the 2009 flu pandemic.[20][4] Spillover events from humans to pigs appear to be more common than from pigs to humans.[20]
 Influenza viruses have been found in many other animals, including cattle, horses, dogs, cats, and marine mammals. Nearly all influenza A viruses are apparently descended from ancestral viruses in birds. The exception are bat influenza-like viruses, which have an uncertain origin. These bat viruses have HA and NA subtypes H17, H18, N10, and N11. H17N10 and H18N11 are unable to reassort with other influenza A viruses, but they are still able to replicate in other mammals.[1]
 Equine influenza A viruses include H7N7 and two lineages[1] of H3N8. H7N7, however, has not been detected in horses since the late 1970s,[30] so it may have become extinct in horses.[20] H3N8 in equines spreads via aerosols and causes respiratory illness.[1] Equine H3N8 preferentially binds to α-2,3 sialic acids, so horses are usually considered dead-end hosts, but transmission to dogs and camels has occurred, raising concerns that horses may be mixing vessels for reassortment. In canines, the only influenza A viruses in circulation are equine-derived H3N8 and avian-derived H3N2. Canine H3N8 has not been observed to reassort with other subtypes. H3N2 has a much broader host range and can reassort with H1N1 and H5N1. An isolated case of H6N1, likely from a chicken, was found infecting a dog, so other AIVs may emerge in canines.[20]
 A wide range of other mammals have been affected by avian influenza A viruses, generally due to eating birds which had been infected.[84] There have been instances where transmission of the disease between mammals, including seals and cows, may have occurred.[85][86][30] Various mutations have been identified that are associated with AIVs adapting to mammals. Since HA proteins vary in which sialic acids they bind to, mutations in the HA receptor binding site can allow AIVs to infect mammals. Other mutations include mutations affecting which sialic acids NA proteins cleave and a mutation in the PB2 polymerase subunit that improves tolerance of lower temperatures in mammalian respiratory tracts and enhances RNP assembly by stabilizing NP and PB2 binding.[20]
 Influenza B virus is mainly found in humans but has also been detected in pigs, dogs, horses, and seals.[23] Likewise, influenza C virus primarily infects humans but has been observed in pigs, dogs, cattle, and dromedary camels.[12][23] Influenza D virus causes an influenza-like illness in pigs but its impact in its natural reservoir, cattle, is relatively unknown. It may cause respiratory disease resembling human influenza on its own, or it may be part of a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex with other pathogens during co-infection. BRD is a concern for the cattle industry, so influenza D virus' possible involvement in BRD has led to research on vaccines for cattle that can provide protection against influenza D virus.[23][26] Two antigenic lineages are in circulation: D/swine/Oklahoma/1334/2011 (D/OK) and D/bovine/Oklahoma/660/2013 (D/660).[23]

"Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia, a blood disorder that affects your red blood cells. Iron-deficiency symptoms develop over time. Healthcare providers may treat iron-deficiency anemia by diagnosing and treating the condition that caused anemia and/or by prescribing iron supplements. Iron-deficiency anemia is a blood disorder that affects your red blood cells. It’s the most common form of anemia. It happens when your body doesn’t have enough iron to make hemoglobin, a substance in your red blood cell that allows them to carry oxygen throughout your body. As a result, iron deficiency may cause you to feel short of breath or tired. These symptoms develop over time. When iron deficiency is diagnosed, you may be prescribed iron supplements. Healthcare providers will also ask questions and do tests to determine why you developed iron deficiency. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Iron-deficiency anemia symptoms happen over time. Initially, you may have low iron and feel fine or have symptoms that are so mild you don’t notice them. Left untreated, however, iron-deficiency anemia can make you feel tired and weak. You may notice pale skin and cold hands and feet. Iron-deficiency anemia can also cause you to feel dizzy or lightheaded. Occasionally, it can cause chest pain, a fast heartbeat and shortness of breath. Iron deficiency can cause you to have unusual cravings for non-food items such as ice, dirt or paper. Normally, your body brings in a steady flow of iron from the food you eat. Your body stores excess iron so it’s available as needed to make hemoglobin. Iron-deficiency anemia develops when your body uses the iron stores faster than they can be refilled, or when the flow of iron into your system has slowed. This occurs in three stages: Advertisement Almost anyone can develop iron-deficiency anemia. That said, women who have menstrual cycles or who are pregnant or breastfeeding are more likely to develop iron-deficiency anemia than women who have gone through menopause or men. Here are other groups of people who have an increased risk of developing iron-deficiency anemia: Losing blood is the most common reason people develop iron-deficiency anemia. Some common reasons include: Advertisement People can develop iron-deficiency anemia because they don’t get enough iron from food or they have conditions that limit the amount of iron their bodies absorb. There are several reasons why your body may not absorb iron, including: Iron-deficiency symptoms develop over time and may initially be mild but can worsen over time if not treated. Common iron-deficiency symptoms include: Some common signs you may have this condition include: Iron-deficiency anemia is diagnosed with blood tests. If you have iron-deficiency anemia, your healthcare provider may do additional tests to find the cause. Steps your healthcare provider might take to diagnose iron-deficiency anemia include: Iron deficiency can be treated with iron supplements, usually as pills and sometimes with an IV. Your healthcare provider will try to identify why you’re low in iron. Most of the time, people have iron-deficiency anemia because they’re losing blood or they’re not absorbing iron in their diet. Healthcare providers treat iron-deficiency anemia by diagnosing and, if possible, treating the underlying cause while treating the iron deficiency. Everyone’s situation may be a bit different. Your healthcare provider may prescribe iron supplements to restore iron lost from excessive bleeding or if you’re not getting enough iron from food. If you have a condition that keeps you from absorbing iron, they may prescribe intravenous (IV) iron supplements. Sometimes, iron supplements can cause constipation or make your poop look dark or black. If you’re having trouble with constipation, your healthcare provider will have suggestions for ways to soften it. It can take three to six weeks before iron supplements begin building up your iron reserves. Your healthcare provider will monitor your iron levels and let you know when your iron levels have improved. Even then, they may recommend taking iron supplements for at least six months so your body can replenish its iron stores. Most people develop iron-deficiency anemia because they’re losing blood or not absorbing it from their diet. If you think you have these issues, ask your healthcare provider what you can do to avoid iron-deficiency anemia. You can reduce your risk by eating an iron-rich diet. Here are some iron-rich food groups to consider: If you follow a vegan or vegetarian diet, look for iron-fortified breads and cereals. There are several non-meat options for boosting your iron intake, like beans, tofu, dried fruits and dark leafy greens. You may want to take an iron supplement. Ask your healthcare provider about appropriate iron supplements so you don’t overload on iron.

"Anemia - iron deficiency Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types and causes of anemia. Iron deficiency anemia occurs when your body does not have enough iron. Iron helps make red blood cells. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia. In the presence of some anemias, the body increases production of red blood cells (RBCs), and sends these cells into the bloodstream before they are mature.  These slightly immature cells are called reticulocytes, and are characterized by a network of filaments and granules.  Reticulocytes normally make up 1% of the total RBC count, but may exceed levels of 4% when compensating for anemia. Blood is comprised of red blood cells, platelets, and various white blood cells. Hemoglobin is the most important component of red blood cells. It is composed of a protein called heme, which binds oxygen. In the lungs, oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide. Abnormalities of an individual's hemoglobin value can indicate defects in the normal balance between red blood cell production and destruction. Both low and high values can indicate disease states. Red blood cells bring oxygen to your body's tissues. Red blood cells are made in your bone marrow. Red blood cells circulate through your body for 3 to 4 months. Parts of your body, such as your spleen, remove old blood cells.Iron is a key part of red blood cells. Without iron to make hemoglobin, your blood cannot carry oxygen effectively. Your body normally gets iron through your diet. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.Iron deficiency anemia develops when your body's iron stores run low. This can occur because:You lose more blood cells and iron than your body can replaceYour body does not absorb iron wellYour body is able to absorb iron, but you are not eating enough foods that contain ironYour body needs more iron than normal (such as if you are pregnant or breastfeeding) Bleeding can cause iron loss. Common causes of bleeding are:Heavy, long, or frequent menstrual periodsCancer in the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, or colonEsophageal varices, often from cirrhosisThe use of aspirin, ibuprofen, or medicines that may thin the blood for a long time, which can cause gastrointestinal bleedingPeptic ulcer diseaseYour body may not absorb enough iron in your diet due to:Celiac diseaseCrohn diseaseGastric bypass surgeryTaking too many antacids or too much of the antibiotic tetracycline You may not get enough iron in your diet if:You are a strict vegetarianYou do not eat enough foods that contain iron  Red blood cells bring oxygen to your body's tissues.

Iron is a key part of red blood cells. Without iron to make hemoglobin, your blood cannot carry oxygen effectively. Your body normally gets iron through your diet. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells. Iron deficiency anemia develops when your body's iron stores run low. This can occur because: Bleeding can cause iron loss. Common causes of bleeding are: Your body may not absorb enough iron in your diet due to: You may not get enough iron in your diet if: To be anemic means that there aren't enough red blood cells flowing throughout your body. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body, so if you're anemic, everything from your brain, to your heart, to your muscles aren't getting enough oxygen to run properly. Iron is a key part of red blood cells. When your body doesn't have enough iron, it'll make fewer red blood cells or make cells that are just too small. If you lose enough iron, you'll wind up with iron deficiency anemia - the most common form of anemia. So, what causes iron deficiency anemia? There are basically three main ways you can become iron deficient. First, bleeding can cause you to lose more blood cells and iron than your body can replace. Bleeding due to ulcers, cancers, taking aspirin or other medicines can cause anemia. In women, this can happen because of heavy or frequent menstrual periods. The second way, your body isn't properly absorbing iron, perhaps, due to an intestinal disease. Some surgeries, like gastric bypass, can lead to anemia. You can also develop anemia if you take too many antacids that contain calcium. Lastly and much less common, is because of inadequate iron in your diet. We see this in strict vegetarians and older folks who simply just don't eat enough food. In many cases, mild iron deficiency anemia comes on so gradually that you may not even know you're anemic. Symptoms of mild anemia are subtle and include feeling grumpy, weak or tired more often than usual and getting headaches or perhaps having problems concentrating. But as the anemia gets worse, you may develop a blue color to the whites of your eyes, light-headedness when you go to stand up and you may look pale or experience shortness of breath. To find out if you've got iron-deficiency anemia. See your doctor; your doctor will start with a Complete Blood Count or CBC test. That'll tell you and your doctor your white, red blood cell and platelet counts. If you're anemic and have small red blood cells, that suggests iron deficiency anemia, so iron studies like serum iron, total iron binding capacity and ferritin level tests should be done. So, what steps can you take -- It's important that your diet include enough iron. Red meat, chicken, turkey. liver, and egg yolks are important sources of iron. Flour, bread, and some cereals are fortified with iron. Sometimes people with anemia take iron supplements to build up iron stores in their bodies. But the thing is - It's not enough just to take extra iron at your doctor's direction...Your doctor needs to find out WHY you've got iron deficiency anemia and treat that underlying cause. You may have no symptoms if the anemia is mild.Most of the time, symptoms are mild at first and develop slowly. Symptoms may include:Feeling weak or tired more often than usual, or with exerciseHeadachesDizzinessPalpitationsProblems concentrating or thinking As the anemia gets worse, symptoms may include:Brittle nailsBlue color to the whites of the eyeDesire to eat ice or other non-food things (pica)Feeling lightheaded when you stand upPale skin colorShortness of breathSore or inflamed tongueMouth ulcersUncontrolled movement of legs (during sleep)Hair lossSymptoms of the conditions associated with bleeding that cause iron deficiency anemia include:Dark, tar-colored stools or blood in the stoolHeavy menstrual bleedingPain in the upper belly (from ulcers) You may have no symptoms if the anemia is mild. Most of the time, symptoms are mild at first and develop slowly. Symptoms may include: As the anemia gets worse, symptoms may include: Symptoms of the conditions associated with bleeding that cause iron deficiency anemia include: To diagnose anemia, your health care provider may order these blood tests:Complete blood count (CBC)Reticulocyte count To check iron levels, your provider may order:Serum iron levelTotal iron binding capacity (TIBC) in the bloodSerum ferritinBone marrow biopsy (if the diagnosis is not clear)To check for causes of blood loss, your provider may order:ColonoscopyFecal occult blood testUpper endoscopyTests to detect sources of blood loss in the urinary tract or uterus  To diagnose anemia, your health care provider may order these blood tests: To check iron levels, your provider may order: To check for causes of blood loss, your provider may order: Treatment may include taking iron supplements and eating iron-rich foods.Iron supplements (most often ferrous sulfate) build up the iron stores in your body. Most of the time, your provider will measure your iron level before you start supplements.If you cannot take iron by mouth, you may need to take it through a vein (intravenous) or by an injection into the muscle.Pregnant and breastfeeding women will need to take extra iron because they often cannot get enough iron from their normal diet.Often your anemia will improve or resolve with 6 weeks of iron therapy.

 Iron deficiency anaemia is caused by lack of iron, often because of blood loss or pregnancy. It's treated with iron tablets and by eating iron-rich foods. Symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia can include: Less common symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia (that are not usually connected to pregnancy) include: To check if you have iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will ask you about your lifestyle and medical history. If the reason for the anaemia is not clear, they might order some tests to find out what might be causing the symptoms. They might also refer you to a specialist for further checks. The GP will usually order a full blood count (FBC) test. This will find out if the number of red blood cells you have (your red blood cell count) is normal. You do not need to do anything to prepare for this test. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type of anaemia. There are other types, like vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia, that the blood test will also check for. Once the reason you have iron deficiency anaemia has been found (for example, an ulcer or heavy periods) the GP will recommend treatment. If the blood test shows your red blood cell count is low, iron tablets will be recommended to replace the iron that's missing from your body. You'll need to take them for about 6 months. Drinking orange juice after you've taken a tablet may help your body absorb the iron. Follow the GP's advice about how to take iron tablets. Some people get side effects when taking iron tablets like: Try taking the tablets with or soon after food to reduce the chance of side effects. It's important to keep taking the tablets, even if you get side effects. Your GP may carry out repeat blood tests over the next few months to check that your iron level is getting back to normal. Keep iron supplement tablets out of the reach of children. An overdose of iron in a young child can be fatal. If your diet is partly causing your iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will tell you what foods are rich in iron so you can eat more of them. Eat more: Eat and drink less: Large amounts of these foods and drinks make it harder for your body to absorb iron. You might be referred to a specialist dietitian if you're finding it hard to include iron in your diet. Heavy periods and pregnancy are very common causes of iron deficiency anaemia. Heavy periods can be treated with medicine. In pregnancy, iron deficiency anaemia is most often caused by a lack of iron in your diet. Bleeding in the stomach and intestines is another common cause of iron deficiency anaemia. This can be caused by: Any other conditions or actions that cause blood loss could also lead to iron deficiency anaemia. Untreated iron deficiency anaemia:

"To diagnose iron deficiency anemia, your doctor may run tests to look for: If your bloodwork indicates iron deficiency anemia, your doctor may order additional tests to identify an underlying cause, such as: Your doctor may order these or other tests after a trial period of treatment with iron supplementation. To treat iron deficiency anemia, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements. Your doctor will also treat the underlying cause of your iron deficiency, if necessary. Your doctor may recommend over-the-counter iron tablets to replenish the iron stores in your body. Your doctor will let you know the correct dose for you. Iron is also available in liquid form for infants and children. To improve the chances that your body will absorb the iron in the tablets, you may be instructed to: Iron supplements can cause constipation, so your doctor may also recommend a stool softener. Iron may turn your stools black, which is a harmless side effect. Iron deficiency can't be corrected overnight. You may need to take iron supplements for several months or longer to replenish your iron reserves. Generally, you'll start to feel better after a week or so of treatment. Ask your doctor when to have your blood rechecked to measure your iron levels. To be sure that your iron reserves are replenished, you may need to take iron supplements for a year or more. If iron supplements don't increase your blood-iron levels, it's likely the anemia is due to a source of bleeding or an iron-absorption problem that your doctor will need to investigate and treat. Depending on the cause, iron deficiency anemia treatment may involve: If iron deficiency anemia is severe, you may need iron given intravenously or you may need blood transfusions to help replace iron and hemoglobin quickly. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs and symptoms that worry you. If you're diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia, you may need tests to look for a source of blood loss, including tests to examine your gastrointestinal tract. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, and what to expect from your doctor. Your time with your doctor is limited, so preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time together. For iron deficiency anemia, some basic questions to ask your doctor include: In addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment. Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over points you want to spend more time on.

"Iron deficiency anemia is a common type of anemia — a condition in which blood lacks adequate healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen to the body's tissues. As the name implies, iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient iron. Without enough iron, your body can't produce enough of a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen (hemoglobin). As a result, iron deficiency anemia may leave you tired and short of breath. You can usually correct iron deficiency anemia with iron supplementation. Sometimes additional tests or treatments for iron deficiency anemia are necessary, especially if your doctor suspects that you're bleeding internally. Initially, iron deficiency anemia can be so mild that it goes unnoticed. But as the body becomes more deficient in iron and anemia worsens, the signs and symptoms intensify. Iron deficiency anemia signs and symptoms may include: If you or your child develops signs and symptoms that suggest iron deficiency anemia, see your doctor. Iron deficiency anemia isn't something to self-diagnose or treat. So see your doctor for a diagnosis rather than taking iron supplements on your own. Overloading the body with iron can be dangerous because excess iron accumulation can damage your liver and cause other complications. Iron deficiency anemia occurs when your body doesn't have enough iron to produce hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the part of red blood cells that gives blood its red color and enables the red blood cells to carry oxygenated blood throughout your body. If you aren't consuming enough iron, or if you're losing too much iron, your body can't produce enough hemoglobin, and iron deficiency anemia will eventually develop. Causes of iron deficiency anemia include: These groups of people may have an increased risk of iron deficiency anemia: Mild iron deficiency anemia usually doesn't cause complications. However, left untreated, iron deficiency anemia can become severe and lead to health problems, including the following: You can reduce your risk of iron deficiency anemia by choosing iron-rich foods. Foods rich in iron include: Your body absorbs more iron from meat than it does from other sources. If you choose to not eat meat, you may need to increase your intake of iron-rich, plant-based foods to absorb the same amount of iron as does someone who eats meat. You can enhance your body's absorption of iron by drinking citrus juice or eating other foods rich in vitamin C at the same time that you eat high-iron foods. Vitamin C in citrus juices, like orange juice, helps your body to better absorb dietary iron. Vitamin C is also found in: To prevent iron deficiency anemia in infants, feed your baby breast milk or iron-fortified formula for the first year. Cow's milk isn't a good source of iron for babies and isn't recommended for infants under 1 year. After age 6 months, start feeding your baby iron-fortified cereals or pureed meats at least twice a day to boost iron intake. After one year, be sure children don't drink more than 20 ounces (591 milliliters) of milk a day. Too much milk often takes the place of other foods, including those that are rich in iron.

"Kuru is a rare, incurable, and fatal neurodegenerative disorder that was formerly common among the Fore people of Papua New Guinea. Kuru is a form of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) caused by the transmission of abnormally folded proteins (prions), which leads to symptoms such as tremors and loss of coordination from neurodegeneration.
 The term kuru derives from the Fore word kuria or guria (""to shake""),[2] due to the body tremors that are a classic symptom of the disease. Kúru itself means ""trembling"".[3] It is also known as the ""laughing sickness"" due to the pathologic bursts of laughter which are a symptom of the disease. It is now widely accepted that kuru was transmitted among members of the Fore tribe of Papua New Guinea via funerary cannibalism. Deceased family members were traditionally cooked and eaten, which was thought to help free the spirit of the dead.[4] Women and children usually consumed the brain, the organ in which infectious prions were most concentrated, thus allowing for transmission of kuru. The disease was therefore more prevalent among women and children.
 The epidemic likely started when a villager developed sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and died. When villagers ate the brain, they contracted the disease and then spread it to other villagers who ate their infected brains.[5]
 While the Fore people stopped consuming human meat in the early 1960s, when it was first speculated to be transmitted via endocannibalism, the disease lingered due to kuru's long incubation period of anywhere from 10 to over 50 years.[6] The epidemic finally declined sharply after half a century, from 200 deaths per year in 1957 to no deaths from at least 2010 onwards, with sources disagreeing on whether the last known kuru victim died in 2005 or 2009.[7][8][9][10]
 Kuru, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, is a disease of the nervous system that causes physiological and neurological effects which ultimately lead to death. It is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, or loss of coordination and control over muscle movements.[11][12]
 The preclinical or asymptomatic phase, also called the incubation period, averages 10–13 years, but can be as short as five and has been estimated to last as long as 50 years or more after initial exposure.[13]
 The clinical stage, which begins at the first onset of symptoms, lasts an average of 12 months. The clinical progression of kuru is divided into three specific stages: the ambulant, sedentary and terminal stages. While there is some variation in these stages from individual to individual, they are highly conserved among the affected population.[11] Before the onset of clinical symptoms, an individual can also present with prodromal symptoms including headache and joint pain in the legs.[14]
 In the ambulant stage, the infected individual may exhibit unsteady stance and gait, decreased muscle control, difficulty pronouncing words (dysarthria), and tremors (titubation). This stage is named the ambulant because the individual is still able to walk around despite symptoms.[14]
 In the sedentary stage, the infected individual is incapable of walking without support and experiences ataxia and severe tremors. Furthermore, the individual shows signs of emotional instability and depression, yet exhibits uncontrolled and sporadic laughter. Despite the other neurological symptoms, tendon reflexes are still intact at this stage of the disease.[14]
 In the terminal stage, the infected individual's existing symptoms, like ataxia, progress to the point where it is no longer possible to sit up without support. New symptoms also emerge: the individual develops dysphagia, which can lead to severe malnutrition, and may also become incontinent, lose the ability or will to speak, and become unresponsive to their surroundings despite maintaining consciousness.[14] Towards the end of the terminal stage, patients often develop chronic decubitus ulcerated wounds that can be easily infected. An infected person usually dies within three months to two years after the first terminal stage symptoms, often because of aspiration pneumonia[15] or other secondary infections.[16]
 Kuru is largely localized to the Fore people and people with whom they intermarried.[17] The Fore people ritualistically cooked and consumed body parts of their family members following their death to incorporate ""the body of the dead person into the bodies of living relatives, thus helping to free the spirit of the dead"".[18] Because the brain is the organ enriched in the infectious prion, women and children, who consumed brain, had a much higher likelihood of being infected than men, who preferentially consumed muscles.[19]
 The infectious agent is a misfolded form of a host-encoded protein called prion (PrP). Prion proteins are encoded by the Prion Protein Gene (PRNP).[21] The two forms of prion are designated as PrPc, which is a normally folded protein, and PrPsc, a misfolded form which gives rise to the disease. The two forms do not differ in their amino acid sequence; however, the pathogenic PrPsc isoform differs from the normal PrPc form in its secondary and tertiary structure. The PrPsc isoform is more enriched in beta sheets, while the normal PrPc form is enriched in alpha helices.[19] The differences in conformation allow PrPsc to aggregate and be extremely resistant to protein degradation by enzymes or by other chemical and physical means. The normal form, on the other hand, is susceptible to complete proteolysis and soluble in non-denaturing detergents.[14]
 It has been suggested that pre-existing or acquired PrPsc can promote the conversion of PrPc into PrPsc, which goes on to convert other PrPc. This initiates a chain reaction that allows for its rapid propagation, resulting in the pathogenesis of prion diseases.[14]
 In 1961, Australian medical researcher Michael Alpers conducted extensive field studies among the Fore accompanied by anthropologist Shirley Lindenbaum.[9] Their historical research suggested the epidemic may have originated around 1900 from a single individual who lived on the edge of Fore territory and who is thought to have spontaneously developed some form of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.[22] Alpers and Lindenbaum's research conclusively demonstrated that kuru spread easily and rapidly in the Fore people due to their endocannibalistic funeral practices, in which relatives consumed the bodies of the dead to return the person's ""life force"" to the hamlet, a Fore social subunit.[23] Corpses of family members were often buried for days, then exhumed once the corpses were colonized by insect larvae, at which point the corpse would be dismembered and served with the larvae as a side dish.[24]
 The demographic distribution evident in the infection rates – kuru was eight to nine times more prevalent in women and children than in men at its peak – is because Fore men considered consuming human flesh to weaken them in times of conflict or battle, while the women and children were more likely to eat the bodies of the deceased, including the brain, where the prion particles were particularly concentrated. Also, the strong possibility exists that it was passed on to women and children more easily because they took on the task of cleaning relatives after death and might have had open sores and cuts on their hands.[19]
 Although ingestion of the prion particles can lead to the disease,[25] a high degree of transmission occurred if the prion particles could reach the subcutaneous tissue. With elimination of cannibalism because of Australian colonial law enforcement and the local Christian missionaries' efforts, Alpers' research showed that kuru was already declining among the Fore by the mid‑1960s. However, the mean incubation period of the disease is 14 years, and seven cases were reported with latencies of 40 years or more for those who were most genetically resilient, continuing to appear for several more decades. Sources disagree on whether the last person with kuru died in 2005 or 2009.[9][10][7][8]
 Kuru is diagnosed by reviewing the patient's history of cerebellar signs and symptoms, performing neurological exams, and excluding other neurological diseases during exams.[15] The symptoms evaluated are typically coordination issues and involuntary muscle movements, but these markers can be confused with other diseases that affect the nervous and muscle system;  physical scans are often required to differentiate Kuru from other disorders.[26][27] There is no laboratory test to determine the presence of Kuru, except for postmortem evaluation of central nervous system (CNS) tissues, so diagnoses are achieved by eliminating other possible disorders.
 Electroencephalogram (EEG) is used to distinguish kuru from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, a similar encephalopathy (any disease that affects the structure of the brain).[27] EEGs search for electrical activity in the patient's brain and measure the frequency of each wave to determine if there is an issue with the brain's activity.[28] Periodic complexes (PC), reoccurring patterns with spike wave-complexes occurring at intervals, are recorded frequently in some diseases but are not presented in the kuru readings.[29] Exams and testing, like EEG, MRIs, blood test, and scans, can be used to determine if the infected person is dealing with Kuru disease or another encephalopathy. However, testing over periods of time can be difficult.
 In 2009, researchers at the Medical Research Council discovered a naturally occurring variant of a prion protein in a population from Papua New Guinea that confers strong resistance to kuru. In the study, which began in 1996,[30] researchers assessed over 3,000 people from the affected and surrounding Eastern Highland populations, and identified a variation in the prion protein G127.[31] G127 polymorphism is the result of a missense mutation, and is highly geographically restricted to regions where the kuru epidemic was the most widespread. Researchers believe that the PrnP variant occurred very recently, estimating that the most recent common ancestor lived 10 generations ago.[31]
 The findings of the study could help researchers better understand and develop treatments for other related prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease[30] and other neurodegenerate diseases like Alzheimer's disease.[32]
 Kuru was first described in official reports by Australian officers patrolling the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea in the early 1950s.[33] Some unofficial accounts place kuru in the region as early as 1910.[7] In 1951, Arthur Carey was the first to use the term kuru in a report to describe a new disease afflicting the Fore tribes of Papua New Guinea (PNG). In his report, Carey noted that kuru mostly affected Fore women, eventually killing them. Kuru was noted in the Fore, Yate and Usurufa people in 1952–1953 by anthropologists Ronald Berndt and Catherine Berndt.[7] In 1953, kuru was observed by patrol officer John McArthur, who provided a description of the disease in his report. McArthur believed that kuru was merely a psychosomatic episode resulting from the sorcery practices of the tribal people in the region.[33] After the disease had progressed into a larger epidemic, the tribal people asked Charles Pfarr, a Lutheran medical officer, to come to the area to report the disease to Australian authorities.[7]
 Initially, the Fore people believed the causes of kuru to be sorcery or witchcraft.[34] They also thought that the magic causing kuru was contagious. It was also called negi-nagi, which meant foolish person as the victims laughed at spontaneous intervals.[35] This disease, the Fore people believed, was caused by ghosts, because of the shaking and strange behaviour that comes with kuru. Attempting to cure this, they would feed victims casuarina bark.[36]
 When kuru disease had become an epidemic, Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, M.D., a virologist, and Vincent Zigas, another medical doctor, started research on the disease. In 1957, Zigas and Gajdusek published a report in the Medical Journal of Australia that suggested that kuru had a genetic origin, and that ""any ethnic-environmental variables that are operating in kuru pathogenesis have not yet been determined.""[37]
 Cannibalism was suspected as a possible cause from the very beginning but was not formally put forth as a hypothesis until 1967 by Glasse and more formally in 1968 by Mathews, Glasse, and Lindenbaum.[35]
 Even before anthropophagy had been linked to kuru, cannibalism was banned by the Australian administration of Papua New Guinea, and the practice was nearly eliminated by 1960. While the number of cases of kuru was decreasing, medical researchers were finally able to properly investigate kuru, which eventually led to the modern understanding of prions as its cause.[38]
 In an effort to understand the pathology of kuru disease, Gajdusek established the first experimental tests on chimpanzees for kuru at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).[7] Michael Alpers, an Australian doctor, collaborated with Gajdusek by providing samples of brain tissues he had taken from an 11-year-old Fore girl who had died of kuru.[39] In his work, Gajdusek was also the first to compile a bibliography of kuru disease.[40] Joe Gibbs joined Gajdusek to monitor and record the behavior of the apes at the NIH and conduct their autopsies. Within two years, one of the chimps, Daisy, had developed kuru, demonstrating that an unknown disease factor was transmitted through infected biomaterial and that it was capable of crossing the species barrier to other primates. After Elisabeth Beck confirmed that this experiment had brought about the first experimental transmission of kuru, the finding was deemed a very important advance in human medicine, leading to the award of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Gajdusek in 1976.[7]
 Subsequently, E. J. Field spent large parts of the late 1960s and early 1970s in New Guinea investigating the disease,[41] connecting it to scrapie and multiple sclerosis.[42] He noted the disease's interactions with glial cells, including the critical observation that the infectious process may depend on the structural rearrangement of the host's molecules.[43] This was an early observation of what was to later become the prion hypothesis.[44]

"Kuru is a rare and fatal brain disorder that occurred at epidemic levels from the 1950s to 1960s among the Fore people in the highlands of New Guinea. The disease was the result of the practice of ritualistic cannibalism among the Fore, in which relatives prepared and consumed the tissues (including brain) of deceased family members. Brain tissue from individuals with kuru was highly infectious, and the disease was transmitted either through eating or by contact with open sores or wounds. Kuru is the Fore word for shiver. Government discouragement of the practice of cannibalism led to a continuing decline in the disease, which has now mostly disappeared. Kuru belongs to a class of infectious diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), also known as prion diseases. The hallmark of a TSE disease is misshapen protein molecules that clump together and accumulate in brain tissue. Scientists believe that misshapen prion proteins have the ability to change their shape and cause other proteins of the same type to also change shape.  Other TSEs include: There were no treatments that could control or cure kuru, other than discouraging the practice of cannibalism. Currently, there are no cures or treatments for any of the other TSE diseases. Similar to other the TSEs, kuru has a long incubation period; it was years or even decades before an infected person showed symptoms. Because kuru mainly affected the cerebellum, which is responsible for coordination, the first symptoms were usually an unsteady gait, tremors, and slurred speech. Unlike most of the other TSEs, dementia was either minimal or absent. Mood changes were often present. Eventually, individuals became unable to stand or eat, and they died in a comatose state from six to 12 months after the first appearance of symptoms.

"Kuru is a rare and fatal nervous system disease that occurred mainly during the 1950s and 1960s among the Fore people in the highlands of New Guinea. The Fore people contracted the disease by performing cannibalism on corpses during funeral rituals. The name kuru means “to shiver” or “trembling in fear.”  The symptoms of the disease include muscle twitching and loss of coordination. Other symptoms include difficulty walking, involuntary movements, behavioral and mood changes, dementia, and difficulty eating. The latter can cause malnutrition. Kuru has no known cure. It’s usually fatal within one year of contraction. The identification and study of kuru helped scientific research in a number of ways. It was the first neurodegenerative disease resulting from an infectious agent. It led to the creation of a new class of diseases including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease, and fatal familial insomnia.  Today, the study of kuru still impacts research on neurodegenerative diseases. Symptoms of more common neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease or stroke may resemble kuru symptoms. These include: Kuru occurs in three stages.  It’s usually preceded by headaches and joint pain. Since these are common symptoms, they are often missed as clues that a more serious disease is underway.  First stage: A person with kuru exhibits some loss of bodily control. They may have difficulty balancing and maintaining posture.  Second stage: Also called the sedentary stage, the person is unable to walk. Body tremors and significant involuntary jerks and movements begin to occur.  Third stage: the person is usually bedridden and incontinent. They lose the ability to speak. They may also exhibit dementia or behavior changes, causing them to seem unconcerned about their health.  Starvation and malnutrition usually set in at the third stage, due to the difficulty of eating and swallowing. These secondary symptoms can lead to death within a year. Most people end up dying from pneumonia. Kuru belongs to a class of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), also called prion diseases. It primarily affects the cerebellum — the part of your brain responsible for coordination and balance.  Unlike most infections or infectious agents, kuru is not caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.  Infectious, abnormal proteins known as prions cause kuru. Prions are not living organisms and do not reproduce. They are inanimate, misshapen proteins that multiply in the brain and form clumps, hindering typical brain processes. Creutzfeldt-Jakob, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease, and fatal familial insomnia are other degenerative diseases caused by prions. These spongiform diseases, as well as kuru, create sponge-like holes in your brain and are fatal.  You can contract the disease by eating an infected brain or coming into contact with open wounds or sores of someone living with it.  Kuru developed primarily in the Fore people of New Guinea when they ate the brains of dead relatives during funeral rites. Women and children were mainly infected because they were the primary participants in these rites. The New Guinea government has discouraged the practice of cannibalism. Cases still appear, given the disease’s long incubation period, but they are rare.  Your doctor will perform a neurological exam to diagnose kuru. This is a comprehensive medical exam including: Tests such as electroencephalogram (EEG) are used to examine the electrical activity in your brain. Brain scans such as an MRI may be performed, but they may not be helpful in making a definitive diagnosis. There is no known successful treatment for kuru. Prions that cause kuru can’t be easily destroyed. Brains with prions remain infectious even when preserved in formaldehyde for years.  People with kuru require assistance to stand and move and eventually lose the ability to swallow and eat because of symptoms.  As there is no cure for it, people with it may lapse into a coma within six to 12 months after experiencing initial symptoms.  The disease is fatal and it’s best to prevent it by avoiding exposure. Kuru is exceptionally rare. It’s only contracted by ingesting infected brain tissue or coming into contact with sores containing kuru prions. Governments and societies sought to prevent the disease in the mid-20th century by discouraging the social practice of cannibalism.  According to NINDS, the disease has almost completely vanished. The incubation period of kuru — the time between initial infection and the appearance of symptoms — can be as long as 30 years. Cases have been reported long after the practice of cannibalism has ceased.  Today, kuru is rarely diagnosed. Symptoms similar to those of kuru are more likely to indicate another serious neurological disorder or spongiform disease.

  Mise en garde médicale modifier - modifier le code - voir Wikidata (aide)  Le kuru est une maladie à prions (comme la maladie de la vache folle), découverte en Nouvelle-Guinée au début du XXe siècle.
 La maladie du kuru a été décrite chez le peuple des Fore de Nouvelle-Guinée par Michael Alpers et  D. Carleton Gajdusek (prix Nobel de médecine 1976), ainsi que d'autres chercheurs. Quoique distinct de la maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob, le kuru est également une encéphalopathie spongiforme transmissible. Son mode de transmission a pu être relié à un rite funéraire anthropophage. Le mot kuru signifie « trembler de peur », en fore[1].
 Le premier cas semble avoir été décrit dans les années 1920 mais la médecine ne s’y intéresse réellement que depuis les années 1950. La maladie concerne une population aborigène de tribus fore des hauteurs de l’est de la Nouvelle-Guinée actuellement en Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guinée, qui consommait le corps des défunts lors de rites anthropophagiques mortuaires. Ce rituel consistait, pour le clan, à consommer des parents décédés afin de s’imprégner de leur force physique et spirituelle. Cette pratique semble s’être arrêtée au milieu des années 1950 sous la pression de l’administration australienne.
 Elle touchait surtout les femmes et les enfants qui mangeaient le système nerveux central. Les hommes, consommant les muscles, étaient épargnés[2],[3]. Il semble exister une susceptibilité génétique expliquant également l’atteinte spécifique de cette population. Cette maladie a été responsable de plus de la moitié des décès enregistrés dans les villages les plus atteints. Le kuru a culminé dans les années 1950, le dernier cas datant de 2003, plus de 45 ans après la contamination[4].
 Le nombre total de cas avoisine les 2 700. La maladie a disparu du fait de l’arrêt des pratiques d’anthropophagie[5].
 La période d’incubation (temps entre la contamination par le prion et les premiers signes de la maladie) peut être inférieure à 5 ans, mais l’existence d’une dizaine de cas apparue plus de 40 ans après l’arrêt supposé de tout cannibalisme soulève la question d’une période d'incubation beaucoup plus longue[6].
 La maladie se manifeste essentiellement par un syndrome cérébelleux avec un trouble de l’équilibre, de la coordination des mouvements, des troubles visuels, des crises d'épilepsie et des secousses musculaires[7]. Un tableau de démence peut compléter le tout, aboutissant au décès en quelques années.
 La maladie provoquée par l'accumulation de la protéine prion, ramollit les tissus du cerveau jusqu'à le rendre spongieux.
 En laboratoire le tacrolimus et l'astémizole ont été identifiés in vitro comme de potentiels agents antiprion utilisables chez l’être humain[8].

"Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. People who have malaria usually feel very sick with a high fever and shaking chills. While the disease is uncommon in temperate climates, malaria is still common in tropical and subtropical countries. Each year nearly 290 million people are infected with malaria, and more than 400,000 people die of the disease. To reduce malaria infections, world health programs distribute preventive drugs and insecticide-treated bed nets to protect people from mosquito bites. The World Health Organization has recommended a malaria vaccine for use in children who live in countries with high numbers of malaria cases. Protective clothing, bed nets and insecticides can protect you while traveling. You also can take preventive medicine before, during and after a trip to a high-risk area. Many malaria parasites have developed resistance to common drugs used to treat the disease. Signs and symptoms of malaria may include: Some people who have malaria experience cycles of malaria ""attacks."" An attack usually starts with shivering and chills, followed by a high fever, followed by sweating and a return to normal temperature. Malaria signs and symptoms typically begin within a few weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito. However, some types of malaria parasites can lie dormant in your body for up to a year. Talk to your doctor if you experience a fever while living in or after traveling to a high-risk malaria region. If you have severe symptoms, seek emergency medical attention. Malaria is caused by a single-celled parasite of the genus plasmodium. The parasite is transmitted to humans most commonly through mosquito bites. 
        Malaria spreads when a mosquito becomes infected with the disease after biting an infected person, and the infected mosquito then bites a noninfected person. The malaria parasites enter that person's bloodstream and travel to the liver. When the parasites mature, they leave the liver and infect red blood cells.
         Because the parasites that cause malaria affect red blood cells, people can also catch malaria from exposure to infected blood, including: The greatest risk factor for developing malaria is to live in or to visit areas where the disease is common. These include the tropical and subtropical regions of: The degree of risk depends on local malaria control, seasonal changes in malaria rates and the precautions you take to prevent mosquito bites. People at increased risk of serious disease include: In many countries with high malaria rates, the problem is worsened by lack of access to preventive measures, medical care and information. Residents of a malaria region may be exposed to the disease enough to acquire a partial immunity, which can lessen the severity of malaria symptoms. However, this partial immunity can disappear if you move to a place where you're no longer frequently exposed to the parasite. Malaria can be fatal, particularly when caused by the plasmodium species common in Africa. The World Health Organization estimates that about 94% of all malaria deaths occur in Africa — most commonly in children under the age of 5. Malaria deaths are usually related to one or more serious complications, including: Some varieties of the malaria parasite, which typically cause milder forms of the disease, can persist for years and cause relapses. If you live in or are traveling to an area where malaria is common, take steps to avoid mosquito bites. Mosquitoes are most active between dusk and dawn. To protect yourself from mosquito bites, you should: If you'll be traveling to a location where malaria is common, talk to your doctor a few months ahead of time about whether you should take drugs before, during and after your trip to help protect you from malaria parasites. In general, the drugs taken to prevent malaria are the same drugs used to treat the disease. What drug you take depends on where and how long you are traveling and your own health. The World Health Organization has recommended a malaria vaccine for use in children who live in countries with high numbers of malaria cases.

"Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects vertebrates.[6][7][3] Human malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, fatigue, vomiting, and headaches.[1][8] In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or death.[1][9] Symptoms usually begin 10 to 15 days after being bitten by an infected Anopheles mosquito.[10][4] If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.[3] In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms.[1] This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.[1]
 Human malaria is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group.[10] It is spread exclusively through bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.[10][11] The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood.[3] The parasites travel to the liver, where they mature and reproduce.[1] Five species of Plasmodium commonly infect humans.[10] The three species associated with more severe cases are P. falciparum (which is responsible for the vast majority of malaria deaths), P. vivax, and P. knowlesi (a simian malaria that spills over into thousands of people a year).[12][13] P. ovale and P. malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria.[1][10] Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests.[1] Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite's DNA have been developed, but they are not widely used in areas where malaria is common, due to their cost and complexity.[14]
 The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets and insect repellents or with mosquito-control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water.[1] Several medications are available to prevent malaria for travellers in areas where the disease is common.[3] Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria.[3] As of 2023, two malaria vaccines have been endorsed by the World Health Organization.[15] The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes artemisinin.[16][17][1][3] The second medication may be either mefloquine, lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine.[18] Quinine, along with doxycycline, may be used if artemisinin is not available.[18] In areas where the disease is common, malaria should be confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance.[3] Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.[3]
 The disease is widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions that exist in a broad band around the equator.[19][1] This includes much of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America.[3] In 2022, some 249 million cases of malaria worldwide resulted in an estimated 608,000 deaths, with 80 percent being five years old or less.[20] Around 95% of the cases and deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. Rates of disease decreased from 2010 to 2014, but increased from 2015 to 2021.[17] According to UNICEF, nearly every minute, a child under five died of malaria in 2021,[21] and ""many of these deaths are preventable and treatable"".[22] Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a significant negative effect on economic development.[23][24] In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12 billion a year due to increased healthcare costs, lost ability to work, and adverse effects on tourism.[25]
 The term malaria originates from Mediaeval Italian: mala aria 'bad air', a part of miasma theory; the disease was formerly called ague or marsh fever due to its association with swamps and marshland.[26] The term appeared in English at least as early as 1768.[27] Malaria was once common in most of Europe and North America,[28] where it is no longer endemic,[29] though imported cases do occur.[30]
 Adults with malaria tend to experience chills and fever – classically in periodic intense bouts lasting around six hours, followed by a period of sweating and fever relief – as well as headache, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and muscle pain.[32] Children tend to have more general symptoms: fever, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea.[32]
 Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms,[33] and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis, gastroenteritis, and viral diseases.[14] The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, joint pain, vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin in the urine, retinal damage, and convulsions.[34]
 The classic symptom of malaria is paroxysm—a cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by shivering and then fever and sweating, occurring every two days (tertian fever) in P. vivax and P. ovale infections, and every three days (quartan fever) for P. malariae. P. falciparum infection can cause recurrent fever every 36–48 hours, or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever.[35]
 Symptoms typically begin 10–15 days after the initial mosquito bite, but can occur as late as several months after infection with some P. vivax strains.[32] Travellers taking preventative malaria medications may develop symptoms once they stop taking the drugs.[32]
 Severe malaria is usually caused by P. falciparum (often referred to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9–30 days after infection.[33] Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms, including abnormal posturing, nystagmus, conjugate gaze palsy (failure of the eyes to turn together in the same direction), opisthotonus, seizures, or coma.[33]
 Diagnosis based on skin odor profiles
 Humans emanate a large range of smells. Studies have been conducted on how to detect human malaria infections through volatile compounds from the skin - suggesting that volatile biomarkers may be a reliable source for the detection of infection, including those asymptomatic. Using skin body odor profiles can be efficient in diagnosing global populations, and the screening and monitoring of infection to officially eradicate malaria. Research findings have predominantly relied on chemical explanations to explain the differences in attractiveness among humans based on distinct odor profiles. The existence of volatile compounds, like fatty acids, and lactic acid is an essential reason on why some individuals are more appealing to mosquitos than others.
 Volatile compounds
 Kanika Khanna, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Berkeley studying the structural basis of membrane manipulation and cell-cell fusion by bacterial pathogens, discusses studies that determine how odor profiles can be used to diagnose the disease. Within the study, samples of volatile compounds from around 400 children within schools in Western Kenya were collected - to identify asymptomatic infections. These biomarkers have been established as a non-invasive way to detect malarial infections. In addition, these volatile compounds were heavily detected by mosquito antennae as an attractant, making the children more vulnerable to the bite of the mosquitos.[36])
 Fatty acids
 Fatty acids have been identified as an attractive compound for mosquitoes, they are typically found in volatile emissions from the skin. These fatty acids that produce body odor profiles originate from the metabolism of glycerol, lactic acid, amino acids, and lipids - through the action of bacteria found within the skin. They create a “chemical signature” for the mosquitoes to locate a potential host, humans in particular.[37]
 Lactic acid
 Lactic acid, a naturally produced levorotatory isomer, has been titled an attractant of mosquitoes for a long time. Lactic acid is predominantly produced by eccrine-sweat glands, creating a large amount of sweat on the surface of the skin. Due to the high levels of lactic acid released from the human body, it has been hypothesized to represent a specific human host-recognition cue for anthropophilic (attracted to humans) mosquitoes.
 Pungent foot odor
 Most studies use human odors as stimuli to attract host seeking mosquitoes and have reported a strong and significant attractive effect. The studies have found human odor samples very effective in attracting mosquitoes. Foot odors have been demonstrated to have the highest attractiveness to anthropophilic mosquitoes. Some of these studies have included traps that had been baited with nylon socks previously worn by human participants and were deemed efficient in catching adult mosquitos. Foot odors have high numbers of volatile compounds, which in turn elicit an olfactory response from mosquitoes.[37]
 Malaria has several serious complications, including the development of respiratory distress, which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with severe P. falciparum malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, concomitant pneumonia, and severe anaemia. Although rare in young children with severe malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women.[38] Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality.[39] Kidney failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where haemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.[33]
 Infection with P. falciparum may result in cerebral malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy. It is associated with retinal whitening, which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever.[40] An enlarged spleen, enlarged liver or both of these, severe headache, low blood sugar, and haemoglobin in the urine with kidney failure may occur.[33] Complications may include spontaneous bleeding, coagulopathy, and shock.[41]
 Malaria in pregnant women is an important cause of stillbirths, infant mortality, miscarriage, and low birth weight,[42] particularly in P. falciparum infection, but also with P. vivax.[43]
 Malaria is caused by infection with parasites in the genus Plasmodium.[44] In humans, malaria is caused by six Plasmodium species: P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale curtisi, P. ovale wallikeri, P. vivax and P. knowlesi.[45] Among those infected, P. falciparum is the most common species identified (~75%) followed by P. vivax (~20%).[14] Although P. falciparum traditionally accounts for the majority of deaths,[46] recent evidence suggests that P. vivax malaria is associated with potentially life-threatening conditions about as often as with a diagnosis of P. falciparum infection.[47] P. vivax proportionally is more common outside Africa.[48] Some cases have been documented of human infections with several species of Plasmodium from higher apes, but except for P. knowlesi—a zoonotic species that causes malaria in macaques[49]—these are mostly of limited public health importance.[50]
 The Anopheles mosquitos initially get infected by Plasmodium by taking a blood meal from a previously Plasmodium infected person.[51][52] Parasites are then typically introduced by the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. Some of these inoculated parasites, called ""sporozoites"", probably remain in the skin,[53] but others travel in the bloodstream to the liver, where they invade hepatocytes.[54] They grow and divide in the liver for 2–10 days, with each infected hepatocyte eventually harboring up to 40,000 parasites.[54] The infected hepatocytes break down, releasing these invasive Plasmodium cells, called ""merozoites"", into the bloodstream. In the blood, the merozoites rapidly invade individual red blood cells, replicating over 24–72 hours to form 16–32 new merozoites.[54] The infected red blood cell lyses, and the new merozoites infect new red blood cells, resulting in a cycle that continuously amplifies the number of parasites in an infected person.[54] Over rounds of this infection cycle, a small portion of parasites do not replicate, but instead develop into early sexual stage parasites called male and female ""gametocytes"". These gametocytes develop in the bone marrow for 11 days, then return to the blood circulation to await uptake by the bite of another mosquito.[54] Once inside a mosquito, the gametocytes undergo sexual reproduction, and eventually form daughter sporozoites that migrate to the mosquito's salivary glands to be injected into a new host when the mosquito bites.[54]
 The liver infection causes no symptoms; all symptoms of malaria result from the infection of red blood cells.[45] Symptoms develop once there are more than around 100,000 parasites per milliliter of blood.[45] Many of the symptoms associated with severe malaria are caused by the tendency of P. falciparum to bind to blood vessel walls, resulting in damage to the affected vessels and surrounding tissue. Parasites sequestered in the blood vessels of the lung contribute to respiratory failure. In the brain, they contribute to coma. In the placenta they contribute to low birthweight and preterm labor, and increase the risk of abortion and stillbirth.[45] The destruction of red blood cells during infection often results in anemia, exacerbated by reduced production of new red blood cells during infection.[45]
 Only female mosquitoes feed on blood; male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar and do not transmit the disease. Females of the mosquito genus Anopheles prefer to feed at night. They usually start searching for a meal at dusk, and continue through the night until they succeed.[55] However, in Africa, due to the extensive use of bed nets, they began to bite earlier, before bed-net time.[56] Malaria parasites can also be transmitted by blood transfusions, although this is rare.[57]
 Symptoms of malaria can recur after varying symptom-free periods. Depending upon the cause, recurrence can be classified as either recrudescence, relapse, or reinfection. Recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period due to failure to remove blood-stage parasites by adequate treatment.[58] Relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from the blood but have persisted as dormant hypnozoites[59] in liver cells. Relapse commonly occurs between 8 and 24 weeks after the initial symptoms and is often seen in P. vivax and P. ovale infections.[14] P. vivax malaria cases in temperate areas often involve overwintering by hypnozoites, with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite.[60] Reinfection means that parasites were eliminated from the entire body but new parasites were then introduced. Reinfection cannot readily be distinguished from relapse and recrudescence, although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment ending is typically attributed to treatment failure.[61] People may develop some immunity when exposed to frequent infections.[62]
 Malaria infection develops via two phases: one that involves the liver (exoerythrocytic phase), and one that involves red blood cells, or erythrocytes (erythrocytic phase). When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of 8–30 days.[63]
 After a potential dormant period in the liver, these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites, which, following rupture of their host cells, escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle.[63] The parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell.[64]
 Within the red blood cells, the parasites multiply further, again asexually, periodically breaking out of their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells. Several such amplification cycles occur. Thus, classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells.[63]
 Some P. vivax sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites, but instead, produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months (7–10 months is typical) to several years.[60] After a period of dormancy, they reactivate and produce merozoites. Hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in P. vivax infections,[60] although their existence in P. ovale is uncertain.[65]
 The parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body's immune system because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen. To avoid this fate, the P. falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins on the surface of the infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen.[66] The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as those in placental malaria.[67] Sequestered red blood cells can breach the blood–brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria.[68]
 Due to the high levels of mortality and morbidity caused by malaria—especially the P. falciparum species—it has placed the greatest selective pressure on the human genome in recent history. Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and the absence of Duffy antigens on red blood cells.[69][70][71]
 The impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs that have occurred because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes a change in the haemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the modified haemoglobin S molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to distort into a curved sickle shape. In these strands, the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous (with two copies of the abnormal haemoglobin beta allele) have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anaemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavour the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.[71][72]
 Liver dysfunction as a result of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease. The syndrome is sometimes called malarial hepatitis.[73] While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.[73]
 Malaria infection affects the immune responses following vaccination for various diseases. For example, malaria suppresses immune responses to polysaccharide vaccines. A potential solution is to give curative treatment before vaccination in areas where malaria is present.[74]
 Due to the non-specific nature of malaria symptoms, diagnosis is typically suspected based on symptoms and travel history, then confirmed with a laboratory test to detect the presence of the parasite in the blood (parasitological test). In areas where malaria is common, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends clinicians suspect malaria in any person who reports having fevers, or who has a current temperature above 37.5 °C without any other obvious cause.[75] Malaria should be suspected in children with signs of anemia: pale palms or a laboratory test showing hemoglobin levels below 8 grams per deciliter of blood.[75] In areas of the world with little to no malaria, the WHO recommends only testing people with possible exposure to malaria (typically travel to a malaria-endemic area) and unexplained fever.[75]
 In sub-Saharan Africa, testing is low, with only about one in four (28%) of children with a fever receiving medical advice or a rapid diagnostic test in 2021. There was a 10-percentage point gap in testing between the richest and the poorest children (33% vs 23%). Additionally, a greater proportion of children in Eastern and Southern Africa (36%) were tested than in West and Central Africa (21%).[21] According to UNICEF, 61% of children with a fever were taken for advice or treatment from a health facility or provider in 2021. Disparities are also observed by wealth, with an 18 percentage point difference in care-seeking behaviour between children in the richest (71%) and the poorest (53%) households.[21]
 Malaria is usually confirmed by the microscopic examination of blood films or by antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). Microscopy – i.e. examining Giemsa-stained blood with a light microscope – is the gold standard for malaria diagnosis.[45] Microscopists typically examine both a ""thick film"" of blood, allowing them to scan many blood cells in a short time, and a ""thin film"" of blood, allowing them to clearly see individual parasites and identify the infecting Plasmodium species.[45] Under typical field laboratory conditions, a microscopist can detect parasites when there are at least 100 parasites per microliter of blood, which is around the lower range of symptomatic infection.[75] Microscopic diagnosis is relatively resource intensive, requiring trained personnel, specific equipment, electricity, and a consistent supply of microscopy slides and stains.[75]
 In places where microscopy is unavailable, malaria is diagnosed with RDTs, rapid antigen tests that detect parasite proteins in a fingerstick blood sample.[75] A variety of RDTs are commercially available, targeting the parasite proteins histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2, detects P. falciparum only), lactate dehydrogenase, or aldolase.[75] The HRP2 test is widely used in Africa, where P. falciparum predominates.[45] However, since HRP2 persists in the blood for up to five weeks after an infection is treated, an HRP2 test sometimes cannot distinguish whether someone currently has malaria or previously had it.[75] Additionally, some P. falciparum parasites in the Amazon region lack the HRP2 gene, complicating detection.[75] RDTs are fast and easily deployed to places without full diagnostic laboratories.[75] However they give considerably less information than microscopy, and sometimes vary in quality from producer to producer and lot to lot.[75]
 Serological tests to detect antibodies against Plasmodium from the blood have been developed, but are not used for malaria diagnosis due to their relatively poor sensitivity and specificity. Highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests have been developed, but are not used clinically due to their relatively high cost, and poor specificity for active infections.[75]
 Malaria is classified into either ""severe"" or ""uncomplicated"" by the World Health Organization (WHO).[14] It is deemed severe when any of the following criteria are present, otherwise it is considered uncomplicated.[76]
 Cerebral malaria is defined as a severe P. falciparum-malaria presenting with neurological symptoms, including coma (with a Glasgow coma scale less than 11, or a Blantyre coma scale less than 3), or with a coma that lasts longer than 30 minutes after a seizure.[77]
 Methods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites. As of 2023, there are two malaria vaccines, approved for use in children by the WHO: RTS,S and R21.[15][78] The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high Anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite eventually disappears from that area, as happened in North America, Europe, and parts of the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could re-establish if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.[79]
 Prevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the initial costs required are out of reach of many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar programme in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.[80] In 2021, the World Health Organization confirmed that China has eliminated malaria.[81] In 2023, the World Health Organization confirmed that Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Belize have eliminated malaria.[82]
 In areas where malaria is common, children under five years old often have anaemia, which is sometimes due to malaria. Giving children with anaemia in these areas preventive antimalarial medication improves red blood cell levels slightly but does not affect the risk of death or need for hospitalisation.[83]
 Vector control refers to methods used to decrease malaria by reducing the levels of transmission by mosquitoes. For individual protection, the most effective insect repellents are based on DEET or picaridin.[84] However, there is insufficient evidence that mosquito repellents can prevent malaria infection.[85] Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are effective, have been commonly used to prevent malaria, and their use has contributed significantly to the decrease in malaria in the 21st century.[86][87][88] ITNs and IRS may not be sufficient to eliminate the disease, as these interventions depend on how many people use nets, how many gaps in insecticide there are (low coverage areas), if people are not protected when outside of the home, and an increase in mosquitoes that are resistant to insecticides.[86] Modifications to people's houses to prevent mosquito exposure may be an important long term prevention measure.[86]
 Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria. Nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to find a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net.[89] Between 2000 and 2008, the use of ITNs saved the lives of an estimated 250,000 infants in Sub-Saharan Africa.[90] According to UNICEF, only 36% of households had sufficient ITNs for all household members in 2019.[91] In 2000, 1.7 million (1.8%) African children living in areas of the world where malaria is common were protected by an ITN. That number increased to 20.3 million (18.5%) African children using ITNs in 2007, leaving 89.6 million children unprotected[92] and to 68% African children using mosquito nets in 2015.[93] The percentage of children sleeping under ITNs in sub-Saharan Africa increased from less than 40% in 2011 to over 50% in 2021.[21] Most nets are impregnated with pyrethroids, a class of insecticides with low toxicity. They are most effective when used from dusk to dawn.[94] It is recommended to hang a large ""bed net"" above the center of a bed and either tuck the edges under the mattress or make sure it is large enough such that it touches the ground.[95] ITNs are beneficial towards pregnancy outcomes in malaria-endemic regions in Africa but more data is needed in Asia and Latin America.[96]
 In areas of high malaria resistance, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) combined with pyrethroids in mosquito netting is effective in reducing malaria infection rates.[97]  Questions remain concerning the durability of PBO on nets as the impact on mosquito mortality was not sustained after twenty washes in experimental trials.[97]
 UNICEF notes that the use of insecticide-treated nets has been increased since 2000 through accelerated production, procurement and delivery, stating that ""over 2.5 billion ITNs have been distributed globally since 2004, with 87% (2.2 billion) distributed in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2021, manufacturers delivered about 220 million ITNs to malaria endemic countries, a decrease of 9 million ITNs compared with 2020 and 33 million less than were delivered in 2019"".[22] As of 2021, 66% of households in sub-Saharan Africa had ITNs, with figures ""ranging from 31 per cent in Angola in 2016 to approximately 97 per cent in Guinea-Bissau in 2019"".[22] Slightly more than half of the households with an ITN had enough of them to protect all members of the household, however.[22]
 Indoor residual spraying is the spraying of insecticides on the walls inside a home. After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite.[98] As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin.[99] This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use.[100] One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance. Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors, and due to the irritation caused by spraying, their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors, meaning that they are less affected by the IRS.[101] Communities using insecticide treated nets, in addition to indoor residual spraying with 'non-pyrethroid-like' insecticides found associated reductions in malaria.[102]  Additionally, the use of 'pyrethroid-like' insecticides in addition to indoor residual spraying did not result in a detectable additional benefit in communities using insecticide treated nets.[102]
 Housing is a risk factor for malaria and modifying the house as a prevention measure may be a sustainable strategy that does not rely on the effectiveness of insecticides such as pyrethroids.[86][103] The physical environment inside and outside the home that may improve the density of mosquitoes are considerations. Examples of potential modifications include how close the home is to mosquito breeding sites, drainage and water supply near the home, availability of mosquito resting sites (vegetation around the home), the proximity to live stock and domestic animals, and physical improvements or modifications to the design of the home to prevent mosquitoes from entering,[86] such as window screens.
 Mass drug administration (MDA) involves the administration of drugs to the entire population of an area regardless of disease status.[104] A 2021 Cochrane review on the use of community administration of ivermectin found that, to date, low quality evidence shows no significant impact on reducing incidence of malaria transmission from the community administration of ivermectin.[105]
 People have tried a number of other methods to reduce mosquito bites and slow the spread of malaria. Efforts to decrease mosquito larvae by decreasing the availability of open water where they develop, or by adding substances to decrease their development, are effective in some locations.[106] Electronic mosquito repellent devices, which make very high-frequency sounds that are supposed to keep female mosquitoes away, have no supporting evidence of effectiveness.[107] There is a low certainty evidence that fogging may have an effect on malaria transmission.[108] Larviciding by hand delivery of chemical or microbial insecticides into water bodies containing low larval distribution may reduce malarial transmission.[109] There is insufficient evidence to determine whether larvivorous fish can decrease mosquito density and transmission in the area.[110]
 There are a number of medications that can help prevent or interrupt malaria in travellers to places where infection is common. Many of these medications are also used in treatment. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine, doxycycline, or the combination of atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone)—are frequently used for prevention.[111] Doxycycline and the atovaquone/proguanil are better tolerated while mefloquine is taken once a week.[111] Areas of the world with chloroquine-sensitive malaria are uncommon.[112] Antimalarial mass drug administration to an entire population at the same time may reduce the risk of contracting malaria in the population, however the effectiveness of mass drug administration may vary depending on the prevalence of malaria in the area.[113] Other factors such as drug administration plus other protective measures such as mosquito control, the proportion of people treated in the area, and the risk of reinfection with malaria may play a role in the effectiveness of mass drug treatment approaches.[113]
 The protective effect does not begin immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before they arrive, and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward).[114] The use of preventive drugs is often not practical for those who live in areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually given only to pregnant women and short-term visitors. This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining antimalarial drugs outside of wealthy nations.[115] During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anaemia in the mother.[116] The use of preventive drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance.[117]
 Giving antimalarial drugs to infants through intermittent preventive therapy can reduce the risk of having malaria infection, hospital admission, and anaemia.[118]
 Mefloquine is more effective than sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in preventing malaria for HIV-negative pregnant women. Cotrimoxazole is effective in preventing malaria infection and reduce the risk of getting anaemia in HIV-positive women.[119] Giving sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for three or more doses as intermittent preventive therapy is superior than two doses for HIV-positive women living in malaria-endemic areas.[120]
 Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) may also reduce transmission.[121]
 Malaria vaccines have been another goal of research. The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunising mice with live, radiation-attenuated sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites. Since the 1970s, there has been considerable progress in developing similar vaccination strategies for humans.[122]
 In 2013, WHO and the malaria vaccine funders group set a goal to develop vaccines designed to interrupt malaria transmission with malaria eradication's long-term goal.[123] The first vaccine, called RTS,S, was approved by European regulators in 2015.[124] As of 2023, two malaria vaccines have been licensed for use.[15] Other approaches to combat malaria may require investing more in research and greater primary health care.[125] Continuing surveillance will also be important to prevent the return of malaria in countries where the disease has been eliminated.[126]
 As of 2019 it is undergoing pilot trials in 3 sub-Saharan African countries – Ghana, Kenya and Malawi – as part of the WHO's Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP).[127]
 Immunity (or, more accurately, tolerance) to P. falciparum malaria does occur naturally, but only in response to years of repeated infection.[62][128] An individual can be protected from a P. falciparum infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry a version of the parasite rendered non-infective by a dose of X-ray irradiation.[129] The highly polymorphic nature of many P. falciparum proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito.[130] Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own.[131] For example, SPf66 was tested extensively in areas where the disease was common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.[132]
 As of 2020, the RTS,S vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of malaria by about 40% in children in Africa.[78][133] A preprint study of the R21 vaccine has shown 77% vaccine efficacy.[needs update][134]
 In 2021, researchers from the University of Oxford reported findings from a Phase IIb trial of a candidate malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, which demonstrated efficacy of 77% over 12-months of follow-up. This vaccine is the first to meet the World Health Organization's Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap goal of a vaccine with at least 75% efficacy.[135]
 Germany-based BioNTECH SE are developing an mRNA-based malaria vaccine BN165 [136] which has recently initiated a Phase 1 study [clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT05581641] in December 2022. The vaccine, based on the circumsporozite protein (CSP) is being tested in adults aged 18–55 yrs at 3 dose levels to select a safe and tolerable dose of a 3-dose schedule. Unlike GSK's RTS,S (AS01) and Serum Institute of India's R21/MatrixM, BNT-165 is being studied in adult age groups meaning it could be developed for Western travelers as well as those living in endemic countries. For the travelers profile, a recent commercial assessment forecast potential gross revenues of BNT-165 at $479m (2030) 5-yrs post launch, POS-adjusted revenues.[137]
 Community participation and health education strategies promoting awareness of malaria and the importance of control measures have been successfully used to reduce the incidence of malaria in some areas of the developing world.[138] Recognising the disease in the early stages can prevent it from becoming fatal. Education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant, still water, such as water tanks that are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito, thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people. This is generally used in urban areas where there are large centers of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas.[139] Intermittent preventive therapy is another intervention that has been used successfully to control malaria in pregnant women and infants,[140] and in preschool children where transmission is seasonal.[141]
 Malaria is treated with antimalarial medications; the ones used depends on the type and severity of the disease.[142] While medications against fever are commonly used, their effects on outcomes are not clear.[143][144] Providing free antimalarial drugs to households may reduce childhood deaths when used appropriately. Programmes which presumptively treat all causes of fever with antimalarial drugs may lead to overuse of antimalarials and undertreat other causes of fever. Nevertheless, the use of malaria rapid-diagnostic kits can help to reduce over-usage of antimalarials.[145][146]
 Simple or uncomplicated malaria may be treated with oral medications. Artemisinin drugs are effective and safe in treating uncomplicated malaria.[147] Artemisinin in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT) is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria.[90] The most effective treatment for P. falciparum infection is the use of ACT, which decreases resistance to any single drug component.[148][149] Artemether-lumefantrine (six-dose regimen) is more effective than the artemether-lumefantrine (four-dose regimen) or other regimens not containing artemisinin derivatives in treating falciparum malaria.[150][151] Another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine.[152][153][154] Artemisinin-naphthoquine combination therapy showed promising results in treating falciparum malaria but more research is needed to establish its efficacy as a reliable treatment.[155] Artesunate plus mefloquine performs better than mefloquine alone in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in low transmission settings.[156] Atovaquone-proguanil is effective against uncomplicated falciparum with a possible failure rate of 5% to 10%; the addition of artesunate may reduce failure rate.[157] Azithromycin monotherapy or combination therapy has not shown effectiveness in treating Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria.[158] Amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine may achieve less treatment failures when compared to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone in uncomplicated falciparum malaria.[159] There is insufficient data on chlorproguanil-dapsone in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria.[160][161] The addition of primaquine with artemisinin-based combination therapy for falciparum malaria reduces its transmission at day 3-4 and day 8 of infection.[162] Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate is better than sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine in controlling treatment failure at day 28. However, the latter is better than the former in reducing gametocytes in blood at day 7.[163]
 Infection with P. vivax, P. ovale or P. malariae usually does not require hospitalisation. Treatment of P. vivax malaria requires both elimination of the parasite in the blood with chloroquine or with artemisinin-based combination therapy and clearance of parasites from the liver with an 8-aminoquinoline agent such as primaquine or tafenoquine.[164][165] These two drugs act against blood stages as well, the extent to which they do so still being under investigation.[166]
 To treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy (1st trimester), and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters).[167][168] There is limited safety data on the antimalarial drugs in pregnancy.[169]
 Cases of severe and complicated malaria are almost always caused by infection with P. falciparum. The other species usually cause only febrile disease.[170] Severe and complicated malaria cases are medical emergencies since mortality rates are high (10% to 50%).[171]
 Recommended treatment for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate was superior to quinine in both children and adults.[172][173] In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine in the treatment of cerebral malaria in children.[174] Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.[46] Artemisinin derivatives have the same or better efficacy than quinolones in preventing deaths in severe or complicated malaria.[175] Quinine loading dose helps to shorten the duration of fever and increases parasite clearance from the body.[176] There is no difference in effectiveness when using intrarectal quinine compared to intravenous or intramuscular quinine in treating uncomplicated/complicated falciparum malaria.[177] There is insufficient evidence for intramuscular arteether to treat severe malaria.[178] The provision of rectal artesunate before transfer to hospital may reduce the rate of death for children with severe malaria.[179] In children with malaria and concomitant hypoglycaemia, sublingual administration of glucose appears to result in better increases in blood sugar after 20 minutes when compared to oral administration, based on very limited data.[180]
 Cerebral malaria is the form of severe and complicated malaria with the worst neurological symptoms.[181] There is insufficient data on whether osmotic agents such as mannitol or urea are effective in treating cerebral malaria.[182] Routine phenobarbitone in cerebral malaria is associated with fewer convulsions but possibly more deaths.[183] There is no evidence that steroids would bring treatment benefits for cerebral malaria.[184]
 Managing cerebral malaria
Cerebral malaria usually makes a patient comatose. If the cause of the coma is in doubt, testing for other locally prevalent causes of encephalopathy (bacterial, viral or fungal infection) should be carried out. In areas where there is a high prevalence of malaria infection (e.g. tropical region) treatment can start without testing first.[44] To manage the cerebral malaria when confirmed the following can be done:
 There is insufficient evidence to show that blood transfusion is useful in either reducing deaths for children with severe anaemia or in improving their haematocrit in one month.[186] There is insufficient evidence that iron chelating agents such as deferoxamine and deferiprone improve outcomes of those with malaria falciparum infection.[187]
 A 2022 clinical trial shows that a monoclonal antibody mAb L9LS offers protection against malaria. It binds the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP-1), essential to disease, and makes it ineffective.[188]
 Drug resistance poses a growing problem in 21st-century malaria treatment.[189] In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia.[190][191] Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins. Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs. The cost of artemisinins limits their use in the developing world.[192] Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable.[193] Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years and the availability of substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype.[194] Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam,[195] and there has been emerging resistance in Laos.[196][197] Resistance to the combination of artemisinin and piperaquine was first detected in 2013 in Cambodia, and by 2019 had spread across Cambodia and into Laos, Thailand and Vietnam (with up to 80 percent of malaria parasites resistant in some regions).[198]
 There is insufficient evidence in unit packaged antimalarial drugs in preventing treatment failures of malaria infection. However, if supported by training of healthcare providers and patient information, there is improvement in compliance of those receiving treatment.[199]
 When properly treated, people with malaria can usually expect a complete recovery.[200] However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days.[201] In the most severe cases of the disease, fatality rates can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment.[14] Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children who have had episodes of severe malaria.[202] Chronic infection without severe disease can occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to Salmonella bacteria and the Epstein–Barr virus.[203]
 During childhood, malaria causes anaemia during a period of rapid brain development, and also direct brain damage resulting from cerebral malaria.[202] Some survivors of cerebral malaria have an increased risk of neurological and cognitive deficits, behavioural disorders, and epilepsy.[204] Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups.[202]
 The WHO estimates that in 2021 there were 247 million total cases of malaria resulting in 619,000 deaths.[17] Children under five years old are the most affected, accounting for 67% of malaria deaths worldwide in 2019.[206] About 125 million pregnant women are at risk of infection each year; in Sub-Saharan Africa, maternal malaria is associated with up to 200,000 estimated infant deaths yearly.[42] Since 2015, the WHO European Region has been free of malaria. The last country to report an indigenous malaria case was Tajikistan in 2014.[17] There are about 1300–1500 malaria cases per year in the United States.[38] The United States eradicated malaria as a major public health concern in 1951,[207] though small outbreaks persist.[208] Locally acquired mosquito-borne malaria occurred in the United States in 2003, when eight cases of locally acquired P. vivax malaria were identified in Florida, and again in May 2023, in four cases, as well as one case in Texas,[209] and in August in one case in Maryland.[210] About 900 people died from the disease in Europe between 1993 and 2003.[84] Both the global incidence of disease and resulting mortality have declined in recent years. According to the WHO and UNICEF, deaths attributable to malaria in 2015 were reduced by 60%[93] from a 2000 estimate of 985,000, largely due to the widespread use of insecticide-treated nets and artemisinin-based combination therapies.[90] Between 2000 and 2019, malaria mortality rates among all ages halved from about 30 to 13 per 100,000 population at risk. During this period, malaria deaths among children under five also declined by nearly half (47%) from 781,000 in 2000 to 416,000 in 2019.[91]
 Malaria is presently endemic in a broad band around the equator, in areas of the Americas, many parts of Asia, and much of Africa; in Sub-Saharan Africa, 85–90% of malaria fatalities occur.[211] An estimate for 2009 reported that countries with the highest death rate per 100,000 of population were Ivory Coast (86.15), Angola (56.93) and Burkina Faso (50.66).[212] A 2010 estimate indicated the deadliest countries per population were Burkina Faso, Mozambique and Mali.[213] The Malaria Atlas Project aims to map global levels of malaria, providing a way to determine the global spatial limits of the disease and to assess disease burden.[214][215] This effort led to the publication of a map of P. falciparum endemicity in 2010 and an update in 2019.[216][217][218] As of 2021, 84 countries have endemic malaria.[17]
 The geographic distribution of malaria within large regions is complex, and malaria-afflicted and malaria-free areas are often found close to each other.[219] Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions because of rainfall, consistent high temperatures and high humidity, along with stagnant waters where mosquito larvae readily mature, providing them with the environment they need for continuous breeding.[220] In drier areas, outbreaks of malaria have been predicted with reasonable accuracy by mapping rainfall.[221] Malaria is more common in rural areas than in cities. For example, several cities in the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia are essentially malaria-free, but the disease is prevalent in many rural regions, including along international borders and forest fringes.[222] In contrast, malaria in Africa is present in both rural and urban areas, though the risk is lower in the larger cities.[223]
 Climate change is likely to affect malaria transmission, but the degree of effect and the areas affected is uncertain.[224] Greater rainfall in certain areas of India, and following an El Niño event is associated with increased mosquito numbers.[225]
 Since 1900 there has been substantial change in temperature and rainfall over Africa.[226] However, factors that contribute to how rainfall results in water for mosquito breeding are complex, incorporating the extent to which it is absorbed into soil and vegetation for example, or rates of runoff and evaporation.[227] Recent research has provided a more in-depth picture of conditions across Africa, combining a malaria climatic suitability model with a continental-scale model representing real-world hydrological processes.[227]
 Although the parasite responsible for P. falciparum malaria has been in existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of the parasite did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture[228] and the development of human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the P. falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.[229]
 References to the unique periodic fevers of malaria are found throughout history.[230] Hippocrates described periodic fevers, labelling them tertian, quartan, subtertian and quotidian.[231] The Roman Columella associated the disease with insects from swamps.[231] Malaria may have contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire,[232] and was so pervasive in Rome that it was known as the ""Roman fever"".[233] Several regions in ancient Rome were considered at-risk for the disease because of the favourable conditions present for malaria vectors. This included areas such as southern Italy, the island of Sardinia, the Pontine Marshes, the lower regions of coastal Etruria and the city of Rome along the Tiber. The presence of stagnant water in these places was preferred by mosquitoes for breeding grounds. Irrigated gardens, swamp-like grounds, run-off from agriculture, and drainage problems from road construction led to the increase of standing water.[234]
 Malaria is not referenced in the medical books of the Mayans or Aztecs. Despite this, antibodies against malaria have been detected in some South American mummies, indicating that some malaria strains in the Americas might have a pre-Columbian origin.[235] European settlers and the West Africans they enslaved likely brought malaria to the Americas starting in the 16th century.[236][237]
 Scientific studies on malaria made their first significant advance in 1880, when Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran—a French army doctor working in the military hospital of Constantine in Algeria—observed parasites inside the red blood cells of infected people for the first time.[238] He, therefore, proposed that malaria is caused by this organism, the first time a protist was identified as causing disease.[239] For this and later discoveries, he was awarded the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. A year later, Carlos Finlay, a Cuban doctor treating people with yellow fever in Havana, provided strong evidence that mosquitoes were transmitting disease to and from humans.[240] This work followed earlier suggestions by Josiah C. Nott,[241] and work by Sir Patrick Manson, the ""father of tropical medicine"", on the transmission of filariasis.[242]
 In April 1894, a Scottish physician, Sir Ronald Ross, visited Sir Patrick Manson at his house on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit was the start of four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1897 when Ross, who was working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta, proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes.[243] He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds.[243] For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius.[244] The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by William C. Gorgas in the health measures undertaken during construction of the Panama Canal. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.[245]
 In 1896, Amico Bignami discussed the role of mosquitoes in malaria.[246] In 1898, Bignami, Giovanni Battista Grassi and Giuseppe Bastianelli succeeded in showing experimentally the transmission of malaria in humans, using infected mosquitoes to contract malaria themselves which they presented in November 1898 to the Accademia dei Lincei.[243]
 The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. This tree grows on the slopes of the Andes, mainly in Peru. The indigenous peoples of Peru made a tincture of cinchona to control fever. Its effectiveness against malaria was found and the Jesuits introduced the treatment to Europe around 1640; by 1677, it was included in the London Pharmacopoeia as an antimalarial treatment.[247] It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient, quinine, was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by the French chemists Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou.[248][249]
 Quinine was the predominant malarial medication until the 1920s when other medications began to appear. In the 1940s, chloroquine replaced quinine as the treatment of both uncomplicated and severe malaria until resistance supervened, first in Southeast Asia and South America in the 1950s and then globally in the 1980s.[250]
 The medicinal value of Artemisia annua has been used by Chinese herbalists in traditional Chinese medicines for 2,000 years.[251][252] In 1596, Li Shizhen recommended tea made from qinghao specifically to treat malaria symptoms in his ""Compendium of Materia Medica"", however the efficacy of tea, made with A. annua, for the treatment of malaria is dubious, and is discouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO).[253][254] Artemisinins, discovered by Chinese scientist Tu Youyou and colleagues in the 1970s from the plant Artemisia annua, became the recommended treatment for P. falciparum malaria, administered in severe cases in combination with other antimalarials.[255] Tu says she was influenced by a traditional Chinese herbal medicine source, The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments, written in 340 by Ge Hong.[256] For her work on malaria, Tu Youyou received the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[257]
 Plasmodium vivax was used between 1917 and the 1940s for malariotherapy—deliberate injection of malaria parasites to induce a fever to combat certain diseases such as tertiary syphilis. In 1927, the inventor of this technique, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries. The technique was dangerous, killing about 15% of patients, so it is no longer in use.[258]
 The first pesticide used for indoor residual spraying was DDT.[259] Although it was initially used exclusively to combat malaria, its use quickly spread to agriculture. In time, pest control, rather than disease control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use led to the evolution of pesticide-resistant mosquitoes in many regions. The DDT resistance shown by Anopheles mosquitoes can be compared to antibiotic resistance shown by bacteria. During the 1960s, awareness of the negative consequences of its indiscriminate use increased, ultimately leading to bans on agricultural applications of DDT in many countries in the 1970s.[100] Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larval stages, for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound Paris Green to places with standing water.[260]
 Various types of malaria have been called by the names below:[261]
 Malaria has been successfully eliminated or significantly reduced in certain areas, but not globally. Malaria was once common in the United States, but the US eliminated malaria from most parts of the country in the early 20th century using vector control programs, which combined the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings.[262]  The use of the pesticide DDT and other means eliminated malaria from the remaining pockets in southern states of the US the 1950s, as part of the National Malaria Eradication Program.[263]  Most of Europe, North America, Australia, North Africa and the Caribbean, and parts of South America, Asia and Southern Africa have also eliminated malaria.[264] The WHO defines ""elimination"" (or ""malaria-free"") as having no domestic transmission (indigenous cases) for the past three years. They also define ""pre-elimination"" and ""elimination"" stages when a country has fewer than 5 or 1, respectively, cases per 1000 people at risk per year. In 2021, the total of international and national funding for malaria control and elimination was $3.5 billion – only half of what is estimated to be needed.[21] According to UNICEF, to achieve the goal of a malaria-free world, annual funding would need to more than double to reach the US$6.8 billion target.[21]
 In parts of the world with rising living standards, the elimination of malaria was often a collateral benefit of the introduction of window screens and improved sanitation.[265] A variety of usually simultaneous interventions represents best practice. These include antimalarial drugs to prevent or treat infection; improvements in public health infrastructure to diagnose, sequester and treat infected individuals; bednets and other methods intended to keep mosquitoes from biting humans; and vector control strategies[266] such as larvaciding with insecticides, ecological controls such as draining mosquito breeding grounds or introducing fish to eat larvae and indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides.
 In 1955 the WHO launched the Global Malaria Eradication Program (GMEP).[267] The program relied largely on DDT for mosquito control and rapid diagnosis and treatment to break the transmission cycle.[268] The program eliminated the disease in ""North America, Europe, the former Soviet Union"",[269] and in ""Taiwan, much of the Caribbean, the Balkans, parts of northern Africa, the northern region of Australia, and a large swath of the South Pacific""[265] and dramatically reduced mortality in Sri Lanka and India.[270]
 However, failure to sustain the program, increasing mosquito tolerance to DDT, and increasing parasite tolerance led to a resurgence. In many areas early successes partially or completely reversed, and in some cases rates of transmission increased.[271] Experts tie malarial resurgence to multiple factors, including poor leadership, management and funding of malaria control programs; poverty; civil unrest; and increased irrigation. The evolution of resistance to first-generation drugs (e.g. chloroquine) and to insecticides exacerbated the situation.[272][273] The program succeeded in eliminating malaria only in areas with ""high socio-economic status, well-organized healthcare systems, and relatively less intensive or seasonal malaria transmission"".[269]
 For example, in Sri Lanka, the program reduced cases from about one million per year before spraying to just 18 in 1963[274][275] and 29 in 1964. Thereafter the program was halted to save money and malaria rebounded to 600,000 cases in 1968 and the first quarter of 1969. The country resumed DDT vector control but the mosquitoes had evolved resistance in the interim, presumably because of continued agricultural use. The program switched to malathion, but despite initial successes, malaria continued its resurgence into the 1980s.[270][276]
 Due to vector and parasite resistance and other factors, the feasibility of eradicating malaria with the strategy used at the time and resources available led to waning support for the program.[277] WHO suspended the program in 1969[267][277] and attention instead focused on controlling and treating the disease. Spraying programs (especially using DDT) were curtailed due to concerns over safety and environmental effects, as well as problems in administrative, managerial and financial implementation.[271] Efforts shifted from spraying to the use of bednets impregnated with insecticides and other interventions.[269][278]
 Target 6C of the Millennium Development Goals included reversal of the global increase in malaria incidence by 2015, with specific targets for children under five years old.[279]  Since 2000, support for malaria eradication increased, although some actors in the global health community (including voices within the WHO) view malaria eradication as a premature goal and suggest that the establishment of strict deadlines for malaria eradication may be counterproductive as they are likely to be missed.[280] One of the targets of Goal 3 of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals is to end the malaria epidemic in all countries by 2030.
 In 2006, the organization Malaria No More set a public goal of eliminating malaria from Africa by 2015, and the organization claimed they planned to dissolve if that goal was accomplished. In 2007, World Malaria Day was established by the 60th session of the World Health Assembly. As of 2018, they are still functioning.[281]
 As of 2012[update], The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria has distributed 230 million insecticide-treated nets intended to stop mosquito-borne transmission of malaria.[282] The U.S.-based Clinton Foundation has worked to manage demand and stabilize prices in the artemisinin market.[283] Other efforts, such as the Malaria Atlas Project, focus on analysing climate and weather information required to accurately predict malaria spread based on the availability of habitat of malaria-carrying parasites.[214] The Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) was formed in 2012, ""to provide strategic advice and technical input to WHO on all aspects of malaria control and elimination"".[284]
 In 2015 the WHO targeted a 90% reduction in malaria deaths by 2030,[285] and Bill Gates said in 2016 that he thought global eradication would be possible by 2040.[286] According to the WHO's World Malaria Report 2015, the global mortality rate for malaria fell by 60% between 2000 and 2015. The WHO targeted a further 90% reduction between 2015 and 2030,[287] with a 40% reduction and eradication in 10 countries by 2020.[288] However, the 2020 goal was missed with a slight increase in cases compared to 2015.[289] Additionally, UNICEF reported that the number of malaria deaths for all ages increased by 10% between 2019 and 2020, in part due to service disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, before experiencing a minor decline in 2021.[21]
 Before 2016, the Global Fund against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria had provided 659 million ITN (insecticide treated bed nets), organise support and education to prevents malaria. The challenges are high due to the lack of funds, the fragile health structure and the remote indigenous population that could be hard to reach and educate. Most of indigenous population rely on self-diagnosis, self-treatment, healer, and traditional medicine. The WHO applied for fund to the Gates Foundation which favour the action of malaria eradication in 2007.[290] Six countries, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Armenia, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Sri Lanka managed to have no endemic cases of  malaria for three consecutive years and certified malaria-free by the WHO despite the stagnation of the funding in 2010.[279] The funding is essential to finance the cost of medication and hospitalisation cannot be supported by the poor countries where the disease is widely spread. The goal of eradication has not been met; nevertheless, the decrease rate of the disease is considerable.
 While 31 out of 92 endemic countries were estimated to be on track with the WHO goals for 2020, 15 countries reported an increase of 40% or more between 2015 and 2020.[289] Between 2000 and 30 June 2021, twelve countries were certified by the WHO as being malaria-free.  Argentina and Algeria were declared free of malaria in 2019.[289][291] El Salvador and China were declared malaria-free in the first half of 2021.[292][293]
 Regional disparities were evident: Southeast Asia was on track to meet WHO's 2020 goals, while Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean and West Pacific regions were off-track.[289]  The six Greater Mekong Subregion countries aim for elimination of P. falciparum transmitted malaria by 2025 and elimination of all malaria by 2030, having achieved a 97% and 90% reduction of cases respectively since 2000.[289] Ahead of World Malaria Day, 25 April 2021, WHO named 25 countries in which it is working to eliminate malaria by 2025 as part of its E-2025 initiative.[294]
 A major challenge to malaria elimination is the persistence of malaria in border regions, making international cooperation crucial.[295]
 In 2018, WHO announced that Paraguay was free of malaria, after a national malaria eradication effort that began in 1950.[296]
 In March 2023, the WHO certified Azerbaijan and Tajikistan as malaria-free,[297] and Belize in June 2023.[298]  Cabo Verde, the latest country to eradicate Malaria, was certified in January 2024, bringing the total number of countries and territories certified malaria-free to 44.[299]
 Malaria is not just a disease commonly associated with poverty; some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development.[23][24] Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was a major factor in the slow economic development of the American southern states.[300]
 A comparison of average per capita GDP in 1995, adjusted for parity of purchasing power, between countries with malaria and countries without malaria gives a fivefold difference (US$1,526 versus US$8,268). In the period 1965 to 1990, countries where malaria was common had an average per capita GDP that increased only 0.4% per year, compared to 2.4% per year in other countries.[301]
 Poverty can increase the risk of malaria since those in poverty do not have the financial capacities to prevent or treat the disease. In its entirety, the economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa US$12 billion every year. The economic impact includes costs of health care, working days lost due to sickness, days lost in education, decreased productivity due to brain damage from cerebral malaria, and loss of investment and tourism.[25] The disease has a heavy burden in some countries, where it may be responsible for 30–50% of hospital admissions, up to 50% of outpatient visits, and up to 40% of public health spending.[302]
 Cerebral malaria is one of the leading causes of neurological disabilities in African children.[204] Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery.[202] Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching socioeconomic consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.[303]
 Sophisticated counterfeits have been found in several Asian countries such as Cambodia,[304] China,[305] Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, and are a major cause of avoidable death in those countries.[306] The WHO said that studies indicate that up to 40% of artesunate-based malaria medications are counterfeit, especially in the Greater Mekong region. They have established a rapid alert system to rapidly report information about counterfeit drugs to relevant authorities in participating countries.[307] There is no reliable way for doctors or lay people to detect counterfeit drugs without help from a laboratory. Companies are attempting to combat the persistence of counterfeit drugs by using new technology to provide security from source to distribution.[308]
 Another clinical and public health concern is the proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from inappropriate concentration of ingredients, contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities, poor quality ingredients, poor stability and inadequate packaging.[309] A 2012 study demonstrated that roughly one-third of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis, packaging analysis, or were falsified.[310]
 Throughout history, the contraction of malaria has played a prominent role in the fates of government rulers, nation-states, military personnel, and military actions.[311] In 1910, Nobel Prize in Medicine-winner Ronald Ross (himself a malaria survivor), published a book titled The Prevention of Malaria that included a chapter titled ""The Prevention of Malaria in War"". The chapter's author, Colonel C. H. Melville, Professor of Hygiene at Royal Army Medical College in London, addressed the prominent role that malaria has historically played during wars: ""The history of malaria in war might almost be taken to be the history of war itself, certainly the history of war in the Christian era. ... It is probably the case that many of the so-called camp fevers, and probably also a considerable proportion of the camp dysentery, of the wars of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were malarial in origin.""[312] In British-occupied India the cocktail gin and tonic may have come about as a way of taking quinine, known for its antimalarial properties.[313]
 Malaria was the most significant health hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during World War II, where about 500,000 men were infected.[314] According to Joseph Patrick Byrne, ""Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the African and South Pacific campaigns.""[315]
 Significant financial investments have been made to procure existing and create new antimalarial agents. During World War I and World War II, inconsistent supplies of the natural antimalaria drugs cinchona bark and quinine prompted substantial funding into research and development of other drugs and vaccines. American military organisations conducting such research initiatives include the Navy Medical Research Center, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases of the US Armed Forces.[316]
 Additionally, initiatives have been founded such as Malaria Control in War Areas (MCWA), established in 1942, and its successor, the Communicable Disease Center (now known as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC) established in 1946. According to the CDC, MCWA ""was established to control malaria around military training bases in the southern United States and its territories, where malaria was still problematic"".[317]
 The Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) initiative was a consultative process to identify which areas of research and development (R&D) must be addressed for worldwide eradication of malaria.[318][319]
 Malaria parasites contain apicoplasts, organelles related to the plastids found in plants, complete with their own genomes. These apicoplasts are thought to have originated through the endosymbiosis of algae and play a crucial role in various aspects of parasite metabolism, such as fatty acid biosynthesis. Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel antimalarial drugs.[320]
 With the onset of drug-resistant Plasmodium parasites, new strategies are being developed to combat the widespread disease. One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic pyridoxal-amino acid adducts, which are taken up by the parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential B vitamins.[321][322] Antimalarial drugs using synthetic metal-based complexes are attracting research interest.[323][324]
 On the basis of molecular docking outcomes, compounds 3j, 4b, 4h, 4m were exhibited selectivity towards PfLDH. The post docking analysis displayed stable dynamic behavior of all the selected compounds compared to Chloroquine. The end state thermodynamics analysis stated 3j compound as a selective and potent PfLDH inhibitor.[326]
 Targeting Plasmodium liver-stage parasites selectively is emerging as an alternative strategy in the face of resistance to the latest frontline combination therapies against blood stages of the parasite.[327]
 In research conducted in 2019, using experimental analysis with knockout (KO) mutants of Plasmodium berghei, the authors were able to identify genes that are potentially essential in the liver stage. Moreover, they generated a computational model to analyse pre–erytrocytic development and liver–stage metabolism. Combining both methods they identified seven metabolic subsystems that become essential compared to the blood stage. Some of these metabolic pathways are fatty acid synthesis and elongation, tricarboxylic acid, amino acid and heme metabolism among others.[327]
 Specifically, they studied 3 subsystems: fatty acid synthesis and elongation, and amino sugar biosynthesis. For the first two pathways they demonstrated a clear dependence of the liver stage on its own fatty acid metabolism.[327]
 They proved for the first time the critical role of amino sugar biosynthesis in the liver stage of P. berghei. The uptake of N–acetyl–glucosamine appears to be limited in the liver stage, being its synthesis needed for the parasite development.[327]
 These findings and the computational model provide a basis for the design of antimalarial therapies targeting metabolic proteins.[327][328]
 A non-chemical vector control strategy involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in genetic engineering technologies make it possible to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.[89]
 Genomics is central to malaria research. With the sequencing of P. falciparum, one of its vectors Anopheles gambiae, and the human genome, the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria life cycle can be studied.[329] Another new application of genetic technology is the ability to produce genetically modified mosquitoes that do not transmit malaria, potentially allowing biological control of malaria transmission.[330]
 In one study, a genetically modified strain of Anopheles stephensi was created that no longer supported malaria transmission, and this resistance was passed down to mosquito offspring.[331]
 Gene drive is a technique for changing wild populations, for instance to combat or eliminate insects so they cannot transmit diseases (in particular mosquitoes in the cases of malaria,[332] zika,[333] dengue and yellow fever).[285]
 In a study conducted in 2015, researchers observed a specific interaction between malaria and co-infection with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a pulmonary migrating helminth, in mice.[334]  The co-infection was found to reduce the virulence of the Plasmodium parasite, the causative agent of malaria. This reduction was attributed to the nematode infection causing increased destruction of erythrocytes, or red blood cells. Given that Plasmodium has a predilection for older host erythrocytes, the increased erythrocyte destruction and ensuing erythropoiesis result in a predominantly younger erythrocyte population, which in turn leads to a decrease in Plasmodium population.[334] Notably, this effect appears to be largely independent of the host's immune control of Plasmodium.
 Finally, a review article published in December 2020 noted a correlation between malaria-endemic regions and COVID-19 case fatality rates.[335] The study found that, on average, regions where malaria is endemic reported lower COVID-19 case fatality rates compared to regions without endemic malaria.
 In 2017, a bacterial strain of the genus Serratia was genetically modified to prevent malaria in mosquitos[336][337] and in 2023, it has been reported that the bacterium Delftia tsuruhatensis naturally prevents the development of malaria by secreting a molecule called Harmane.[338][339][340]
 Other avenue that can contribute to understanding of malaria transmission, is the source of meal for the vector when they have the parasites. Its known that plant sugars are the primary source of nutrients for survival of adult mosquitoes,[341] therefore utilising this link for management of the vector will contribute in mitigating malaria transmission.[342][343]
 While none of the main four species of malaria parasite that cause human infections are known to have animal reservoirs,[344] P. knowlesi is known to regularly infect both humans and non-human primates.[49] Other non-human primate malarias (particularly P. cynomolgi and P. simium) have also been found to have spilled over into humans.[345] Nearly 200 Plasmodium species have been identified that infect birds, reptiles, and other mammals,[346] and about 30 of them naturally infect non-human primates.[347] Some malaria parasites of non-human primates (NHP) serve as model organisms for human malarial parasites, such as P. coatneyi (a model for P. falciparum) and P. cynomolgi (a model for P. vivax). Diagnostic techniques used to detect parasites in NHP are similar to those employed for humans.[348] Malaria parasites that infect rodents are widely used as models in research, such as P. berghei.[349] Avian malaria primarily affects species of the order Passeriformes, and poses a substantial threat to birds of Hawaii, the Galapagos, and other archipelagoes. The parasite P. relictum is known to play a role in limiting the distribution and abundance of endemic Hawaiian birds. Global warming is expected to increase the prevalence and global distribution of avian malaria, as elevated temperatures provide optimal conditions for parasite reproduction.[350]

"Malaria is caused by parasites that enter your body through the bite of an infected mosquito. This sometimes fatal disease happens in hot and humid places, like Africa. Malaria is a serious disease that spreads when you’re bitten by a mosquito infected by tiny parasites. When it bites, the mosquito injects malaria parasites into your bloodstream. Malaria is caused by the parasites, not by a virus or by a type of bacterium. If it isn’t treated, malaria can cause severe health problems such as seizures, brain damage, trouble breathing, organ failure and death. The disease is rare in the U.S., with about 2,000 cases per year. If you’re traveling to an area where malaria is common, talk to your healthcare provider about ways you can prevent being infected. People who are infected and travel to the U.S. can spread the disease if a mosquito bites them and then bites someone else. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Malaria is common in tropical areas where it’s hot and humid. In 2020, there were 241 million reported cases of malaria throughout the world, with 627,000 deaths due to malaria. The majority of these cases occur in Africa and South Asia. Malaria occurs all over the world and happens most often in developing countries and areas with warm temperatures and high humidity, including: Advertisement Anyone can get malaria, but people who live in Africa have a higher risk of infection than others. Young children, older people and those who are pregnant have an increased risk of dying from malaria. People who live in poverty and don’t have access to healthcare are more likely to have complications from the disease. More than 90% of malaria deaths occur in Africa, and nearly all of the people who die are young children. More than 80% of malaria deaths in the region in 2020 involved children under the age of 5 years old. When a mosquito bites someone who has malaria, the mosquito becomes infected. When that mosquito bites someone else, it transfers a parasite to the other person’s bloodstream. There, the parasites multiply. There are five types of malaria parasites that can infect humans. In rare cases, people who are pregnant and who have malaria can transfer the disease to their children before or during birth. It’s possible, but unlikely, for malaria to be passed through blood transfusions, organ donations and hypodermic needles. Advertisement Signs and symptoms of malaria are similar to flu symptoms. They include: As malaria gets worse, it can cause anemia and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). The most severe form of malaria, which may progress to a coma, is known as cerebral malaria. This type represents about 15% of deaths in children and nearly 20% of adult deaths. Malaria symptoms usually appear 10 days to one month after the person was infected. Depending on the type of parasite, symptoms can be mild. Some people don’t feel sick for up to a year after the mosquito bite. Parasites can sometimes live in the body for several years without causing symptoms. Some types of malaria, depending on the type of parasite, can occur again. The parasites are inactive in your liver and then are released into your bloodstream after years. The symptoms begin again when the parasites begin circulating. Your healthcare provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms and travel history. It’s important to share information about the countries you’ve visited recently so that your provider can clearly understand your risk. Your provider will take a sample of your blood and send it to a lab to see if you have malaria parasites. The blood test will tell your provider if you have malaria and will also identify the type of parasite that’s causing your symptoms. Your provider will use this information to determine the right treatment. It’s important to start treating malaria as soon as possible. Your provider will prescribe medications to kill the malaria parasite. Some parasites are resistant to malaria drugs. Some drugs are given in combination with other drugs. The type of parasite will determine what type of medication you take and how long you take it. Antimalarial drugs include: Medications can cure you of malaria. Antimalarial drugs can cause side effects. Be sure to tell your provider about other medicines you’re taking, since antimalarial drugs can interfere with them. Depending on the medication, side effects may include: If you plan on living temporarily in or traveling to an area where malaria is common, talk to your provider about taking medications to prevent malaria. You will need to take the drugs before, during and after your stay. Medications can greatly reduce the chances of getting malaria. These drugs can’t be used for treatment if you do develop malaria despite taking them. You should also take precautions to avoid mosquito bites. To lower your chances of getting malaria, you should: There’s a vaccine for children which was developed and tested in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi in a pilot program. The RTS, S/AS01 vaccine is effective against Plasmodium falciparum malaria, which causes severe disease in children. Other programs are working to develop a malaria vaccine. If malaria isn’t treated properly, it can cause serious health problems, including permanent organ damage and death. It’s essential to seek treatment right away if you think you have malaria or have visited an area where it is common. Treatment is much more effective when it’s started early. The right medication and correct dose can treat malaria and clear the infection from your body. If you’ve had malaria before, you can get it again if an infected mosquito bites you. If you’ve traveled to or live in a country where malaria is common and you have symptoms of malaria, see your provider immediately. Early diagnosis makes treatment more effective. It’s also important to seek treatment right away to stop malaria from spreading to others. Over the years, scientists have found that people with sickle cell trait have some protection against the type of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. It seems that the sickle shape of the red blood cells captures the parasites and helps to destroy them. Studies continue in a bid to find out how to apply this information. Sickle cell trait happens when you have one sickle cell gene and one normal gene. It’s not the same as sickle cell disease. Sickle cell anemia is part of a group of blood disorders known as sickle cell disease. A note from Cleveland Clinic Malaria is a serious illness, but you can take steps to prevent it. You can lower your risk of infection by protecting yourself from mosquito bites and taking preventive medications. If you’re traveling where malaria is common, talk to your provider several weeks before you leave. This is especially important if you’re pregnant. Last reviewed on 05/18/2022.

 Malaria is a serious infection spread by mosquitoes. If it's not diagnosed and treated quickly, you can die from it. Malaria is caused by being bitten by an infected mosquito. It can take just 1 bite to get it. The infection is very common in certain parts of the world. It's found in tropical regions, including: Malaria is not found in the UK and you cannot catch it from another person. It's important to check the malaria risk for the country you're travelling to before you go. You're still at risk of getting malaria if you now live in the UK but were born or used to live in a high-risk country. You will not be immune to malaria anymore. Find out more about the risk of malaria in specific countries on the Travel Health Pro website If you're travelling to an area where malaria is found, get advice from a GP, nurse, pharmacist or travel clinic before you go. It's best to do this at least 4 to 6 weeks before you travel, but you can still get advice at the last minute if you need to. You may be prescribed antimalarial tablets to reduce the risk of getting malaria and told how you can prevent mosquito bites. take any antimalarial medicine you're prescribed – you usually need to start taking it a few days or weeks before you go, until a few weeks after you get back use insect repellent on your skin – make sure it's 50% DEET-based sleep under mosquito nets treated with insecticide wear long-sleeved clothing and trousers to cover your arms and legs in the evening, when mosquitos are most active It's especially important to get advice before you travel if you're at higher risk of getting seriously ill from malaria. This includes: You may be prescribed antimalarial medicine even if you're travelling to a low-risk area. Malaria can be hard to spot, but symptoms include: These symptoms usually appear between 7 and 18 days after you've been bitten by an infected mosquito. But sometimes you may not have symptoms for months after travel, and rarely years. You should also tell anyone you travelled with to get help straight away. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online. Get medical advice quickly if you have malaria symptoms while you're travelling. Malaria is an emergency and needs to be treated quickly. It's treated with antimalarial medicines. Some people will stay in hospital to have specialist care and treatment. Malaria can sometimes come back and will need to be treated again if this happens.

"A migraine is much more than a bad headache. It can cause debilitating, throbbing, one-sided head pain that can leave you in bed for days. Movement, lights, sounds and other triggers may cause symptoms like fatigue, nausea, vision changes, irritability and more. A healthcare provider can help you manage symptoms so migraines don’t take over your life. A migraine is a severe headache that causes throbbing, pulsing head pain on one side of your head. The headache phase of a migraine usually lasts at least four hours, but it can also last for days. This headache gets worse with: Migraines are disruptive. They can interfere with your daily routine and affect your ability to meet personal and social obligations. Treatment is available to help you manage migraines. There are several types of migraines. The most common migraine categories are: An aura is a phase of the migraine before head pain begins. Other types of migraines include: Migraines are common. Studies show that an estimated 12% of people in the United States experience migraines. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy There are four phases or stages of a migraine: It can take about eight to 72 hours to go through the four stages. Migraine symptoms vary based on the stage. Every migraine is different, and you won’t necessarily experience symptoms during all four stages of every migraine. Head pain gradually gets more intense. It can affect one side of your head or both. It can occur with other symptoms like: Advertisement Migraine headache pain may feel like the following: A migraine can feel different for each person. A migraine headache ranges from mild to severe. Head pain can start on one side and shift to the opposite side. You may also have pain around your eyes or temple, and sometimes, around your face, sinuses, jaw or neck. The frequency of a migraine varies from person to person. You might have one migraine per year or one per week. On average, most people experience two to four per month. They’re most common in the morning. Most migraines are unpredictable, but sometimes, you can have an idea of when a migraine will happen, like before menstruation or after feeling stress. Researchers aren’t sure of the exact cause of migraines, but studies show genetics play a role. When you have a headache, specific nerves in your blood vessels send pain signals to your brain. This releases inflammatory substances into your head’s nerves and blood vessels. It’s unclear why your nerves do that. A trigger is something that causes symptoms to start. Some of the most common migraine triggers include: Your healthcare provider can help you identify your triggers. They might recommend keeping a migraine journal to track similarities between migraine attacks. What foods trigger migraines? Your body may have a sensitivity to specific chemicals and preservatives in foods. This sensitivity makes a migraine more likely to happen, especially if combined with other triggers. Some of the most common food triggers include: Yes, migraines tend to run in biological families. Up to 80% of people with migraines have a first-degree biological relative with the condition. A migraine can affect anyone at any age, from children to adults. Women and people assigned female at birth are more likely than men and people assigned male at birth to experience a migraine. Other risk factors that may make you more likely to experience a migraine include: Advertisement A healthcare provider will diagnose a migraine after a physical exam and neurological exam. They’ll also learn more about your medical history and biological family health history. Your provider may ask you questions to learn more about your symptoms, including: Your provider may also order blood tests and imaging tests (such as a CT scan or an MRI) to make sure there aren’t any other causes for your headache. An electroencephalogram (EEG) may help your provider rule out other conditions. If you think you have a migraine, discuss your symptoms with a primary care physician (PCP) first. They can diagnose migraine headaches and start treatment. Your PCP may refer you to a headache specialist or a neurologist. There isn’t a cure for migraines. But a healthcare provider can help you manage migraine symptoms through the following: A healthcare provider might recommend taking medications to treat migraines. There are two types of medications available: Common medications that stop migraines include: Common preventive migraine medications include: Medications come in different forms, like: You and your healthcare provider will discuss the specific medication, combination of medications and formulations to best manage your symptoms. All medications should be used under the direction of a headache specialist or provider. As with any medication, it’s important to carefully follow your provider’s instructions. Over-the-counter migraine medications Over-the-counter migraine medications are effective if you have mild to moderate migraine symptoms. The main ingredients in pain-relieving medications are ibuprofen, aspirin, acetaminophen, naproxen and caffeine. Be cautious when taking over-the-counter pain relievers. Sometimes, overusing them can cause analgesic-rebound headaches or a dependency problem. If you’re taking any over-the-counter pain medications more than two to three times a week, let your healthcare provider know. They may suggest more effective prescription medications. A healthcare provider can help you identify what triggers your migraines. They may ask you to keep a migraine journal or diary. A migraine journal can help you keep track of when a migraine happened, how you felt and how long it lasted. You can also add details about the foods you ate or the activities you participated in to learn more about any possible triggers. There are some smartphone apps available to help you keep a migraine journal. Once you identify a trigger, you can take steps to avoid it. This isn’t always possible, but awareness of your triggers is helpful to identify them and treat a migraine when it starts. For example, if stress is a trigger, you may want to speak with a mental health professional to help you manage your stress. If you get migraine symptoms when you miss a meal, set an alarm on your phone to remind you to eat meals on a regular schedule. You may want to try alternative therapies to help you manage migraines. These include: Talk to your healthcare provider before starting any alternative therapies for migraines. Talk to your healthcare provider if you’re pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant and experience migraines. Your provider might suggest avoiding medications for migraines when you’re pregnant or if you think you may be pregnant. Some medications can negatively affect the fetus’s development. Your provider can recommend alternative treatment options like an acetaminophen pain reliever for migraines. There are certain things you can do to help you feel better when a migraine attack happens, including: You can’t prevent all migraines. But you can take preventive migraine medications as directed by your healthcare provider to reduce how often and how severe migraine symptoms affect you. You can also learn more about your triggers and work with your healthcare provider to avoid them. Migraines are different for each person. They’re temporary but recurring throughout your life. There’s also no available cure. Your healthcare provider can help you manage migraines so they go away faster and are less intense. It may take time to find a treatment option that’s right for you. Let your healthcare provider know if your symptoms improve or get worse. Schedule a visit with your healthcare provider if you experience: Call 911 (or your local emergency services number) or go to an emergency department right away if you: You’ve probably had a headache before, but a migraine is different. It can feel like the world is ending and there’s nothing you can do to make it go away.

"Migraine is a neurological condition that typically causes painful headache attacks that occur with additional symptoms, such as sensitivity to light, sound, smell, or touch.  More than just the cause of “really bad headaches,” migraine is a neurological condition that can cause multiple symptoms. While intense, debilitating headaches frequently characterize it, additional symptoms may include: The condition often runs in families and can affect all ages. People assigned female at birth are more likely than people assigned male at birth to be diagnosed with migraine. The diagnosis of migraine is determined based on clinical history, reported symptoms, and by ruling out other causes. The most common categories of migraine headaches (or attacks) are episodic versus chronic, and then those without aura and those with aura. People describe migraine pain as: It can also feel like a severe, dull, steady ache. The pain may start out as mild. But without treatment, it can become moderate to severe. Migraine pain most commonly affects the forehead area. It’s usually on one side of the head, but it can occur on both sides or shift. Most migraine attacks last about 4 hours. If they’re not treated or don’t respond to treatment, they can last for as long as 72 hours to a week. In migraine with aura, pain may overlap with an aura or may never occur at all. Migraine symptoms may begin 1 to 2 days before the headache itself. This is known as the prodrome stage. Symptoms during this stage can include: In migraine with aura, the aura occurs after the prodrome stage. During an aura, you may have problems with your vision, sensation, movement, and speech. Examples of these problems include: The next phase is known as the attack phase. This is the most acute or severe of the phases when the actual migraine pain occurs. In some people, this can overlap or occur during an aura. Attack phase symptoms can last anywhere from hours to days. Symptoms of migraine can vary from person to person. Some symptoms may include: After the attack phase, a person will often experience the postdrome phase. During this phase, there are usually changes in mood and feelings. These can range from feeling euphoric and extremely happy to feeling very fatigued and apathetic. A mild, dull headache may persist. The length and intensity of these phases can occur to different degrees in different people. Sometimes, a phase gets skipped, and a migraine attack may occur without causing a headache. Researchers haven’t identified a definitive cause for migraine. But they still believe the condition is due to “abnormal” brain activity that affects nerve signaling, and chemicals and blood vessels in the brain. There are also many migraine triggers that are continually reported, including: If you experience a migraine attack, your doctor may ask you to keep a headache journal. Writing down what you were doing, what foods you ate, and what medications you took before your migraine attack began can help identify your triggers. Migraine can’t be cured, but your doctor can help you manage migraine attacks by giving you the tools to treat symptoms when they occur, which may lead to fewer attacks in general. Treatment can also help make migraine less severe. Your treatment plan depends on: Your treatment plan may include a combination of: If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here. Medications can be used to either prevent a migraine attack from happening or treat it once it occurs. You may be able to get relief with OTC medication. But if OTC medications aren’t effective, your doctor may decide to prescribe other medications. The severity of your migraine and any other health conditions you have will determine which treatment is right for you. Acute medications — taken as soon as you suspect a migraine attack is coming — include: Preventative medications — prescribed to people whose migraine attacks can be debilitating or happen more than four times a month — are taken once a day, or every 3 months via injection. These medications include: While migraine attack triggers can be very personal, certain foods or food ingredients may be more likely to trigger an attack than others. These may include: Tyramine also increases when foods are fermented or aged. These include foods like some aged cheeses, sauerkraut, and soy sauce. But ongoing research is looking more closely at the role of tyramine in migraines, as it may not be as big of a trigger as previously thought. Other migraine attack triggers can be varied and seem random: Keeping a journal of when your migraine attacks occur can help you identify your personal triggers. There are many types of migraine. Two of the most common types are migraine without aura and migraine with aura. Some people have both types. Many people living with migraine have more than one type of migraine. Most people with migraine don’t experience an aura with their headaches. Individuals who have migraine without an aura have had at least five attacks that have these characteristics: An aura typically occurs in 25 percent of people who have migraine. If you have a migraine with aura, you most likely have at least two attacks that have these characteristics: An aura usually occurs before the headache pain begins, but it can continue once the attack starts. Alternatively, an aura may start at the same time as the attack does. Chronic migraine used to be called a “combination” or “mixed” because it can have features of migraine and a tension headache. It’s also sometimes called a severe migraine headache and can be caused by medication overuse. People who have chronic migraine have a severe tension headache or migraine attack more than 15 days a month for 3 or more months. More than eight of those attacks are migraine with or without aura. Some additional risk factors that may make an individual susceptible to chronic migraine include: Acute migraine is a general term for a migraine attack that isn’t diagnosed as chronic. Another name for this type is episodic migraine. People who have episodic migraine have attacks up to 14 days a month. Thus, people with episodic migraine have fewer attacks a month than people with chronic ones. Vestibular migraine is also known as migraine-associated vertigo. About 1 percent of the general population lives with vestibular migraine. The symptoms affect balance, cause dizziness, or both. People of any age, including children, may experience vestibular migraine attacks. If diagnosed, your doctor may suggest you see a vestibular rehabilitation therapist. They can teach you exercises to help you stay balanced when your symptoms are at their worst. Because these migraine attacks can be so debilitating, you and your doctor may talk about taking preventive medications. According to the National Headache Foundation, menstrual-related migraine affects up to 60 percent of women who experience any type of migraine. It can occur with or without an aura. Attacks can also happen before, during, or after menstruation and during ovulation. Research has shown that menstrual migraine tends to be more intense, last longer, and have more significant nausea than migraine not associated with the menstrual cycle. Migraine aura without headache, also called a silent migraine or visual migraine without headache, occurs when a person has an aura, but doesn’t get a headache. This type of migraine is more common in people who start having migraines after age 40. Visual aura symptoms are most common. With this type of migraine, the aura may gradually occur, with symptoms spreading over several minutes and moving from one symptom to another. After visual symptoms, people may have numbness, speech problems, and/or tingling in the face or hands. Hormonal migraine, or menstrual migraine, is linked with the female hormones, commonly estrogen. Many people who ovulate report migraine headaches during: Many people experience nausea as a symptom of migraine. Many also vomit. These symptoms may start at the same time the attack does. Usually, though, they start about 1 hour after the headache pain begins. Nausea and vomiting can be as troubling as the attack itself. If you only have nausea, you may be able to take your usual migraine medications. Vomiting, though, can prevent you from being able to take pills or keep them in your body long enough to be absorbed. If you have to delay taking migraine medication, migraine is likely to become more severe. If you have nausea and vomiting, your doctor may suggest medication to ease nausea called anti-nausea or antiemetic drugs. In this case, the antiemetic can help prevent vomiting and improve nausea. Acupressure may also be helpful in treating migraine nausea. A 2012 study showed that acupressure reduced the intensity of migraine-associated nausea starting as soon as 30 minutes, gaining improvement over 4 hours. If you’ve been diagnosed with migraine, there are a few options that may help you prevent a migraine attack. Some may work better for you than others: Doctors diagnose migraine by listening to your symptoms, taking a thorough medical and family history, and performing a physical exam to rule out other potential causes. Imaging scans, like a CT scan or MRI, can rule out other causes, including: Surgery for migraine isn’t recommended, but some medical tools have been studied and endorsed for helping lessen migraine attacks by either decreasing or increasing nervous system activity. Currently, the FDA has approved four neuromodulation treatments: Talk with your doctor about the best neuromodulation treatment for you and your specific type of migraine. Children can have many of the same types of migraine as adults. Until they’re older teens, children may be more likely to have symptoms on both sides of the head. It’s rare for children to have headache pain in the back of the head. Their migraine attacks tend to last 2 to 72 hours. A few migraine variants are more common in children. One of the more common variants is abdominal migraine. Children with abdominal migraine may have a stomachache instead of a headache. The pain can be moderate or severe. Usually, pain is in the middle of the stomach, around the belly button. But the pain may not be in this specific area. The belly may just feel “sore.” Your child may also have experience headache. Other symptoms can include: Children who have abdominal migraine are likely to develop more typical migraine symptoms as adults. For many pregnant people, their migraine attacks improve during pregnancy. But they may become worse following delivery due to sudden hormonal shifts. Attacks during pregnancy need special attention to make sure that the cause of the attack is understood. Research is ongoing, but a recent small study showed that women with migraine during pregnancy experienced a higher rate of having: Certain migraine medications may not be considered safe during pregnancy. This can include aspirin. If you have migraine during pregnancy, work with your doctor to find ways to treat your migraine that won’t harm your developing baby. The frequent and recurring use of migraine medication can sometimes cause what’s known as medication overuse headache (previously called a rebound headache). When determining how to deal with migraine, talk with your doctor about the frequency of your medication intake. Also, make sure to discuss alternatives to medications. Migraine and tension headaches, the most common type of headaches, share some similar symptoms. But migraine is also associated with many symptoms not shared by tension headaches. Migraine and tension headaches also respond differently to the same treatments. Both tension headaches and migraine can have: Only migraine can have these symptoms: You can try a few things at home that may also help remedy the pain from migraine: Sometimes the symptoms of migraine can mimic those of a stroke. It’s important to seek immediate medical attention if you or a loved one has a headache that: If headaches are getting in the way of your daily life, and you’re not sure if they are a migraine symptom, it’s important to talk with your doctor. Headaches can be a sign of other issues, and while migraine can feel debilitating at times, there are many treatments available.

 Migraine (UK: /ˈmiːɡreɪn/, US: /ˈmaɪ-/)[11][12] is a genetically influenced complex neurological disorder characterized by episodes of moderate-to-severe headache, most often unilateral and generally associated with nausea and light and sound sensitivity.[1] Other characterizing symptoms may include vomiting, cognitive dysfunction, allodynia, and dizziness. Exacerbation of headache symptoms during physical activity is another distinguishing feature.[13] Up to one-third of migraine sufferers experience aura, a premonitory period of sensory disturbance widely accepted to be caused by cortical spreading depression at the onset of a migraine attack.[13] Although primarily considered to be a headache disorder, migraine is highly heterogenous in its clinical presentation and is better thought of as a spectrum disease rather than a distinct clinical entity.[14] Disease burden can range from episodic discrete attacks to chronic disease.[14][15]
 Migraine is believed to be caused by a mixture of environmental and genetic factors that influence the excitation and inhibition of nerve cells in the brain.[3] An older ""vascular hypothesis"" postulated that the aura of migraine is produced by vasoconstriction and the headache of migraine is produced by vasodilation, but the vasoconstrictive mechanism has been disproven,[16] and the role of vasodilation in migraine pathophysiology is uncertain.[17][18] The accepted hypothesis suggests that multiple primary neuronal impairments lead to a series of intracranial and extracranial changes, triggering a physiological cascade that leads to migraine symptomatology.[19]
 Initial recommended treatment for acute attacks is with over-the-counter analgesics (pain medication) such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) for headache, antiemetics (anti-nausea medication) for nausea, and the avoidance of triggers.[9] Specific medications such as triptans, ergotamines, or CGRP inhibitors may be used in those experiencing headaches that are refractory to simple pain medications.[20] For individuals who experience four or more attacks per month, or could otherwise benefit from prevention, prophylactic medication is recommended.[21] Commonly prescribed prophylactic medications include beta blockers like propranolol, anticonvulsants like sodium valproate, antidepressants like amitriptyline, and other off-label classes of medications.[8] Preventive medications inhibit migraine pathophysiology through various mechanisms, such as blocking calcium and sodium channels, blocking gap junctions, and inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases, among other mechanisms.[22][23] Nonpharmacological preventative therapies include nutritional supplementation, dietary interventions, sleep improvement, and aerobic exercise.[24]
 Globally, approximately 15% of people are affected by migraine.[10] In the Global Burden of Disease Study, conducted in 2010, migraines ranked as the third-most prevalent disorder in the world.[25] It most often starts at puberty and is worst during middle age.[1] As of 2016[update], it is one of the most common causes of disability.[26]
 Migraine typically presents with self-limited, recurrent severe headache associated with autonomic symptoms.[5][27] About 15–30% of people living with migraine experience episodes with aura,[9][28] and they also frequently experience episodes without aura.[29] The severity of the pain, duration of the headache, and frequency of attacks are variable.[5] A migraine attack lasting longer than 72 hours is termed status migrainosus.[30] There are four possible phases to a migraine attack, although not all the phases are necessarily experienced:[13]
 Migraine is associated with major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and obsessive–compulsive disorder. These psychiatric disorders are approximately 2–5 times more common in people without aura, and 3–10 times more common in people with aura.[31]
 Prodromal or premonitory symptoms occur in about 60% of those with migraines,[2][32] with an onset that can range from two hours to two days before the start of pain or the aura.[33] These symptoms may include a wide variety of phenomena,[34] including altered mood, irritability, depression or euphoria, fatigue, craving for certain food(s), stiff muscles (especially in the neck), constipation or diarrhea, and sensitivity to smells or noise.[32] This may occur in those with either migraine with aura or migraine without aura.[35] Neuroimaging indicates the limbic system and hypothalamus as the origin of prodromal symptoms in migraine.[36]
 Aura is a transient focal neurological phenomenon that occurs before or during the headache.[2] Aura appears gradually over a number of minutes (usually occurring over 5–60 minutes) and generally lasts less than 60 minutes.[37][38] Symptoms can be visual, sensory or motoric in nature, and many people experience more than one.[39] Visual effects occur most frequently: they occur in up to 99% of cases and in more than 50% of cases are not accompanied by sensory or motor effects.[39] If any symptom remains after 60 minutes, the state is known as persistent aura.[40]
 Visual disturbances often consist of a scintillating scotoma (an area of partial alteration in the field of vision which flickers and may interfere with a person's ability to read or drive).[2] These typically start near the center of vision and then spread out to the sides with zigzagging lines which have been described as looking like fortifications or walls of a castle.[39] Usually the lines are in black and white but some people also see colored lines.[39] Some people lose part of their field of vision known as hemianopsia while others experience blurring.[39]
 Sensory aura are the second most common type; they occur in 30–40% of people with auras.[39] Often a feeling of pins-and-needles begins on one side in the hand and arm and spreads to the nose–mouth area on the same side.[39] Numbness usually occurs after the tingling has passed with a loss of position sense.[39] Other symptoms of the aura phase can include speech or language disturbances, world spinning, and less commonly motor problems.[39] Motor symptoms indicate that this is a hemiplegic migraine, and weakness often lasts longer than one hour unlike other auras.[39] Auditory hallucinations or delusions have also been described.[41]
 Classically the headache is unilateral, throbbing, and moderate to severe in intensity.[37] It usually comes on gradually[37] and is aggravated by physical activity during a migraine attack.[13] However, the effects of physical activity on migraine are complex, and some researchers have concluded that, while exercise can trigger migraine attacks, regular exercise may have a prophylactic effect and decrease frequency of attacks.[42] The feeling of pulsating pain is not in phase with the pulse.[43] In more than 40% of cases, however, the pain may be bilateral (both sides of the head), and neck pain is commonly associated with it.[44] Bilateral pain is particularly common in those who have migraine without aura.[2] Less commonly pain may occur primarily in the back or top of the head.[2] The pain usually lasts 4 to 72 hours in adults;[37] however, in young children frequently lasts less than 1 hour.[45] The frequency of attacks is variable, from a few in a lifetime to several a week, with the average being about one a month.[46][47]
 The pain is frequently accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, sensitivity to smells, fatigue, and irritability.[2] Many thus seek a dark and quiet room.[48] In a basilar migraine, a migraine with neurological symptoms related to the brain stem or with neurological symptoms on both sides of the body,[49] common effects include a sense of the world spinning, light-headedness, and confusion.[2] Nausea occurs in almost 90% of people, and vomiting occurs in about one-third.[48] Other symptoms may include blurred vision, nasal stuffiness, diarrhea, frequent urination, pallor, or sweating.[50] Swelling or tenderness of the scalp may occur as can neck stiffness.[50] Associated symptoms are less common in the elderly.[51]
 Sometimes, aura occurs without a subsequent headache.[39] This is known in modern classification as a typical aura without headache, or acephalgic migraine in previous classification, or commonly as a silent migraine.[52][53] However, silent migraine can still produce debilitating symptoms, with visual disturbance, vision loss in half of both eyes, alterations in color perception, and other sensory problems, like sensitivity to light, sound, and odors.[54] It can last from 15 to 30 minutes, usually no longer than 60 minutes, and it can recur or appear as an isolated event.[53]
 The migraine postdrome could be defined as that constellation of symptoms occurring once the acute headache has settled.[55] Many report a sore feeling in the area where the migraine was, and some report impaired thinking for a few days after the headache has passed. The person may feel tired or ""hung over"" and have head pain, cognitive difficulties, gastrointestinal symptoms, mood changes, and weakness.[56] According to one summary, ""Some people feel unusually refreshed or euphoric after an attack, whereas others note depression and malaise.""[57][unreliable medical source?]
 The underlying causes of migraines are unknown.[58] However, they are believed to be related to a mix of environmental and genetic factors.[3] They run in families in about two-thirds of cases[5] and rarely occur due to a single gene defect.[59] While migraines were once believed to be more common in those of high intelligence, this does not appear to be true.[46] A number of psychological conditions are associated, including depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder.[60]
 Success of the surgical migraine treatment by decompression of extracranial sensory nerves adjacent to vessels[61] suggests that migraineurs may have anatomical predisposition for neurovascular compression that may be caused by both intracranial and extracranial vasodilation due to migraine triggers. This, along with the existence of numerous cranial neural interconnections,[62] may explain the multiple cranial nerve involvement and consequent diversity of migraine symptoms.[63]
 Studies of twins indicate a 34% to 51% genetic influence of likelihood to develop migraine.[3] This genetic relationship is stronger for migraine with aura than for migraines without aura.[29] It is clear from family and populations studies, that migraine is a complex disorders, where numerous of genetic risk variants exist, and where each variant increase the risk of migraine marginally.[64][65] It is also known that having several of these risk variants increase the risk by a small to moderate amount.[59]
 Single gene disorders that result in migraines are rare.[59] One of these is known as familial hemiplegic migraine, a type of migraine with aura, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.[66][67] Four genes have been shown to be involved in familial hemiplegic migraine.[68] Three of these genes are involved in ion transport.[68] The fourth is the axonal protein PRRT2, associated with the exocytosis complex.[68] Another genetic disorder associated with migraine is CADASIL syndrome or cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.[2] One meta-analysis found a protective effect from angiotensin converting enzyme polymorphisms on migraine.[69] The TRPM8 gene, which codes for a cation channel, has been linked to migraines.[70]
 The common forms migraine are Polygenetic, where common variants of numerous genes contributes to the predisposition for migraine.  These genes can be placed in three categories increaseing the risk of migraine in general, specifically migraine with aura, or migraine without aura.[71][72] Three of these genes, CALCA, CALCB, and HTR1F are already target for migraine specific treatments. Five genes are specific risk to migraine with aura, PALMD, ABO, LRRK2, CACNA1A and PRRT2, and 13 genes are specific to migriane without aura. Using the accumulated genetic risk of the common variations, into a so-called polygenetic risk, it is possible to assess e.g. the treatment response to triptans.[73][74]
 Migraine may be induced by triggers, with some reporting it as an influence in a minority of cases[5] and others the majority.[75] Many things such as fatigue, certain foods, alcohol, and weather have been labeled as triggers; however, the strength and significance of these relationships are uncertain.[75][76] Most people with migraines report experiencing triggers.[77] Symptoms may start up to 24 hours after a trigger.[5]
 Common triggers quoted are stress, hunger, and fatigue (these equally contribute to tension headaches).[75] Psychological stress has been reported as a factor by 50 to 80% of people.[78] Migraine has also been associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and abuse.[79] Migraine episodes are more likely to occur around menstruation.[78] Other hormonal influences, such as menarche, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, perimenopause, and menopause, also play a role.[80] These hormonal influences seem to play a greater role in migraine without aura.[46] Migraine episodes typically do not occur during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, or following menopause.[2]
 Between 12% and 60% of people report foods as triggers.[81][82]
 There are many reports[83][84][85][86][87] that tyramine – which is naturally present in chocolate, alcoholic beverages, most cheeses, processed meats, and other foods – can trigger migraine symptoms in some individuals. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) has been reported as a trigger for migraine,[88] but a systematic review concluded that ""a causal relationship between MSG and headache has not been proven... It would seem premature to conclude that the MSG present in food causes headache"".[89]
 A 2009 review on potential triggers in the indoor and outdoor environment concluded that while there were insufficient studies to confirm environmental factors as causing migraine, ""migraineurs worldwide consistently report similar environmental triggers"".[90]
 Migraine is believed to be primarily a neurological disorder,[91][92] while others believe it to be a neurovascular disorder with blood vessels playing the key role, although evidence does not support this completely.[93][94][95][96] Others believe both are likely important.[97][98][99][100] One theory is related to increased excitability of the cerebral cortex and abnormal control of pain neurons in the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem.[101]
 Sensitization of trigeminal pathways is a key pathophysiological phenomenon in migraine. It is debatable whether sensitization starts in the periphery or in the brain.[102][103]
 Cortical spreading depression, or spreading depression according to Leão, is a burst of neuronal activity followed by a period of inactivity, which is seen in those with migraines with aura.[104] There are a number of explanations for its occurrence, including activation of NMDA receptors leading to calcium entering the cell.[104] After the burst of activity, the blood flow to the cerebral cortex in the area affected is decreased for two to six hours.[104] It is believed that when depolarization travels down the underside of the brain, nerves that sense pain in the head and neck are triggered.[104]
 The exact mechanism of the head pain which occurs during a migraine episode is unknown.[105] Some evidence supports a primary role for central nervous system structures (such as the brainstem and diencephalon),[106] while other data support the role of peripheral activation (such as via the sensory nerves that surround blood vessels of the head and neck).[105] The potential candidate vessels include dural arteries, pial arteries and extracranial arteries such as those of the scalp.[105] The role of vasodilatation of the extracranial arteries, in particular, is believed to be significant.[107]
 Adenosine, a neuromodulator, may be involved.[108] Released after the progressive cleavage of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine acts on adenosine receptors to put the body and brain in a low activity state by dilating blood vessels and slowing the heart rate, such as before and during the early stages of sleep. Adenosine levels have been found to be high during migraine attacks.[108][109] Caffeine's role as an inhibitor of adenosine may explain its effect in reducing migraine.[110] Low levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), are also believed to be involved.[111]
 Calcitonin gene-related peptides (CGRPs) have been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of the pain associated with migraine, as levels of it become elevated during an attack.[9][43]
 The diagnosis of a migraine is based on signs and symptoms.[5] Neuroimaging tests are not necessary to diagnose migraine, but may be used to find other causes of headaches in those whose examination and history do not confirm a migraine diagnosis.[112] It is believed that a substantial number of people with the condition remain undiagnosed.[5]
 The diagnosis of migraine without aura, according to the International Headache Society, can be made according the ""5, 4, 3, 2, 1 criteria,"" which is as follows:[13]
 If someone experiences two of the following: photophobia, nausea, or inability to work or study for a day, the diagnosis is more likely.[113] In those with four out of five of the following: pulsating headache, duration of 4–72 hours, pain on one side of the head, nausea, or symptoms that interfere with the person's life, the probability that this is a migraine attack is 92%.[9] In those with fewer than three of these symptoms, the probability is 17%.[9]
 Migraine was first comprehensively classified in 1988.[29]
 The International Headache Society updated their classification of headaches in 2004.[13] A third version was published in 2018.[114] According to this classification, migraine is a primary headache disorder along with tension-type headaches and cluster headaches, among others.[115]
 Migraine is divided into six subclasses (some of which include further subdivisions):[116]
 The diagnosis of abdominal migraine is controversial.[118] Some evidence indicates that recurrent episodes of abdominal pain in the absence of a headache may be a type of migraine[118][119] or are at least a precursor to migraines.[29] These episodes of pain may or may not follow a migraine-like prodrome and typically last minutes to hours.[118] They often occur in those with either a personal or family history of typical migraine.[118] Other syndromes that are believed to be precursors include cyclical vomiting syndrome and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood.[29]
 Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms to a migraine headache include temporal arteritis, cluster headaches, acute glaucoma, meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage.[9] Temporal arteritis typically occurs in people over 50 years old and presents with tenderness over the temple, cluster headache presents with one-sided nose stuffiness, tears and severe pain around the orbits, acute glaucoma is associated with vision problems, meningitis with fevers, and subarachnoid hemorrhage with a very fast onset.[9] Tension headaches typically occur on both sides, are not pounding, and are less disabling.[9]
 Those with stable headaches that meet criteria for migraines should not receive neuroimaging to look for other intracranial disease.[120][121][122] This requires that other concerning findings such as papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) are not present. People with migraines are not at an increased risk of having another cause for severe headaches.[citation needed]
 Management of migraine includes prevention of migraine attacks and rescue treatment. There are three main aspects of treatment: trigger avoidance, acute (abortive), and preventive (prophylactic) control.[123]
 ""Migraine exists on a continuum of different attack frequencies and associated levels of disability.""[124] For those with occasional, episodic migraine, a ""proper combination of drugs for prevention and treatment of migraine attacks"" can limit the disease's impact on patients' personal and professional lives.[125] But fewer than half of people with migraine seek medical care and more than half go undiagnosed and undertreated.[126] ""Responsive prevention and treatment of migraine is incredibly important"" because evidence shows ""an increased sensitivity after each successive attack, eventually leading to chronic daily migraine in some individuals.""[125] Repeated migraine results in ""reorganization of brain circuitry,"" causing ""profound functional as well as structural changes in the brain.""[127] ""One of the most important problems in clinical migraine is the progression from an intermittent, self-limited inconvenience to a life-changing disorder of chronic pain, sensory amplification, and autonomic and affective disruption. This progression, sometimes termed chronification in the migraine literature, is common, affecting 3% of migraineurs in a given year, such that 8% of migraineurs have chronic migraine in any given year."" Brain imagery reveals that the electrophysiological changes seen during an attack become permanent in people with chronic migraine; ""thus, from an electrophysiological point of view, chronic migraine indeed resembles a never-ending migraine attack.""[127] Severe migraine ranks in the highest category of disability, according to the World Health Organization, which uses objective metrics to determine disability burden for the authoritative annual Global Burden of Disease report. The report classifies severe migraine alongside severe depression, active psychosis, quadriplegia, and terminal-stage cancer.[128]
 Migraine with aura appears to be a risk factor for ischemic stroke[129] doubling the risk.[130] Being a young adult, being female, using hormonal birth control, and smoking further increases this risk.[129] There also appears to be an association with cervical artery dissection.[131] Migraine without aura does not appear to be a factor.[132] The relationship with heart problems is inconclusive with a single study supporting an association.[129] Migraine does not appear to increase the risk of death from stroke or heart disease.[133] Preventative therapy of migraines in those with migraine with aura may prevent associated strokes.[134] People with migraine, particularly women, may develop higher than average numbers of white matter brain lesions of unclear significance.[135]
 Migraine is common, with around 33% of women and 18% of men affected at some point in their lifetime.[136]  Onset can be at any age, but prevalence rises sharply around puberty, and remains high until declining after age 50.[136] Before puberty, boys and girls are equally impacted, with around 5% of children experiencing migraines. From puberty onwards, women experience migraines at greater rates than men. From age 30 to 50, up to 4 times as many women experience migraines as men.[136], this is most pronouched in migraine without aura.[137]
 Worldwide, migraine affects nearly 15% or approximately one billion people.[10] In the United States, about 6% of men and 18% of women experience a migraine attack in a given year, with a lifetime risk of about 18% and 43% respectively.[5] In Europe, migraines affect 12–28% of people at some point in their lives with about 6–15% of adult men and 14–35% of adult women getting at least one yearly.[138] Rates of migraine are slightly lower in Asia and Africa than in Western countries.[46][139] Chronic migraine occurs in approximately 1.4 to 2.2% of the population.[140]
 During perimenopause symptoms often get worse before decreasing in severity.[141] While symptoms resolve in about two-thirds of the elderly, in 3–10% they persist.[51]
 An early description consistent with migraine is contained in the Ebers Papyrus, written around 1500 BCE in ancient Egypt.[142]
 The word migraine is from the Greek ἡμικρᾱνίᾱ (hēmikrāníā), 'pain in half of the head',[143] from ἡμι- (hēmi-), 'half' and κρᾱνίον (krāníon), 'skull'.[144]
 In 200 BCE, writings from the Hippocratic school of medicine described the visual aura that can precede the headache and a partial relief occurring through vomiting.[145]
 A second-century description by Aretaeus of Cappadocia divided headaches into three types: cephalalgia, cephalea, and heterocrania.[146] Galen of Pergamon used the term hemicrania (half-head), from which the word migraine was eventually derived.[146] He also proposed that the pain arose from the meninges and blood vessels of the head.[145] Migraine was first divided into the two now used types – migraine with aura (migraine ophthalmique) and migraine without aura (migraine vulgaire) in 1887 by Louis Hyacinthe Thomas, a French Librarian.[145] The mystical visions of Hildegard von Bingen, which she described as ""reflections of the living light"", are consistent with the visual aura experienced during migraines.[147]
 Trepanation, the deliberate drilling of holes into a skull, was practiced as early as 7,000 BCE.[142] While sometimes people survived, many would have died from the procedure due to infection.[148] It was believed to work via ""letting evil spirits escape"".[149] William Harvey recommended trepanation as a treatment for migraines in the 17th century.[150] The association between trepanation and headaches in ancient history may simply be a myth or unfounded speculation that originated several centuries later. In 1913, the world-famous American physician William Osler misinterpreted the French anthropologist and physician Paul Broca's words about a set of children's skulls from the Neolithic age that he found during the 1870s. These skulls presented no evident signs of fractures that could justify this complex surgery for mere medical reasons. Trepanation was probably born of superstitions, to remove ""confined demons"" inside the head, or to create healing or fortune talismans with the bone fragments removed from the skulls of the patients. However, Osler wanted to make Broca's theory more palatable to his modern audiences, and explained that trepanation procedures were used for mild conditions such as ""infantile convulsions headache and various cerebral diseases believed to be caused by confined demons.""[151]
 While many treatments for migraine have been attempted, it was not until 1868 that use of a substance which eventually turned out to be effective began.[145] This substance was the fungus ergot from which ergotamine was isolated in 1918 [152] and first used to treat migraines in 1925.[153] Methysergide was developed in 1959 and the first triptan, sumatriptan, was developed in 1988.[152] During the 20th century with better study-design, effective preventive measures were found and confirmed.[145]
 Migraine is a significant source of both medical costs and lost productivity. It has been estimated that migraine is the most costly neurological disorder in the European Community, costing more than €27 billion per year.[154] In the United States, direct costs have been estimated at $17 billion, while indirect costs – such as missed or decreased ability to work – is estimated at $15 billion.[155] Nearly a tenth of the direct cost is due to the cost of triptans.[155] In those who do attend work during a migraine attack, effectiveness is decreased by around a third.[154] Negative impacts also frequently occur for a person's family.[154]
 Transcranial magnetic stimulation shows promise,[9][156] as does transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimulation.[157] There is preliminary evidence that a ketogenic diet may help prevent episodic and long-term migraine.[158][159]
 Statistical data indicates that women may be more prone to having migraine, showing migraine incidence three times higher among women than men.[160][161] The Society for Women's Health Research has also mentioned hormonal influences, mainly estrogen, as having a considerable role in provoking migraine pain. Studies and research related to the sex dependencies of migraine are still ongoing, and conclusions have yet to be achieved.[162][163][164]

"Morgellons disease (MD) is a rare condition that involves fibers appearing underneath the skin or emerging from slow-healing skin sores. People with MD often report feeling stinging, crawling, or burning sensations on their skin. These symptoms can be painful and long lasting, affecting the quality of life. But the condition is controversial. While some doctors and scientists believe MD to be infection-based, others think it may be purely psychological. Read on to learn more about MD. MD is still a rather mysterious and poorly characterized condition. Because of this, there are limited studies on who exactly gets MD and if there are any risk factors associated with it. In response to the lack of information on MD at the time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted a population-based study between 2006 and 2008. The goal was to better characterize MD as a condition and learn more about the people who develop it. The findings of this study were published in 2012 in the scientific journal PLoS One. Researchers were able to identify 115 individuals with self-reported MD within an area of Northern California. Of this population, people reporting MD were more likely to be: Study participants also frequently reported experiencing chronic fatigue. Over half of them (54 percent) rated their overall health as fair to poor. Additionally, of the 40 people that completed a psychiatric assessment, 63 percent were found to have clinically significant somatic concerns. This is when physical symptoms cause significant worry or distress. Clinically significant depression was the next most common finding (11 percent). The primary symptoms of MD are multicolored fibers appearing under the skin or emerging from sores that are slow to heal. Because the fibers can be red, green, blue, white, or black, they may look like microscopic fibers from clothing. Another common symptom is the feeling of burning, stinging, or crawling on the skin. Additional symptoms of MD include: The lack of understanding about MD has led to controversy around the condition. Both psychological and infectious causes have been proposed. The fibers themselves are also controversial. Some believe that the microscopic fibers in MD are produced by the body. But certain research indicates otherwise. The 2012 CDC study analyzed 23 fiber or material samples collected from 12 study participants. It found that they were mostly made of superficial skin or from cellulose, which is a component of cotton fibers found in clothing. Dyes were detected in some samples as well. A 2016 case study used an electron microscope to compare fibers collected from a person with MD to fibers collected around their apartment, like human hair, pet hair, or plastic fibers. In this case, the fibers in the MD lesions were actually found to be from the environment and not the body. Meanwhile, a 2018 case study reported that the fibers themselves were inorganic and mixed in with keratin, a protein that’s important to the structure of skin. Inorganic means that a material doesn’t come from a living thing. MD has been poorly understood since it was first identified and named in the 1600s.  The childhood skin conditions called “the Morgellons” involved hairs or worms projecting from the skin, sparking debate about their origin. Both in the past and currently, some people with MD have believed that their skin was infested by parasites. This led to the condition being labeled “delusional parasitosis” in 1946 and the widespread belief that MD is a delusional disorder. You may also see it referred to as a type of delusional infestation. Indeed, many people reporting MD have a history of mental health conditions. A 2012 study evaluated 147 individuals who presented at the Mayo Clinic for diagnosis and treatment of a reported infestation. Of these, 20 percent reported having fibers on or in their skin. A retrospective analysis found that 81 percent of people included in the study had a history of psychological conditions. A smaller 2017 study included 35 people with MD at the Royal London Hospital. Researchers found that: Overall, it appears that there’s a link between MD and mental health. But additional, larger-scale studies are needed to further characterize the nature of this link. Another idea is that MD occurs as an effect of an infection. Most often, tick-borne infections like Lyme disease have been associated with MD. But a 2021 review of MD research notes that most of the studies published on an infectious cause of MD were published by the same group of authors and that they sometimes reuse participants across their studies. Further, one researcher in this group has been previously accused of scientific misconduct.  Outside of studies from this research group, evidence of an infectious cause of MD is rather scarce. Indeed, the 2012 CDC study was unable to find evidence of an infectious cause within their study population. One 2021 case study reported MD associated with recent exposure to a tick bite. But blood tests for Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, came back negative. Other case studies of people with MD have also found no evidence of B. burgdorferi infection. Overall, controversy around the MD is ongoing. Additional research is necessary to determine the cause of MD well as the most optimal ways to treat it. Suitable, effective treatment options for MD are still unknown. The controversy and lack of understanding around the disease can also make it difficult to get treatment. If your doctor thinks MD is caused by an infection, they may give you antibiotics and ointments to reduce itching. Since many people with MD have anxiety or depression as well, your treatment may also include mental health medications or counseling. On the other hand, if your doctor believes the condition is related to a mental health issue, they’ll likely recommend psychiatric medications or therapy. Research has suggested that a holistic approach that treats both the skin disease and your mental health may have positive results. For the best outcome, it’s important to establish a strong, long-term relationship with a doctor who listens to your concerns. Currently, there are no standard treatments or products known to cure MD. You can find many home remedies for MD online, but they may not be safe or effective. If you’re considering trying a treatment you found on your own, it’s best to research it and talk with your doctor first. People with skin conditions, including MD, may often pick at their skin. Repeated picking can cause or worsen sores and sometimes lead to an infection. Untreated infections can potentially develop into sepsis. This medical emergency can result in organ failure and death if it isn’t treated. Many people with MD also have depression, anxiety, or other mental health disorders. Still, more research is needed to determine the connection between these conditions. Researchers and doctors often disagree about MD, and there’s still a lot to discover about the disease. The controversy and limited understanding of the condition can make it especially hard to cope with it. It can be helpful connect and share information with others who also have MD. Support groups and other resources can help you stay up to date on current research about MD, give you advice on how to manage it, and provide a community of people with similar experiences. Support groups may be online or in-person, and a couple of examples include: Talking with others who have MD may help you better explain the disease to your family, friends, and doctor. You may also learn new ways to manage your symptoms and to advocate for yourself to get the care you need.

 Morgellons (/mɔːrˈɡɛlənz/) is the informal name of a self-diagnosed, scientifically unsubstantiated skin condition in which individuals have sores that they believe contain fibrous material.[1][2] Morgellons is not well understood, but the general medical consensus is that it is a form of delusional parasitosis,[3] on the psychiatric spectrum.[4] The sores are typically the result of compulsive scratching, and the fibers, when analysed, are consistently found to have originated from cotton and other textiles.[2][5]
 The condition was named in 2002 by Mary Leitao,[6] a mother who rejected the medical diagnosis of her son's delusional parasitosis. She chose the name from a letter written by a mid-17th-century physician.[7][8] Leitao and others involved in her Morgellons Research Foundation successfully lobbied members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigate the condition in 2006.[9][10] CDC researchers issued the results of their multi-year study in January 2012, indicating that no disease organisms were present in the samples from the individuals examined and that the fibers found were likely cotton. The researchers concluded that the condition was ""similar to more commonly recognized conditions such as delusional infestation"".[11][12]
 Morgellons is poorly understood but the general medical consensus is that it is a form of delusional parasitosis in which individuals have some form of skin condition with sores that they believe contain fibers.[1][2][5][13] Its presentation is very similar to delusional parasitosis, with the addition that people with the condition believe there are inanimate objects in their skin lesions. An active online community supports the notion that it is an infectious disease, disputes that it is psychological, and proposes an association with Lyme disease.  Controversy has resulted; publications ""largely from a single group of investigators"" describe findings of spirochetes, keratin and collagen in skin samples in small numbers of patients; these findings are contradicted by much larger studies conducted by the CDC, which found skin samples mostly contained cellulose that came from cotton, with no evidence of infection or other causes.[5]
 In 2001,[6] according to Leitao, her then-two-year-old son developed sores under his lip and began to complain of bugs.[14] Leitao says she examined the sores with her son's toy microscope and discovered red, blue, black, and white fibers.[6][7] She states that she took her son to see at least eight different doctors who were unable to find any disease, allergy, or anything unusual about her son's described symptoms. Fred Heldrich, a Johns Hopkins pediatrician with a reputation ""for solving mystery cases"", examined Leitao's son.[6] Heldrich found nothing abnormal about the boy's skin, and wrote to the referring physician that ""Leitao would benefit from a psychiatric evaluation and support"", and registered his worry about Leitao's ""use"" of her son.[6] Leitao last consulted an unnamed Johns Hopkins infectious disease specialist who refused to see her son after reviewing his records, and suggested Leitao herself might have ""Munchausen's by proxy, a psychiatric syndrome in which a parent pretends a child is sick or makes him sick to get attention from the medical system"".[7] According to Leitao, several medical professionals she sought out shared this opinion of a potential psychological disorder:[15]
 [Leitao] said she long ago grew accustomed to being doubted by doctors whenever she sought help for her son, who is now seven and still suffering from recurring lesions. ""They suggested that maybe I was neurotic,"" Leitao said. ""They said they were not interested in seeing him because I had Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy.""[16] Leitao says that her son developed more sores, and more fibers continued to poke out of them.[7][14] She and her husband, Edward Leitao, an internist, felt their son had ""something unknown"".[6] She chose the name Morgellons disease (with a hard g) from a description of an illness in the medical case-history essay, A Letter to a Friend (c. 1656, pub. 1690) by Sir Thomas Browne, where the physician describes several medical conditions in his experience, including ""that endemial distemper of children in Languedoc, called the morgellons, wherein they critically break out with harsh hairs on their backs"".[7][8]
 Leitao started the Morgellons Research Foundation (MRF) informally in 2002 and as an official non-profit in 2004.[7][17] The MRF website states that its purpose is to raise awareness and funding for research into the proposed condition, described by the organization as a ""poorly understood illness, which can be disfiguring and disabling"".[18] Leitao stated that she initially hoped to receive information from scientists or physicians who might understand the problem, but instead, thousands of others contacted her describing their sores and fibers, as well as neurological symptoms, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and other symptoms.[7]  The MRF claimed to have received self-identified reports of Morgellons from all 50 U.S. states and 15 other countries, including Canada, the UK, Australia, and the Netherlands. It also claimed that it had been contacted by over 12,000 families.[18]
 In 2012, the Morgellons Research Foundation closed down and directed future inquiries to the Oklahoma State University.[19]
 In May 2006, a CBS news segment on Morgellons aired in Southern California.[20] The same day, the Los Angeles County Department of Health services issued a statement saying, ""No credible medical or public health association has verified the existence or diagnosis of 'Morgellons Disease'"", and ""at this time there is no reason for individuals to panic over unsubstantiated reports of this disease"".[21] In June and July 2006, there were segments on CNN,[22] ABC's Good Morning America,[23] and NBC's The Today Show. In August 2006, a segment of the ABC show Medical Mysteries[14] was devoted to the subject. Morgellons was featured on ABC's Nightline on January 16, 2008,[24] and as the cover story of the January 20, 2008, issue of The Washington Post.[9]
 The first article to propose Morgellons as a new disease in a scientific journal was a review article co-authored by members of the MRF and published in 2006 by the American Journal of Clinical Dermatology.[25] A 2006 article in the San Francisco Chronicle reported, ""There have been no clinical studies"" of Morgellons disease.[25] A New Scientist article in 2007 also covered the phenomenon, noting that people are reporting similar symptoms in Europe and Australia.[26]
 In an article published in the Los Angeles Times on April 22, 2010, singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell claimed to have the condition.[27]
 On June 13, 2011, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio National broadcast The Mystery of Morgellons with guests including Mayo Clinic Professor Mark Davis.[28]
 The Morgellons Research Foundation coordinated a mailing campaign via their website, in which thousands of people sent form letters to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) task force, which first met in June 2006.[9][29][30] By August 2006, the task force consisted of 12 people, including two pathologists, a toxicologist, an ethicist, a mental health expert, and specialists in infectious, parasitic, environmental and chronic diseases.[31]
 In June 2007, the CDC started a website relating to Morgellons, CDC Study of an Unexplained Dermopathy, and by November 2007, the CDC opened an investigation into the condition.[10] Kaiser Permanente, a health-care consortium in Northern California, was chosen to assist with the investigation, which involved skin biopsies from affected people and characterization of foreign material such as fibers or threads obtained from people to determine their potential source.[10][32] The U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the American Academy of Dermatology assisted with pathology.[33] In January 2012, the CDC released the results of the study.[11][12]
 The CDC concluded that 59% of subjects showed cognitive deficits and 63% had evidence of clinically significant symptoms. They stated that 50% of the individuals had drugs in their systems, and 78% reported exposure to solvents (potential skin irritants). The study detected no parasites or mycobacteria in the samples collected from any individuals. Most materials collected from participants' skin were composed of cellulose, likely of cotton origin.[11]
 An active online community and publications ""largely from a single group of investigators"" have supported the notion that Morgellons is an infectious disease, and propose an association with Lyme disease; these findings are contradicted by the much larger studies conducted by the CDC.[5] People usually self-diagnose Morgellons based on information from the internet and find support and confirmation in online communities of people with similar illness beliefs.[34][35][36] In 2006, Waddell and Burke reported the influence of the internet on people self-diagnosed with Morgellons: ""physicians are becoming more and more challenged by the many persons who attempt self-diagnosis on-line. In many cases, these attempts are well-intentioned, yet wrong, and a person's belief in some of these oftentimes unscientific sites online may preclude their trust in the evidence-based approaches and treatment recommendations of their physician.""[37]
 Physician Fidel Vila-Rodriguez wrote in a 2008 editorial that the Internet promotes the spreading and supporting of ""bizarre"" disease beliefs because in online communities, ""a belief is not considered delusional if it is accepted by other members of an individual's culture or subculture"".[35] Robert Bartholomew, a sociologist who has studied the Morgellons phenomenon, states that the ""World Wide Web has become the incubator for mass delusion and it (Morgellons) seems to be a socially transmitted disease over the Internet."" According to this hypothesis, people with delusions of parasitosis and other psychological disorders become convinced they have ""Morgellons"" after reading internet accounts of others with similar symptoms. This phenomenon is known as mass psychogenic illness, where physical symptoms without an organic cause spread to multiple people within the same community or social group.[38] The Dallas Observer writes that Morgellons may be memetically spread via the internet and mass media, and ""[i]f this is the case, then Morgellons is one in a long line of weird diseases that have swept through populations, only to disappear without a trace once public concern subsides"".[17] The article draws parallels to several media-spread mass delusions.
 Dermatologist Caroline Koblenzer specifically faults the Morgellons Research Foundation (MRF) website for misleading people: ""Clearly, as more and more of our patients discover this site (MRF), there will be an ever greater waste of valuable time and resources on fruitless research into fibers, fluffs, irrelevant bacteria, and innocuous worms and insects.""[39] A 2005 Popular Mechanics article stated that Morgellons symptoms are well known and characterized in the context of other disorders, and that ""widespread reports of the strange fibers date back"" only a few years to when the MRF first described them on the Internet.[40] The Los Angeles Times, in an article on Morgellons, notes that ""[t]he recent upsurge in symptoms can be traced directly to the Internet, following the naming of the disease by Mary Leitao, a Pennsylvania mother"".[36]
 In 2008, The Washington Post reported that internet discussions about Morgellons include many conspiracy theories about the cause, including biological warfare, nanotechnology, chemtrails and extraterrestrial life.[9] The Atlantic says it ""even received pop-culture attention"" when it was featured on Criminal Minds, adding that ""Morgellons patients have further alienated themselves from the mainstream medical community"" by ""linking Morgellons to another illness viewed skeptically by most doctors, chronic Lyme disease, and by attacking those who doubt their condition"".[41]

"Netherton syndrome is a severe, autosomal recessive[1] form of ichthyosis associated with mutations in the SPINK5 gene.[2][3] It is named after Earl W. Netherton (1910–1985), an American dermatologist who discovered it in 1958.[4]
 Netherton syndrome is characterized by chronic skin inflammation, universal pruritus (itch), severe dehydration, and stunted growth. Patients with this disorder tend to have a hair shaft defect (trichorrhexis invaginata), also known as ""bamboo hair"". The disrupted skin barrier function in affected individuals also presents a high susceptibility to infection and allergy, leading to the development of scaly, reddish skin similar to atopic dermatitis.[5] In severe cases, these atopic manifestations persist throughout the individual's life, and consequently post-natal mortality rates are high. In less severe cases, this develops into the milder ichthyosis linearis circumflexa.[3]
 Netherton syndrome has recently been characterised as a primary immunodeficiency, which straddles the innate and acquired immune system, much as does Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome.  A group of Netherton patients have been demonstrated to have altered immunoglobulin levels (typically high IgE and low to normal IgG) and immature natural killer cells. These natural killer cells have a reduced lytic function; which can be improved with regular infusions of immunoglobulin (see 'Treatment'); although the mechanism for this is not clear.[6]
 Patients are more prone than healthy people to infections of all types, especially recurrent skin infections with staphylococcus.  They may have more severe infections; but are not as vulnerable to opportunistic pathogens as patients with true natural killer cell deficiency-type SCID.[citation needed]
 Netherton syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with mutations in the SPINK5 gene, which encodes the serine protease inhibitor lympho-epithelial Kazal-type-related inhibitor (LEKTI).[2] These mutations result in a dysfunctional protein that has a reduced capacity to inhibit serine proteases expressed in the skin. Potential endogenous targets of LEKTI include KLK5, KLK7 and KLK14.[7] These enzymes are involved in various aspects of epidermal remodelling, including desquamation, PAR-2 activation and degradation of lipid hydrolases, suggesting a potential mechanism for the development of atopic manifestations characteristic of Netherton syndrome.[8]
 Disease severity is determined by the level of LEKTI expression and, consequently, serine protease activity. Complete SPINK5 gene deletions have been linked to severe cases, while mutations which induce alternate splicing or create premature stop codons may lead to varying levels of severity.[8] Furthermore, LEKTI-knockout mice exhibit a phenotype similar to Netherton syndrome in humans.[5]
 There is no known cure at the moment but there are several things that can be done to relieve the symptoms. Moisturising products are very helpful to minimize the scaling/cracking, and anti-infective treatments are useful when appropriate because the skin is very susceptible to infection. Extra protein in the diet during childhood is also beneficial, to replace that which is lost through the previously mentioned ""leaky"" skin.[citation needed]
 Steroid and retinoid products have been proven ineffective against Netherton syndrome, and may in fact make things worse for the affected individual.[citation needed]
 Intravenous immunoglobulin has become established as the treatment of choice in Netherton syndrome.[6]  This therapy reduces infection; enables improvement and even resolution of the skin and hair abnormalities, and dramatically improves quality of life of the patients; although exactly how it achieves this is not known.  Given this; it is possible that the reason Netherton syndrome usually is not very severe at or shortly after birth is due to a protective effect of maternal antibodies; which cross the placenta but wane by four to six months.[citation needed]

 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the term for a range of conditions caused by a build-up of fat in the liver. It's usually seen in people who are overweight or obese. Early-stage NAFLD does not usually cause any harm, but it can lead to serious liver damage, including cirrhosis, if it gets worse. Having high levels of fat in your liver is also associated with an increased risk of serious health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney disease. If you already have diabetes, NAFLD increases your chance of developing heart problems. If detected and managed at an early stage, it's possible to stop NAFLD getting worse and reduce the amount of fat in your liver. NAFLD develops in 4 main stages. Most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realising it. In a small number of cases, it can progress and eventually lead to liver damage if not detected and managed. The main stages of NAFLD are: It can take years for fibrosis or cirrhosis to develop. It's important to make lifestyle changes to prevent the condition getting worse. You're at an increased risk of NAFLD if you: But NAFLD has been diagnosed in people without any of these risk factors, including young children. Although it's very similar to alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), NAFLD is not caused by drinking too much alcohol. There are not usually any symptoms of NAFLD in the early stages. You probably will not know you have it unless it's diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason. Occasionally, people with NASH or fibrosis (more advanced stages of NAFLD) may experience: If cirrhosis (the most advanced stage) develops, you can get more severe symptoms, such as yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice), itchy skin, and swelling in the legs, ankles, feet or tummy (oedema). See a GP urgently or call 111 if you have any of these symptoms and have a liver condition. NAFLD is often diagnosed after a blood test called a liver function test produces an abnormal result and other liver conditions, such as hepatitis, are ruled out. But blood tests do not always pick up NAFLD. The condition may also be spotted during an ultrasound scan of your tummy. This is a type of scan where sound waves are used to create an image of the inside of your body. If you're diagnosed with NAFLD, further tests may be needed to determine which stage you have. This may involve a special blood test or having another type of ultrasound scan (Fibroscan). Some people may also need a biopsy, where a small sample of liver tissue is taken using a needle so it can be analysed in a laboratory. Children and young people with an increased risk of NAFLD (those with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome) should have an ultrasound scan of their liver every 3 years. Other tests you may have include a CT scan or MRI scan. Most people with NAFLD will not develop any serious problems, but if you're diagnosed with the condition it's a good idea to take steps to stop it getting any worse. There's currently no specific medication for NAFLD, but making healthy lifestyle choices can help. Treatment also may be recommended for associated conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol) or complications. You may be advised to have regular appointments with your doctor to check your liver function and look for signs of any new problems. There's not currently any medicine that can treat NAFLD, but various medicines can be useful in managing the problems associated with the condition. For example, your doctor may recommend medicine to treat high blood pressure, treat high cholesterol, treat type 2 diabetes and treat obesity. If you develop severe cirrhosis and your liver stops working properly, you may need to be put on the waiting list for a liver transplant. Or it may be possible to have a transplant using a section of liver removed from a living donor. As the liver can regenerate itself, both the transplanted section and the remaining section of the donor's liver are able to regrow to a normal size. Adopting a healthy lifestyle is the main way of managing NAFLD. For example, it can help to:  NAFLD is not caused by alcohol, but drinking may make it worse. It's therefore advisable to cut down or stop drinking alcohol.

"Drinking too much alcohol over a long period of time can cause a buildup of fat in your liver, a condition known as alcohol-associated liver disease. This disease can eventually lead to scarring of liver tissue, known as cirrhosis. Liver function can also decrease depending on how much scarring occurs.  Fatty tissue can also build up in your liver if you drink little or no alcohol. This is known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Severe forms of NAFLD can also lead to cirrhosis. NAFLD and alcoholic-associated liver disease fall under the umbrella term of fatty liver disease, but their causes and treatments differ. Read on for more information on NAFLD, including how to manage it with lifestyle changes. There are two types of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: Nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Currently, researchers aren’t sure why an individual develops one or the other. It’s possible to be diagnosed with one form, and then later the other. When you are diagnosed with NAFL, you have fat in your liver, but little to no inflammation and no liver damage. While this condition can cause pain due to enlargement of the liver, it typically doesn’t cause liver damage. NASH is a more serious form of NAFLD. If you are diagnosed with NASH, you most likely have inflammation in the liver in addition to fat, and may even have liver damage. This damage can cause scarring in the liver. Untreated NASH may eventually lead to cirrhosis, which when left untreated may lead to liver cancer. In many cases of NAFLD, there are no noticeable symptoms. When symptoms are present, they usually include: The exact causes of NAFLD aren’t well understood. Currently, researchers believe genes, certain health conditions, diet, and the digestive system may all play a role. While some individuals who are diagnosed with NAFLD have no previous risk factors, there are some lifestyle factors that can increase the likelihood of a NAFLD diagnosis. One of the biggest risk factors for developing NAFLD is living with obesity.  Additional risk factors include health issues that often occur along with obesity, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome (a group of traits and conditions linked to living with obesity). If you’re diagnosed with more than one of these health issues, your chances of developing NAFLD go up. Other risk factors include: NAFLD usually has no symptoms. The condition is typically diagnosed after a blood test finds higher-than-normal levels of liver enzymes. A standard blood test could reveal this result.  High levels of liver enzymes could also suggest other liver diseases. Your doctor will need to rule out other conditions before diagnosing NAFLD. If NAFLD is suspected, your doctor may look for physical symptoms like signs of insulin resistance (darker skin patches over your knees, knuckles, and elbows), and signs of cirrhosis (ascites and/or muscle loss).  An ultrasound of the liver can help reveal excess fat in the liver. Another type of ultrasound, called transient elastography, measures your liver’s stiffness. Greater stiffness suggests greater scarring. If these tests are inconclusive, your doctor may recommend a liver biopsy. In this test, the doctor removes a small sample of liver tissue with a needle inserted through your abdomen. The sample is studied in a lab for signs of inflammation and scarring.  Even though the side effects of NAFLD often go unnoticed, if you have symptoms such as right-side abdominal pain, jaundice, or swelling, see a doctor as soon as you can. The main risk of NAFLD is cirrhosis, which can limit your liver’s ability to do its job. Once you’ve been diagnosed with cirrhosis, it can’t be reversed, but there are treatment options that can slow it down, or stop it.  If cirrhosis is not slowed or stopped, it can result in liver failure, which means your liver can no longer do its job. This may mean you’ll need a liver transplant. Liver cancer is another possible complication of untreated cirrhosis.  There is no specific medication or procedure to treat NAFLD. Instead, your doctor will most likely recommend several important lifestyle changes. These include: It’s also important to follow up on doctor appointments and report any new symptoms. If you’ve been diagnosed with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, sticking to recommended lifestyle changes may be enough to preserve good liver health for a long time. You may even be able to reverse liver damage in the earliest stages of the disease.  Even if you don’t feel any symptoms from NAFLD, that doesn’t mean liver scarring isn’t occurring. If you believe you may be at risk for developing this condition, your doctor can help you figure out if you need any additional testing done.  The good news is that the same lifestyle choices that can manage NAFLD can also help manage, or reverse, other health issues such as type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and metabolic syndrome.

 Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),[a] is a type of chronic liver disease. 
This condition is diagnosed when there is excessive fat build-up in the liver (hepatic steatosis), and at least one metabolic risk factor.[1][3][4] When there is also increased alcohol intake, the term MetALD, or metabolic dysfunction and alcohol associated/related liver disease is used, and differentiated from alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) where alcohol is the predominant cause of the steatotic liver disease.[1][12]  The terms non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, now MASH) have been used to describe different severities, the latter indicating the presence of further liver inflammation.[4][5][8] NAFL is less dangerous than NASH and usually does not progress to it,[4] but this progression may eventually lead to complications, such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver failure, and cardiovascular disease.[4][13]
 Obesity and type 2 diabetes are strong risk factors for MASLD.[7] Other risks include being overweight, metabolic syndrome (defined as at least three of the five following medical conditions: abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high serum triglycerides, and low serum HDL cholesterol), a diet high in fructose, and older age.[4][8] Obtaining a sample of the liver after excluding other potential causes of fatty liver can confirm the diagnosis.[3][7][8]
 Treatment for MASLD is weight loss by dietary changes and exercise;[5][14][15] bariatric surgery can improve or resolve severe cases.[14][16] There is some evidence for SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, pioglitazone, and vitamin E in the treatment of MASLD.[17][18] In March 2024, resmetirom was the first drug approved by the FDA for MASH.[19] Those with MASH have a 2.6% increased risk of dying per year.[5]
 MASLD is the most common liver disorder in the world; about 25% of people have it.[20] It is very common in developed nations, such as the United States, and affected about 75 to 100 million Americans in 2017.[21][22][23][24] Over 90% of obese, 60% of diabetic, and up to 20% of normal-weight people develop MASLD.[25][26] MASLD was the leading cause of chronic liver disease[24][25] and the second most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States and Europe in 2017.[14] MASLD affects about 20 to 25% of people in Europe.[16] In the United States, estimates suggest that 30% to 40% of adults have MASLD, and about 3% to 12% of adults have MASH.[4] The annual economic burden was about US$103 billion in the United States in 2016.[25]
 An abnormal accumulation of fat in the liver in the absence of secondary causes of fatty liver, such as significant alcohol use, viral hepatitis, or medications that can induce fatty liver, was the definition of NAFLD.[20]  However, the term MASLD accepts there may be other conditions present, but focuses on the metabolic abnormalities contributing to the disorder.[1][12] MASLD encompasses a continuum of liver abnormalities, from metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver (MASL, simple steatosis) to Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). These diseases begin with fatty accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis). A liver can remain fatty without disturbing liver function (MASL), but by various mechanisms and possible insults to the liver, it may also progress into steatohepatitis (MASH), a state in which steatosis is combined with inflammation and sometimes fibrosis.[1] MASH can then lead to complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.[3][5][27]
 The new name, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), was proposed after 70% of a panel of experts expressed support for this name.[1]  This new name was adopted in 2023.[1][10]
 People with MASLD often have no noticeable symptoms, and it is often only detected during routine blood tests or unrelated abdominal imaging or liver biopsy.[5][27] In some cases, it can cause symptoms related to liver dysfunction such as fatigue, malaise, and dull right-upper-quadrant abdominal discomfort. Mild yellow discoloration of the skin may occur, although this is rare.[28] MASH can severely impair liver function, leading to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer.[5]
 The condition is strongly associated with or caused by type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome (defined as at least three of the five following medical conditions: abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high serum triglycerides, and low serum high-density lipoprotein). It is also associated with hormonal disorders (panhypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, polycystic ovary syndrome), persistently elevated transaminases, increasing age, and hypoxia caused by obstructive sleep apnea; some of these conditions predict disease progression.[3][7][13][29][21][25][30]
 Most normal-weight people with MASLD (""lean MASLD"") have impaired insulin sensitivity, are sedentary, and have increased cardiovascular disease risk and increased liver lipid levels. These are the consequences of a decreased capacity for storing fat and reduced mitochondrial function in fat and increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis.[7][25] A recent systematic review reported an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection in MASLD patients, but no difference in mortality was observed between MASLD and non-MASLD patients.[31]
 Two-thirds of families with a history of diabetes type 2 report more than one family member having MASLD. There is a higher risk of fibrosis for family members where someone was diagnosed with MASH.[27] Asian populations are more susceptible to metabolic syndrome and MASLD than their western counterparts.[7] Hispanic persons have a higher prevalence of MASLD than white individuals, whereas the lowest prevalence is observed in black individuals.[25] MASLD is twice as prevalent in men as in women,[5] which might be explained by lower levels of estrogen in men.[32]
 Genetic variations in two genes are associated with MASLD: non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PNPLA3 and TM6SF2. Both correlate with MASLD presence and severity, but their roles for diagnosis remain unclear.[25][33] Although NAFLD has a genetic component, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) does not recommend screening family members as there is not enough confirmation of heritability,[5] although there is some evidence from familial aggregation and twin studies.[25]
 According to the Asia-Pacific Working Group (APWG) on MASLD, overnutrition is a major factor of MASLD and MASH, particularly for lean MASLD.[7] Diet composition and quantity, in particular omega-6 fatty acid and fructose, have important roles in disease progression from MASL to MASH and fibrosis.[34][35] Choline deficiency can lead to the development of MASLD.[36]
 Higher consumption of processed, red, and organ meats have been associated with higher risk of developing MASLD.[37][38][39] Some research also suggests eggs are also associated with developing MASLD.[40][41] On the other hand, studies have found healthful plant foods such as legumes and nuts, to be associated with a lower risk of developing MASLD.[42][43] Two different studies have found healthy plant-based diets rich in healthy plant foods and low in animal foods to be associated with a lower risk of developing MASLD, even after adjusting for BMI.[44][45]
 Habitual snoring may be a risk factor for MASLD. Severe snoring often signals the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSAS), a much more serious breathing condition. Blockage or narrowing of the airways, even temporarily, can cause the body to experience lowered oxygen levels in the blood. This in turn may cause a variety of changes within the body such as tissue inflammation, increased insulin resistance, and liver injury.[46] A prospective cohort study found the association between habitual snoring and MASLD development to be significant, and the trend was noted to be most prominent in lean individuals.[47]
 The primary characteristic of MASLD is the accumulation of lipids in the liver, largely in the form of triglycerides.[20] However, the mechanisms by which triglycerides accumulate and the reasons that accumulation can lead to liver dysfunction are complex and incompletely understood.[20][48][49] MASLD can include steatosis along with varied signs of liver injury: either lobular or portal inflammation (a form of liver injury) or ballooning degeneration. Similarly, NASH can include histological features such as portal inflammation, polymorphonuclear cell infiltrates, Mallory bodies, apoptotic bodies, clear vacuolated nuclei, microvesicular steatosis, megamitochondria, and perisinusoidal fibrosis.[16]  Hepatocyte death via apoptosis or necroptosis is increased in MASH compared with simple steatosis, and inflammation is a hallmark of MASH.[33]  The degree of inflammation can be correlated to the number of inflammatory foci. Various definitions exist for an inflammatory focus, but one defines it as the presence of more than four mononuclear cells in close proximity inside the hepatic parenchyma.[50]
 One debated mechanism proposes that hepatic steatosis progresses to steatosis with inflammation following some further injury, or second hit. Oxidative stress, hormonal imbalances, and mitochondrial abnormalities are potential causes of this ""second hit"" phenomenon.[27] A further nutrigenomics model named multiple hit extends the second hit model, suggesting that multiple disease biomarkers and factors such as genes and nutrition influence NAFLD and NASH progression. This model attempts to use these factors to predict the impact of lifestyle changes and genetics for the evolution of the NAFLD pathology.[51] Many researchers describe NAFLD as a multisystem disease, as it impacts and is influenced by organs and regulatory pathways other than the liver.[52][53][54]
 The accumulation of senescent cells in the liver is seen in persons with NAFLD.[55] In mice, liver senescent hepatocytes result in increased liver fat deposition.[55] Treatment of NAFLD mice with senolytic agents has been shown to reduce hepatic steatosis.[55]
 Based on gene knockout studies in murine models, it has been suggested that, among many other pathogenic factors, TGF beta signals may be crucially involved in promoting the progression of NASH.[56]
 Non-alcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver disease share similar histological features, which suggests that they might share common pathogenic pathways. Fructose can cause liver inflammation and addiction similarly to ethanol by using similar metabolic pathways, unlike glucose. Therefore, some researchers argue that non-alcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver diseases are more alike than previously thought.[34][57] Furthermore, high fructose consumption promotes fat accumulation in the liver by stimulating de novo lipogenesis in the liver and reducing the beta-oxidation of fat.[20] Unlike the sugar glucose, the enzyme fructokinase rapidly metabolizes fructose. This leads to a decreased level of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP).[20] The decrease in ATP increases oxidative stress and impairments in proper protein synthesis and mitochondrial function in the liver.[20]
 Insulin resistance contributes to the accumulation of toxic fat in the liver in several ways. First, it promotes the release of free fatty acids (FFAs) from adipose tissue into the blood. Typically, adipose tissue stores lipids in the form of triglycerides, slowly releasing them into the bloodstream when insulin is low. In insulin-resistant adipose tissue, such as in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, more triglycerides are broken down into FFAs and released into the bloodstream, promoting uptake by the liver.[20] Second, insulin promotes the production of new FFAs in the liver via de novo lipogenesis; this production of liver fats continues to be stimulated by insulin, even when other tissues are insulin-resistant.[20] These FFAs are combined back into triglycerides in the liver, forming the major constituent of the accumulated fat in the liver.[20] The three sources of free fatty acids that contribute to liver triglyceride accumulation include FFAs circulating in the bloodstream (59%), FFAs derived from carbohydrates such as fructose and glucose (26%), and diet (14%).[20] Despite the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver, they are not directly toxic to liver tissue.[20] Instead, alteration of the profile of the other lipid subtypes present in the liver, such as diacylglycerols, phospholipids, ceramides, and free cholesterol, have a more significant role in the pathogenesis of MASLD.[20]
 Once MASLD progresses in severity to the point of NASH, this promotes further insulin resistance in the adipose tissue and liver, which results in a harmful cycle of insulin resistance, liver fat accumulation, and inflammation.[20] Adipose tissue dysfunction also decreases secretion of the insulin-sensitizing adipokine adiponectin in people with NAFLD.[20] Adiponectin has several properties that protect the liver.[20] These properties include improved liver fat metabolism, decreased de novo lipogenesis, decreased glucose production in the liver, anti-inflammatory properties, and anti-fibrotic properties.[20] Skeletal muscle insulin resistance may also play a role in MASLD. Insulin-resistant skeletal muscle is not as efficient at taking up glucose from the bloodstream after a meal.[20] This inefficient glucose uptake promotes the redistribution of consumed carbohydrates from glucose destined for use in glycogen stores in the skeletal muscles to being used as a substrate for de novo lipogenesis in the liver.[20]
 Disruptions in the intestinal microbiota seem to influence NAFLD risk in several ways.[58] People with NASH can have elevated levels of blood ethanol and Pseudomonadota (which produce alcohol), with dysbiosis proposed as a mechanism for this elevation.[59] Alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota may influence NAFLD risk in several ways. These changes appear to increase the permeability of intestinal tissue, thereby facilitating increased liver exposure to harmful substances (e.g., translocated bacteria, bacterial toxins, and inflammatory chemical signals). The increased transport of these harmful substances to the liver promotes liver inflammation, enhances nutrient and calorie absorption, and alters choline metabolism.[59][60][61] Higher levels of intestinal bacteria that produce butyrate may be protective.[59]
 Excessive macronutrient intake contributes to gut inflammation and perturbation of homeostasis, and micronutrients may also be involved.[62] In addition to reducing weight and risk factors, lifestyle changes may prompt positive changes in the gut microbiota.[63] In particular, diet diversity may play a role that was overlooked in animal studies, since they often compare a Western high-fat, low-diversity diet against a low-fat but higher-diversity chow.[64] The health benefits after bariatric surgery may also involve changes in the gut microbiota by increasing gut permeability.[64]
 NAFLD was defined by the presence of excess fat in the liver that cannot be explained by another factor, such as excessive alcohol use (>21 standard drinks/week for men and >14 for women in the USA; >30 g daily for men and >20 g for women in UK and EU, >140 g/week for men and >70 g/week for women in Asia-Pacific), liver injury caused by drugs or toxins or viruses, nutritional deficiency, or endocrine conditions. In practice, diagnosis was often made simply based on the clinical presentation and a lack of high-volume alcohol consumption reported by the patient, but this is an unreliable method of diagnosis.[3][5][7][65][16][66]
 NAFLD comprises two histological categories: NAFL, and the more aggressive form NASH. The presence of at least 5% fatty liver is common to both NAFL and NASH, but the features of substantial lobular inflammation and hepatocyte injuries such as ballooning or Mallory hyaline only occur in NASH. The majority of NAFL cases show minimal or no inflammation.[3][5][7] Pericentral and perisinusoidal fibrosis occur more often in adult-onset NASH, whereas portal fibrosis is more common in children with the disorder. NASH represents a more advanced stage of NAFL and is associated with poor outcomes such as cardiovascular events, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. ICD-11 does not use the term NAFL as it was deemed confusing with the family of disorders NAFLD. The preferred descriptions are instead: NAFLD without NASH or simple steatosis and ""NASH"". Also, the modifier with or without fibrosis or cirrhosis completes the diagnostic description.[3][7]
 Following the renaming of NAFLD to MASLD,[1][10] these definitions are being updated.
 Liver function tests may be abnormal, but they often remain within the normal range even in advanced disease.[13][65][25] Other blood tests that may be useful to confirm the diagnosis include erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum glucose, and albumin. Because the liver is important for making proteins used in blood clotting, coagulation-related studies are often carried out, especially the prothrombin time. In people with fatty liver with associated inflammatory injury (steatohepatitis) blood tests are usually used to rule out certain types of viral hepatitis and autoimmune diseases. Low thyroid activity is more prevalent in people with NASH, which would be detected by determining the thyroid-stimulating hormone.[67] Some biomarker-based blood tests have been developed and may be useful for diagnosis.[68]
 Although blood tests cannot diagnose MASLD, circulating serum biomarkers of liver fibrosis can give moderate estimates in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. The ratio of the transaminase liver enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelets in the blood, known as the AST/platelet ratio index (APRI score), and Fibrotest are recommended as the preferred noninvasive tests for cirrhosis by the Asian-Pacific Association for Study of the Liver (APASL).[69] Several other scores such as FIB-4 score and NAFLD fibrosis score can also reflect the burden of the fibrosis in the liver,[70] and previous studies have confirmed that these scores can predict future development of mortality and liver cancer.[71]
 A liver ultrasound scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can diagnose steatosis,[72] but not fibrosis, and confirmation of early cirrhosis detection by ultrasound by other diagnostic methods is recommended.[69] The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) recommends screening for steatosis whenever NAFLD is suspected as this is a strong predictor of the disease evolution and predicts future type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular events, and hypertension.[16] These non-invasive methods can be used for NAFLD screening but are not accepted as a substitute for liver biopsy in NAFLD nor NASH clinical trials, as only a liver biopsy can define liver pathology.[7][14]
 Ultrasound presented average sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing the disease in children, while in the adult population, sensitivity and specificity were significantly higher. Proton density fat fraction magnetic resonance imaging has been increasingly used for the diagnosis of steatosis in pediatric patients.[citation needed]
 Ultrasound elastography is an effective tool for staging liver fibrosis and discriminating NASH in children.[73]
 Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are more accurate in detecting cirrhosis than conventional ultrasound.[69] Transient elastography is recommended for the initial assessment of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis and helps to predict complications and prognosis, but the interpretation of results is carefully weighed in the presence of limiting factors such as steatosis, high BMI, low amount of hepatic fibrosis, narrow spaces between the ribs, and portal hypertension. Transient elastography is not a substitute for liver biopsy.[69]
 Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is an established method that can accurately assess hepatic fibrosis and is recommended by the APASL, AGA, ACR and AASLD.[69] MRE possesses excellent accuracy to detect fibrosis in NAFLD regardless of BMI and inflammation, and is suggested as a more reliable alternative to diagnose NAFLD and its progression to NASH compared to ultrasound and blood tests.[28][33][74][75]
 A liver biopsy (tissue examination) is the only test widely accepted (gold standard) as definitively diagnosing and distinguishing NAFLD (including NAFL and NASH) from other forms of liver disease and can be used to assess the severity of the inflammation and resultant fibrosis. However, since most people affected by NAFLD are likely to be asymptomatic, liver biopsy presents too high a risk for routine diagnosis, so other methods are preferred, such as liver ultrasonography or liver MRI. For young people, guidelines recommend liver ultrasonography, but biopsy remains the best evidence.[5][7][65][28] Liver biopsy is also the gold standard to detect hepatic fibrosis and assess its progression.[69] Routine liver function blood tests are not sensitive enough to detect MASLD, and biopsy is the only procedure that can reliably differentiate NAFL from NASH.[16]
 There are several liver biopsy techniques available to obtain liver tissue. Percutaneous liver biopsy remains the most common practice. Biopsies can also be performed via the transvenous route, either during surgery or by laparoscopy, especially for people with contraindications to a percutaneous approach. The liver biopsy can also be image-guided, in real-time or not, which is recommended for some clinical situations such as people with known intra-hepatic lesions, previous intra-abdominal surgery who may have adhesions, a small liver that is difficult to percuss, obese people and people with evident ascites. Vital signs must be monitored frequently afterward (at least every 15 minutes in the hour following the biopsy).[69]
 According to AASLD guidelines, a liver biopsy may be considered in people with NAFLD who are at increased risk of having steatohepatitis with or without advanced fibrosis, but only when all other competing chronic liver diseases are excluded (such as alcoholic liver disease). The presence of metabolic syndrome, NAFLD Fibrosis Score (FIB-4), or liver stiffness (as measured by Vibration-controlled transient elastography or MRE) can identify the individuals who are at higher risk of steatohepatitis or advanced fibrosis.[5]
 The AASLD and ICD-11 consider that clinically useful pathology reporting distinguishes ""between NAFL (steatosis), NAFL with inflammation and NASH (steatosis with lobular and portal inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning)"" with the presence or absence of fibrosis being described and optionally comment on severity.[5][7] The EASL recommends the Fatty Liver Inhibition of Progression (FLIP) algorithm to grade the ballooning and classify MASLD-associated liver injury, and the use of the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) to grade the severity of NASH rather than for its diagnosis. They also consider the steatosis, activity, and fibrosis (SAF) score to be an accurate and reproducible scoring system.[16] The AASLD recommends the use of the NAS scoring system with or without the SAF score if deemed appropriate.[5] The Asia-Pacific Working Group disadvises the use of NAS, as it is considered uninformative for NAFLD and inappropriate to diagnose NASH.[14]
 For liver fibrosis assessment, percutaneous liver biopsy, with or without image guidance, is contraindicated in uncooperative people.[69] Transjugular liver biopsy is indicated for any person with diffuse liver disease who needs a biopsy but has a contraindication to percutaneous biopsy or needs a hemodynamic evaluation for diagnostic purposes. A transvenous liver biopsy is recommended instead of a percutaneous approach in people with clinically evident ascites, although percutaneous biopsy is an acceptable alternative approach after the removal of ascites.[69]
 MASLD warrants treatment regardless of whether the affected person is overweight or not.[7] MASLD is a preventable cause of death.[24] Guidelines are available from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and the Asia-Pacific Working Party on NAFLD.[5][7][14][65][16][77][78]
 Weight loss is the most effective treatment for NAFLD. A loss of 4% to 10% body weight is recommended, with 10% to 40% weight loss completely reversing NASH without cirrhosis. A structured weight loss program helps people with MASLD lose more weight compared with advice alone. This type of program also leads to improvements in NAFLD measured using blood tests, ultrasound, imaging, or liver biopsies. Although fibrosis improves with lifestyle interventions and weight loss, there is limited evidence for cirrhosis improvement.[7][14][77][79]
 A combination of improved diet and exercise, rather than either alone, appears to best help manage NAFLD and reduce insulin resistance.[5][15][16][80][81] Motivational support, such as with cognitive behavioral therapy, is helpful, as most people with MASLD do not perceive their condition as a disease, and thus have a low motivation to change.[5][13][65][16][48]
 Higher-intensity behavioral weight loss therapies (diet and exercise combined) may produce more weight loss than lower-intensity ones. A 2019 systematic review suggested a change of guidelines to recommend these therapies for MASLD management. Weight loss is associated with improvements in biomarkers, MASLD grade, and reduced chances of NASH, but its effect on long-term health was not known.[79]
 2021 meta-analyses of trials over periods of 1 to 28 months found limited evidence to indicate that lifestyle modifications and nutritional supplementation have an effect on mortality, liver cirrhosis, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, and hepatocellular carcinoma in people with non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease; authors said that it was unlikely that differences in clinical outcomes would become apparent in trials with less than 5 years to 10 years of follow‐up, and that sample sizes needed to be much larger than had been used.[82][83]
 Treatment of NAFLD typically involves counseling to improve nutrition and calorie restriction.[13][77][84] People with NAFLD can benefit from a moderate to low-carbohydrate diet and a low-fat diet.[13][85] The Mediterranean diet also showed promising results in a 6-week study with a reduction of NASH induced inflammation and fibrosis, independently from weight loss.[13][16][81][86] Tentative evidence supports dietary interventions in individuals with fatty liver who are not overweight.[87]
 The EASL recommends energy restriction of 500–1000 kcal per week less than the normal daily diet, a target of 7–10% weight loss for obese/overweight MASLD, a low- to moderate-fat, and moderate- to high-carbohydrate diet, or a low-carbohydrate ketogenic or high-protein diet such as the Mediterranean diet, and avoiding all beverages and food containing fructose.[16]
 Alcohol is an aggravating factor, and the AASLD recommends that people with NAFLD or NASH avoid alcohol consumption.[5][13][65][88] The EASL allows alcohol consumption below 30g/day for men and 20g/day for women.[16] The role of coffee consumption for NAFLD treatment is unclear though some studies indicate that regular coffee consumption may have protective effects.[16][89][90]
 Herbal compounds such as silymarin (a milk thistle seed extract),[91] curcumin, a turmeric extract,[92] and green tea appear to improve NAFLD biomarkers and reduce the grade of NAFLD.[54] Studies suggest an association between microscopic organisms that inhabit the gut (microbiota) and MASLD. Reviews reported the use of probiotics and synbiotics (combinations of probiotics and prebiotics) were associated with improvement in liver-specific markers of hepatic inflammation, measurements of liver stiffness, and steatosis in persons with MASLD.[93][94]
 Vitamin E does not improve established liver fibrosis in those with MASLD but seems to improve certain markers of liver function and reduces inflammation and fattiness of the liver in some people with MASLD.[5][13][65] The Asia-Pacific Work Group advises that Vitamin E may improve liver condition and aminotransferase levels, but only in adults without diabetes or cirrhosis who have NASH.[14] The NICE guidelines recommend Vitamin E as an option for children and adults with NAFLD with advanced liver fibrosis, regardless of whether the person has diabetes mellitus.[13][65]
 Weight loss may improve MASLD and is recommended particularly for obese or overweight people;[95][96][97] similar physical activities and diets are advisable for overweight people with MASLD as for other obese and overweight people.[65][81] Although physical activity is less important for weight loss than dietary adaptations (to reduce caloric intake),[48] the NICE advises physical activity to reduce liver fat even if there is no overall bodyweight reduction.[13][65] Weight loss, through exercise or diet, is the most effective way to reduce liver fat and help NASH and fibrosis remission.[48] Exercise alone can prevent or reduce hepatic steatosis, but it remains unknown whether it can improve all other aspects of the liver; hence a combined approach with diet and exercise is advised.[5][15] Aerobic exercise may be more effective than resistance training, although there are contradictory results.[13][98] Vigorous training is preferable to moderate training, as only the high-intensity exercise reduced the chances of MASLD developing into NASH or advanced fibrosis.[13][99] The EASL recommends between 150 and 200 min/week in 3 to 5 sessions of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or resistance training. Since both effectively reduce liver fat, a pragmatic approach to the choice of physical activity that accounts for the individual's preferences for what they can maintain in the long-term is preferred. Any engagement in physical activity or increase over previous levels is better than remaining sedentary.[16]
 While many treatments appear to improve biochemical markers such as alanine transaminase levels, most do not reverse histological abnormalities or improve outcomes.[5][14][100][needs update] Treatment with medications is primarily aimed at improving liver disease and is generally limited to those with biopsy-proven NASH and fibrosis.[5][65][16]
 Insulin sensitizers (metformin and thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone) are not specifically recommended for MASLD as they do not directly improve the liver condition. They can be indicated for diabetic individuals, after a careful assessment of risks, to reduce insulin resistance and risks of complications.[5][14] Indeed, the side effects associated with thiazolidinedione medications, which include osteopenia, increased fracture risk, fluid retention, congestive heart failure, bladder cancer, and long-term weight gain, have limited their adoption.[13][101][102] Due to these side effects, the AASLD recommends the use of pioglitazone only for individuals with biopsy-proven NASH, and the Asia-Pacific Work Group recommends them only for individuals with MASLD with known diabetic issues. However, the AASLD advises against the use of metformin as studies were inconclusive about the improvement of the liver's histological condition. Although there was an improvement in insulin resistance and serum aminotransferases, this did not translate into NASH improvements.[5] The NICE provides similar guidelines to the AASLD regarding pioglitazone and recommends it be administered in secondary care to adults with advanced liver fibrosis irrespective of whether or not they have diabetes.[65]
 Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1s) are at least as effective as pioglitazone and Vitamin E and significantly reduce steatosis, ballooning necrosis, lobular inflammation, and fibrosis according to a 2023 systematic review.[103] Dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists appear to be effective treatments; tirzepatide was more effective than placebo for resolution of MASH without worsening of fibrosis in patients with biopsy-confirmed MASH and stage F2 or F3 (moderate or severe) fibrosis when given once-weekly for 52 weeks,[104] while survodutide decreased liver fat content and improved fibrosis compared to placebo, although with more frequent adverse effects of nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting[105]
 SGLT-2 inhibitors have also found success in some clinical trials, and proved more beneficial than GLP-1 agonists in the only head-to-head-trial completed as of 2024.[17]
 Statin medications appear to improve liver histology and markers of liver biochemistry in people with MASLD. Since people with NAFLD are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, statin treatment is indicated. People with NAFLD are not at higher risk for serious liver injury from statins, according to AASLD and EASL. However, even if statins are safe to use in people with NASH cirrhosis, the AASLD suggests avoiding them in people with decompensated cirrhosis.[5][16][106] Guidelines recommend statins to treat dyslipidemia for people with MASLD. According to NICE guidelines, statins can continue unless liver enzyme levels double within three months of starting statins.[65] Treatment with pentoxifylline is not recommended.[14]
 Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce liver fat and improve blood lipid profile but do not seem to improve liver histology (fibrosis, cirrhosis, cancer).[14] The NICE does not recommend omega-3 fatty acid supplementation since randomized trials were inconclusive.[13][65] Previous systematic reviews found that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in those with NAFLD/NASH using doses of one gram daily or more (median dose four grams/day with median treatment duration six months) has been associated with improvements in liver fat.[48][107] According to AASLD guidelines, ""omega-3 fatty acids should not be used as a specific treatment of NAFLD or NASH, but they may be considered to treat hypertriglyceridemia for patients with NAFLD"".[5]
 Resmetirom (Rezdiffra) was approved for medical use in the United States in March 2024 for the treatment of noncirrhotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.[108][109]
 Aspirin, 81 mg for 6 months, significantly reduced hepatic fat quantity compared with placebo among 40 randomized participants with MASLD in a 6-month, phase 2, randomized, double-blind clinical trial conducted at a single hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. [110]
 Bariatric surgery is an effective method for obese and diabetic individuals with MASLD to induce weight loss and reduce or resolve NASH inflammation, including fibrosis, and improve longevity.[13][14][16][48][111][112] For the AASLD, bariatric surgery can be considered only for NASH on a case-by-case basis by an experienced bariatric surgery program.[5] Indeed, some individuals might develop new or worsened features of MASLD.[112]
 About 92% of people with MASLD saw an improvement in steatosis and 70% a complete resolution after bariatric surgery.[113]
 A preoperative diet such as a low-calorie diet or a very-low-calorie diet is usually recommended to reduce liver volume by 16–20%. Preoperative weight loss is the only factor associated with postoperative weight loss.[114][115] Preoperative weight loss can reduce operative time and hospital stay,[114][116][117] although there is insufficient evidence whether preoperative weight loss reduces long-term morbidity or complications.[117][118] Weight loss and decreases in liver size may be independent of the amount of calorie restriction.[115]
 The APWG on MASLD recommends bariatric surgery as a treatment option for those with class II obesity (BMI >32.5 kg/m2 for Asians, 35 kg/m2 for Caucasians). They consider its effects on improving liver-related complications as unproven yet, but it effectively increases longevity by improving cardiovascular factors.[14]
 Surgery carries more risks for individuals with NASH cirrhosis, with a review estimating overall morbidity to be 21%. For people with MASLD who have undifferentiated cirrhosis, the APWG recommends an investigation to determine the cause of the cirrhosis as well as the person's liver function and whether they have portal hypertension.[14]
 Cardiovascular system screening is considered mandatory by the EASL, as MASLD outcomes often result in cardiovascular complications,[16] which can manifest as subclinical atherosclerosis, the cause of the majority of MASLD-related deaths.[52][119] People with MASLD are at high risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and ""aggressive modification of cardiovascular disease risk factors is warranted in all patients"" according to AASLD.[5]
 The AASLD further recommends for people with a cirrhotic NASH to be systematically screened for gastric and esophageal varices and liver cancer. They do not recommend routine liver biopsies and screening for liver cancer for non-cirrhotic people with NASH, but such screening sometimes occurs on a case-by-case basis.[5]
 Also, people with MASLD may be considered for screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) and gastroesophageal varices. The NICE advises regular screening of NAFLD for advanced liver fibrosis every three years to adults and every two years for children using the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) blood test.[65] Follow-up is recommended for people with obesity and insulin resistance using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). People with NASH with fibrosis and hypertension merit closer monitoring as there is a higher risk of disease progression.[16]
 MASLD is the second most common indication for liver transplantation in the US and Europe as of 2017.[14]
 For people with NASH and end-stage liver disease, liver failure, or liver cancer, liver transplantation is an accepted procedure according to the EASL.[16] People with NASH cirrhosis NASH who are being considered for a liver transplant warrant systematic evaluation for cardiovascular diseases (whether the symptoms are apparent or not).[5]
 The overall survival is comparable to transplantation following other diseases.[14][16] People with NASH cirrhosis who undergo liver transplantation are more likely to die post-transplant because of cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. These people with NASH are often older and are thus more prone to these complications.[14] For these reasons and others, individuals with morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) and NASH with cirrhosis may be considered unfit for liver transplantation until they follow lifestyle modifications to reduce bodyweight.[14] Diabetic people with poor glycemic control are at similar risks, and optimal glycemic control is essential before attempting transplantation.[14]
 The Asia Pacific Working Group guidelines recommend healthcare providers discuss lifestyle modifications before and after transplantation to reduce potential surgery risks and to assist with MASLD management after the transplant.[14]
 Simultaneous bariatric surgery and liver transplantation were performed in exceptional circumstances.[14]
 After transplantation, liver biopsy is the best method to monitor the evolution of post-transplant fibrosis, with significant fibrosis or portal hypertension one year after transplantation predicting rapid progression and graft loss and indicating the need for urgent intervention.[69]
 The average progression rate from one stage of liver fibrosis to the next in humans with NASH is estimated to be seven years. The course of progression varies with different clinical manifestations among individuals.[25][27][120] Fibrosis in humans with MASH progressed more rapidly than in humans with MASLD.[13] Obesity predicts a worse long-term outcome than for lean individuals.[121][122] In the Asia-Pacific region, about 25% of MASLD cases progress to MASH under three years, but only a low proportion (3.7%) develop advanced liver fibrosis.[7] An international study showed that people with MASLD with advanced fibrosis had a 10-year survival rate of 81.5%.[5]
 MASLD is a risk factor for fibrosis, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes based on very-low to low-quality evidence from observational studies.[65][123] Although MASLD can cause cirrhosis and liver failure and liver cancer, most deaths among people with NAFLD are attributable to cardiovascular disease.[52] According to a meta-analysis of 34,000 people with MASLD over seven years, these individuals have a 65% increased risk of developing fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events when compared to those without MASLD.[27]
 MASLD and NASH increase the risk of liver cancer. Cirrhosis and liver cancer induced by NAFLD were the second cause of liver transplantation in the US in 2017. Liver cancer develops in NASH in the absence of cirrhosis in 45% in the cases,[124] and people with NASH cirrhosis have an increased risk of liver cancer. The rate of liver cancer associated with NASH increased fourfold between 2002 and 2012 in the US, which is more than any other cause of liver cancer. MASLD constitutes the third most common risk factor for liver cancer.[125] NAFLD and NASH were found to worsen with cirrhosis in respectively 2–3% and 15–20% of the people over a 10–20 year period.[13] Cirrhosis is found in only about 50% of people with MASLD and with liver cancer, so that liver cancer and cirrhosis are not always linked.[14]
 MASLD is a precursor of metabolic syndrome, although a bidirectional influence is possible.[126][127][128] The presence and stage of fibrosis are the strongest prognostic factors for liver-related events and mortality, in particular for MASLD.[25]
 MASLD incidence is rapidly rising, along with obesity and diabetes, and has become the most common cause of liver disease in developed countries, for adults, teenagers, and children.[24][25] The percentage of people with MASLD ranges from 9 to 36.9% in different parts of the world.[129][130] Approximately 20% of the United States and 25% of the Asia-Pacific populations have non-alcoholic fatty liver.[7][22] Similar prevalence can be found in Europe, although less data is available.[25] MASLD is the most common in the Middle East (32%) and South America (30%), while Africa has the lowest rates (13%).[5][25] Compared to the 2000s, NAFL and NASH respectively increased 2-fold and 2.5-fold in the 2010s in the USA.[131]
 MASLD and NASH are more prevalent in Hispanics - which can be attributed to high rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes in Hispanic populations, intermediate in Whites, and lowest in Blacks.[23][25][132] NAFLD was observed to be twice as prevalent in men as women.[5] For severely obese individuals, the prevalence of MASLD rises over 90%, and for those with diabetes, over 60%, and up to 20% for normal-weight people.[25][26] MASLD is present in 65% to 90% of people who had bariatric surgery, and up to 75% of them have MASH.[14] Ultrasonography and proton NMR spectroscopy studies suggest about 25% of the population seems to be affected by MASLD or MASH.[7][25]
 Although the disease is commonly associated with obesity, a significant proportion of those affected are normal weight or lean. Lean MASLD affects between 10 and 20% of Americans and Europeans, and approximately 25% of Asians, although some countries have a higher incidence (e.g., India has a very high proportion of lean MASLD and almost no obese MASLD). PNPLA3 may be relevant for the progression of MASLD in lean people. Thus, people with MASLD deserve consideration for treatment regardless of the presence or absence of obesity.[7][25][48][121]
 In children ages 1 to 19, the prevalence was found to be approximately 8% in the general population up to 34% in studies with data from child obesity clinics.[133]
 The majority of cryptogenic cirrhosis is believed to be due to MASH.[7] NAFLD prevalence is expected to increase steadily,[134] from 25% in 2018 to a projected 33.5% of people with MASLD globally in 2030, and from 20% to a projected 27% of those with MASLD will progress to MASH.[135]
 The first acknowledged case of obesity-related non-alcoholic fatty liver was observed in 1952 by Samuel Zelman.[136][137] Zelman started investigating after observing a fatty liver in a hospital employee who drank more than twenty bottles of Coca-Cola a day. He then went on to design a trial for a year and a half on 20 obese people who were not alcoholic, finding that about half of them had substantially fatty livers.[136] Fatty liver was, however, linked to diabetes since at least 1784[138] — an observation picked up again in the 1930s.[139] Studies in experimental animals implicated choline inadequacy in the 1920s and excess sugar consumption in 1949.[140]
 The name ""non-alcoholic steatohepatitis"" (NASH) was later defined in 1980 by Jurgen Ludwig and his colleagues from the Mayo Clinic[141] to raise awareness of the existence of this pathology, as similar reports previously were dismissed as ""patients' lies"".[137] This paper was mostly ignored at the time but eventually came to be seen as a landmark paper, and starting in the mid-1990s, the condition began to be intensively studied, with a series of international meetings being held on the topic since 1998.[142] The broader NAFLD term started to be used around 2002.[142][143] Diagnostic criteria began to be worked out, and in 2005 the Pathology Committee of the NIH NASH Clinical Research Network proposed the NAS scoring system.[142]
 EASL recommends Europe's public health authorities to ""restrict advertising and marketing of sugar-sweetened beverages and industrially processed foods high in saturated fat, sugar, and salt"", as well as ""fiscal measures to discourage the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and legislation to ensure that the food industry improves labeling and the composition of processed foods"", as well as ""public awareness campaigns on liver disease, highlighting that it is not only linked to excessive consumption of alcohol"".[134]
 In France, the French syndicate of non-alcoholic beverages ""Boissons Rafraîchissantes de France"" (that included soft drink producers such as Coca-Cola France, Orangina, PepsiCo France) was denounced by the French journal fr:Canard Enchainé for misleading consumers using a communication on their website titled ""Better understanding the NASH pathology"",[144] explaining that ""NASH pathology is sometimes called the soda illness by language abuse or an unfortunate semantic shortcut, as it is not directly linked to the consumption of non-alcoholic beverages"". This page and others on the same website, such as one titled ""Say no to disinformation,"" were since then removed.[145]
 Pediatric MASLD was first reported in 1983.[146][147] It is the most common chronic liver disease among children and adolescents since at least 2007, affecting 10 to 20% of them in the US in 2016.[25][147][148] MASLD is associated with metabolic syndrome, which is a cluster of risk factors that contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies have demonstrated that abdominal obesity and insulin resistance, in particular, are significant contributors to the development of NAFLD.[149][150][151][152][153] Coexisting liver diseases, such as hepatitis C and cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, are also associated with an increased risk of NAFLD.[28][52] Some children were diagnosed as early as two years old, with a mean age of diagnosis between 11 and 13 years old.[147] The mean age is usually above 10 years, as children can also report non-specific symptoms and are thus difficult to diagnose for MASLD.[147]
 Boys are more likely to be diagnosed with MASLD than girls.[28][133] Overweight, or even weight gain, in childhood and adolescence, is associated with an increased risk of MASLD later in life, with adult MASLD predicted in a 31-year follow-up study by risk factors during childhood including BMI, plasma insulin levels, male sex, genetic background (PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 variants) and low birth weight, an emerging risk factor for adulthood MASLD.[25][28] In a study, simple steatosis was present in up to 45% in children with a clinical suspicion of MASLD.[28] Children with simple steatosis have a worse prognosis than adults, with significantly more of them progressing from NAFLD to NASH compared to adults. Indeed, 17-25% of children with MASLD develop MASH in general, and up to 83% for children with severe obesity (versus 29% for adults), further suggesting that hepatic fibrosis seems to follow a more aggressive clinical course in children compared to adults.[147]
 Early diagnosis of MASLD in children may help prevent the development of liver disease during adulthood.[151][154] This is challenging as most children with MASLD are asymptomatic, with only 42-59% showing abdominal pain.[28][154] Other symptoms might be present, such as right upper quadrant pain or acanthosis nigricans, the latter of which is often present in children with NASH. An enlarged liver occurs in 30–40% of children with NAFLD.[28]
 The AASLD recommends a diagnostic liver biopsy in children when the diagnosis is unclear or before starting a potentially hepatotoxic medical therapy.[5] The EASL suggests using fibrosis tests such as elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging, and serum biomarkers to reduce the number of biopsies.[16] In follow up, NICE guidelines recommend that healthcare providers offer children regular MASLD screening for advanced liver fibrosis every two years using the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) blood test.[65] Several studies also suggest magnetic resonance elastography as an alternative to the less reliable ultrasonography.[28]
 Intensive lifestyle modifications, including physical activity and dietary changes, are the first line of treatment according to AASLD and EASL as it improves the liver histology and aminotransferase levels. In terms of pharmacological treatment, the AASLD and EASL do not recommend metformin, but vitamin E may improve liver health for some children.[5][16] The NICE advises the use of vitamin E for children with advanced liver fibrosis, whether they have diabetes or not.[65] The only treatment shown to be effective in childhood MASLD is weight loss.[155]
 Some evidence indicates that maternal undernutrition or overnutrition increases a child's susceptibility to NASH and hastens its progression.[156]
 Since a MASLD diagnosis based on a liver biopsy is invasive and makes it difficult to estimate epidemiology, it is a high research priority to find accurate, inexpensive, and noninvasive methods of diagnosing and monitoring MASLD disease and its progression.[33][157] The search for these biomarkers of MASLD, NAFL, and NASH involves lipidomics, medical imaging, proteomics, blood tests, and scoring systems.[33]
 According to a review, proton density fat fraction estimation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI-PDFF) may be considered the most accurate and even gold standard test to quantify hepatic steatosis. They recommend ultrasound-based transient elastography to accurately diagnose both fibrosis and cirrhosis in a routine clinical setting, with more objectivity than ultrasonography but with lower accuracy than magnetic resonance elastography; and plasma cytokeratin 18 (CK18) fragment levels to be a moderately accurate biomarker of steatohepatitis.[33] However, transient elastography can fail for people with pre-hepatic portal hypertension.[69]
 A variety of medications with different mechanisms of action have been tested in clinical trials.[158] Clinical trials can be separated into four main targets believed to reduce the progression of the disease or reverse it:[159]
 Other treatments such as farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists, and ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) inhibitors may improve NAFLD by multiple mechanisms simultaneously.[160] Drugs in phase III trials as of 2024 are the thyromimetic resmetirom, lanifibranor (a pan-PPAR agonist), and the GLP-1 agonist semaglutide.[161]

"Obesity is commonly defined as having too much body mass. A BMI of 30 or higher is the usual benchmark for obesity in adults. A BMI of 40 or higher is considered severe (formerly “morbid”) obesity. Childhood obesity is measured against growth charts. Obesity is a complex, chronic disease with several causes that lead to excessive body fat and sometimes, poor health. Body fat itself is not a disease, of course. But when your body has too much extra fat, it can change the way it functions. These changes are progressive, can worsen over time, and they can lead to adverse health effects. The good news is that you can improve your health risks by losing some of your excess body fat. Even small changes in weight can have a big impact on your health. Not every weight loss method works for everyone. Most people have tried to lose weight more than once. And keeping the weight off is just as important as losing it in the first place. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Healthcare providers commonly use the Body Mass Index (BMI) to define obesity in the general population. The BMI measures average body weight against average body height. As a generalization, healthcare providers associate a BMI of 30 or higher with obesity. Although BMI has its limitations, it’s an easily measurable indicator and can help alert you to obesity-related health risks. Examples of limitations include bodybuilders and athletes, who have more muscle and may have higher BMI scores even though their fat levels are low. It’s also possible to have obesity at a “normal” weight. If your body weight is average but your body fat percentage is high, you may have the same health risks as somebody with a higher BMI. Healthcare providers have also observed ethnic differences in how much extra weight different people can carry before it affects their health. For example, people of Asian descent are more likely to have health risks at a lower BMI, and Black people are more likely to have health risks at a higher BMI. Another way of assessing obesity is by measuring waist circumference. If you have more body fat around your waist, you are statistically more at risk of obesity-related diseases. The risk becomes significant when your waist size is more than 35 inches for people assigned female at birth or 40 inches for people assigned male at birth. Healthcare providers classify obesity into class types based on how severe it is. They use BMI to do it. If your BMI is between 25.0 and 29.9 kg/m², they put you in the overweight category. There are three general classes of obesity that healthcare providers use to evaluate what treatments may work best for each person. They include: Advertisement ""Morbid obesity"" is an outdated term for class III obesity. In medical language, “morbidity” means associated health risks. Doctors referred to class III obesity as “morbid” because it was most likely to come with related health problems. However, they retired the term because of its negative connotations. Healthcare providers also use BMI to calculate obesity in children, but they calculate it relative to the child’s age and assigned sex. A child older than 2 years may be diagnosed with obesity if their BMI is greater than 95% of their peers in the same category. Different growth charts may present slightly different BMI averages, based on the population they are sampling. Advertisement Obesity in American adults was last surveyed in 2017-2018. The prevalence was 42.5%, up from 30.5% in 1999-2000. In that same period, the prevalence of class III obesity almost doubled from 4.7% to 9.2%. Childhood obesity in America from 2017-2018 was 19.3%. Worldwide, obesity has nearly tripled in the last 50 years. The rise has been especially dramatic in lower-income countries where malnutrition is common. These communities now have greater access to higher-calorie foods with low nutritional value. Obesity now commonly coexists with undernutrition in these countries. Obesity affects your body in many ways. Some are simply the mechanical effects of having more body fat. For example, you can draw a clear line between extra weight on your body and extra pressure on your skeleton and joints. Other effects are more subtle, such as chemical changes in your blood that increase your risk for diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Some effects are still not well understood. For example, there is an increased risk of certain cancers with obesity. We don’t know why, but it exists. Statistically, obesity increases your risk of premature death from all causes. By the same token, studies show that you can significantly improve these risks by losing even a small amount of weight (5% to 10%). Your metabolism is the process of converting calories into energy to fuel your body’s functions. When your body has more calories than it can use, it converts the extra calories into lipids and stores them in your adipose tissue (body fat). When you run out of tissue to store lipids in, the fat cells themselves become enlarged. Enlarged fat cells secrete hormones and other chemicals that produce an inflammatory response. Chronic inflammation has many adverse health effects. One way that it affects your metabolism is by contributing to insulin resistance. This means your body can no longer use insulin to efficiently lower blood glucose and blood lipid levels (sugars and fats in your blood). High blood sugar and blood lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) also contribute to high blood pressure. Together, these combined risk factors are known as metabolic syndrome. They are grouped together because they all tend to reinforce each other. They also reinforce further weight gain and make it harder to lose weight and sustain weight loss. Metabolic syndrome is a common factor in obesity and contributes to many related diseases, including: Excess body fat can crowd the organs of your respiratory system and put stress and strain on your musculoskeletal system. This contributes to: According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 3 adults with obesity also has arthritis. Studies have shown that for every 5 kg in weight gain, your risk of knee arthritis increases by 36%. The good news is that, together with exercise, weight loss of 10% can significantly reduce arthritis-related pain and improve your quality of life. Obesity is also associated indirectly with: On the most basic level, obesity is caused by consuming more calories than your body can use. Many factors contribute to this. Some factors are individual to you. Others are built into the structure of our society, either on a national, local or family level. In some ways, preventing obesity requires consciously working against these multiple factors. Factors that may increase calorie consumption include: Factors that may decrease how many calories we spend include: Your healthcare provider will measure your weight, height and waist circumference at your appointment. More importantly, when you come to your healthcare provider for care, they will want to know your whole health story. They will ask you about your history of medical conditions, medications and weight changes. They’ll also want to know about your current eating, sleeping and exercise patterns and stress factors and whether you have tried any weight loss programs in the past. They may ask about your biological family’s health history. They will also examine your vital functions by taking your heart rate and blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. They may give you a blood test to check your blood glucose and cholesterol levels and screen for hormone problems. They'll use this complete profile to diagnose your obesity and any related conditions you might have. Your complete health profile will determine your individual treatment plan. Your healthcare provider will target your most urgent health concerns first, then follow up with a longer-term weight loss plan. Sometimes there may be quick changes they can recommend for an immediate impact, like switching your medications. The overall treatment plan will be more gradual and probably involve many factors. Since everyone is different, it may take some trial and error to figure out which therapies work best for you. Studies have repeatedly shown that intense, team-based programs with frequent, personal communication between your provider and you are the most successful in helping people lose weight and keep it off. Your treatment plan may include: The dietary changes you personally need to make to lose weight will be individual to you. Some people may benefit from cutting portion sizes or snacks between meals. For others, it may be more about changing what they eat than how much. Almost everyone can benefit from eating more plants. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes tend to be lower in fat and higher in fiber and micronutrients. They are more nutritious and can make you feel fuller and more satisfied after eating fewer calories. Everyone has heard that diet and exercise are both important to weight loss and weight maintenance. But exercise doesn’t have to mean a gym membership. Just walking at a moderate pace is one of the most efficient types of exercise for weight loss. Just 30 minutes, five days a week is what healthcare providers suggest. A daily walk at lunchtime or before or after work can make a real difference. Counseling, support groups and methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy may have a role to play in supporting your weight loss journey. These methods can help rewire your brain to support positive changes. They can also help you manage stress and address emotional and psychological factors that may be working against you. Weight and weight loss efforts affect us on many levels, so it can be helpful to have support on the human side as well as on the practical side. Your healthcare provider may recommend medications to use in conjunction with other treatments. Medications aren’t the whole answer to weight loss, but they can help tackle it from another angle. For example, appetite suppressants can intercept some of the pathways to your brain that affect your hunger. For some people, this might be a small piece of the puzzle, but for others, it might be a bigger one. Common FDA-approved drugs for treating obesity include: If you have been diagnosed with class III obesity, bariatric surgery may be an option for you. Surgery is a severe but highly effective solution to long-term, significant weight loss. It works by changing your biology instead of just your mind or your habits. All bariatric surgery procedures alter your digestive system in some way. They restrict the number of calories you can consume and absorb. They also change hormonal factors in your digestive system that affect your metabolism and hunger. Bariatric surgery procedures include: Preventing obesity is easier than treating it once it has taken hold. Once your body has established a new high “set point,"" it will consider that to be your new baseline weight. Your body works to modulate your hunger signals and energy expenditure to maintain the same body mass, in spite of your weight-loss intentions. If you’ve noticed a pattern of recent weight gain in yourself or your child, or if you have a family history of obesity, you might want to take steps to intervene sooner rather than later. Examining your habits and making reasonable changes now can help you prevent future obesity and weight loss struggles. For example: Obesity puts you at risk of certain adverse health conditions. That doesn’t mean you have those conditions right now. And it doesn't mean that you can’t do anything about them. The risks are worth your concern, but they’re also reversible or manageable. Your healthcare provider will encourage you to reduce them by losing weight. While it will be challenging, it can be done. Remember, weight loss of just 5% to 10% can significantly improve your health risks. It can slow or stop the progression of fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. With medical guidance, weight loss of at least this much is achievable, and possibly much more. Sticking with a long-term treatment plan can help you maintain weight loss. A note from Cleveland Clinic You may have experienced a bias that obesity is a personal choice or a moral failure. If you’re seeking medical advice for obesity, chances are you’ve already tried to manage it several times on your own. The good news is that as research continues, breakthroughs in medicine continue to offer new hope for treating obesity. It might take some exploring to land on the right formula for you, but together with your healthcare provider, you can take your health back into your own hands. Even a little weight loss can improve your health on almost every level, and you can reap lifelong benefits from healthy diet and lifestyle changes. Last reviewed on 06/13/2022.

"Obesity is a long-term (chronic) health condition that progresses over time. Obesity is defined by excess body fat (adipose tissue) that may impair health. Body mass index (BMI) is a calculation that takes a person’s weight and height into account to measure body size. Doctors typically use it as a screening tool for obesity. In adults, obesity is often defined as having a BMI of 30 or more, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing serious diseases, including: While BMI tends to relate to the level of body fat, it has some limitations as a measurement. According to the CDC, “Factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, and muscle mass can influence the relationship between BMI and body fat. Also, BMI doesn’t distinguish between excess fat, muscle, or bone mass, nor does it provide any indication of the distribution of fat among individuals.” Despite these limitations, BMI continues to be widely used as a way to measure body size. This is because it’s less expensive than other methods. It’s worth noting that the effects of weight discrimination can also contribute to negative health effects. Obesity is common. The CDC estimates that 41.9% of people in the United States had obesity from 2017 to March 2020. Keep reading to learn more about obesity causes, risk factors, and treatment. You’ll notice that the language used to share stats and other data points is pretty binary, fluctuating between the use of “men” and “women.” Although we typically avoid language like this, specificity is key when reporting on research participants and clinical findings. Unfortunately, the studies and surveys referenced in this article didn’t report data on, or include, participants who were transgender, nonbinary, gender nonconforming, genderqueer, agender, or genderless. There are no specific symptoms associated with obesity. A doctor may diagnose obesity based on the following factors: The following classes are used for adults who are at least 20 years old: For a doctor to diagnose obesity in a child over 2 years old or a teen, their BMI has to be at or above the 95th percentile. A BMI at or above the 95th percentile is higher than the BMI of 95% of people with the same age and sex assigned at birth. From 2015 to 2016, 18.5% (or about 13.7 million) of U.S. youth between 2 and 19 years old were considered to have clinical obesity. Taking in more calories than you burn in daily activity and exercise — on a long-term basis — can lead to obesity. Over time, these extra calories add up and cause weight gain. But it’s not always just about calories in and calories out or having a sedentary lifestyle. While those are indeed causes of obesity, some causes you can’t control. Common specific causes of obesity include: Certain health conditions can also lead to weight gain, which may lead to obesity. These include: A complex mix of factors can increase a person’s risk of obesity.  Some people have genes that make it more likely for them to gain weight and body fat. Your environment at home, at school, and in your community can all influence how and what you eat, as well as how active you are.  You may be at a higher risk of developing obesity if you:  Depression can sometimes lead to weight gain, as some people may turn to food for emotional comfort.  Having disturbed sleeping patterns can make you eat more during the day, especially foods high in fat and carbohydrates. If you smoke, quitting smoking is beneficial to your health, but quitting may lead to weight gain too. In some people, it may lead to excessive weight gain. For that reason, it’s important to focus on diet and exercise while you’re quitting, at least after the initial withdrawal period. Certain medications can also raise your risk of weight gain. These medications can include: BMI provides a rough calculation of a person’s weight in relation to their height. Other more accurate measures of body fat and where body fat is located include: A doctor may also order certain tests to help diagnose obesity-related health risks. These may include:  A measurement of the fat around your waist is also a good predictor of your risk of developing obesity-related diseases. Obesity can lead to more than weight gain.  Having a high ratio of body fat to muscle puts strain on your bones as well as your internal organs. It also increases inflammation in the body, which may be a risk factor for cancer. Obesity is also a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Researchers have linked obesity to many health complications, some of which can be life threatening if not treated: If you have obesity and would like to lose weight but have been unable to do so on your own, medical help is available. Start with a primary care physician, who may be able to refer you to a weight specialist in your area. A doctor may also want to work with you as part of a team helping you lose weight. That team might include a dietitian, therapist, or other healthcare staff. The doctor will work with you on making needed lifestyle changes. Sometimes, they may recommend medications or weight loss surgery as well. Learn more about treatment for obesity. Doctors typically recommend lifestyle and behavioral changes to help children with obesity lose weight. In some cases, doctors may prescribe medication. A healthcare team can recommend food choices and help develop a nutritious eating plan that works for you. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases suggests that an eating plan that you can stick to long-term may help you lose weight and maintain a moderate weight. A structured exercise program and increased daily activity — between 150 and 300 minutes a week — will help build up your strength, endurance, and metabolism. Counseling or support groups may also identify triggers and help you cope with issues relating to: A doctor may also prescribe certain prescription weight loss medications in addition to eating and exercise plans.  Doctors may prescribe medications if other methods of weight loss haven’t worked and if you have a BMI of 27 or more in addition to obesity-related health issues. Prescription weight loss medications either prevent the absorption of fat or suppress appetite. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following medications for short-term use (up to 12 weeks): These drugs may have unpleasant side effects for some people but may have more serious side effects for others. For example, orlistat can lead to the unpleasant side effects of oily and frequent bowel movements, bowel urgency, and gas. But liraglutide and semaglutide may increase the risk of thyroid cancer for people with a personal or family history.  It’s important to inform the prescribing doctor about your medical history before beginning any of these medications. The doctor will typically monitor you closely to manage side effects and reduce your risks. Weight loss surgery is commonly called bariatric surgery. This type of surgery limits how much food you can comfortably eat or prevents your body from absorbing food and calories. Sometimes it can do both. Weight loss surgery isn’t a quick fix. It’s a major surgery and can have serious risks. Afterward, people who undergo surgery will need to change how they eat and how much they eat, or they risk getting sick.  However, nonsurgical options aren’t always effective at helping people with obesity lose weight and reduce their risk of comorbidities. Types of weight loss surgery include: For decades, experts recommended that adult candidates for weight loss surgery have a BMI of at least 35 (classes 2 and 3).  However, in 2018 guidelines, the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) endorsed weight loss surgery for adults with BMIs of 30 up to 35 (class 1) who:  For individuals with class 1 obesity, surgery is most effective for those between the ages of 18 and 65 years. Some people may have to lose weight before surgery can be approved. Additionally, they’ll normally undergo counseling to ensure that they’re both emotionally prepared for the surgery and the lifestyle changes that it’ll require. Only a few surgical centers in the United States perform these types of procedures on children under 18 years old.  Due to a dramatic increase in obesity and obesity-related diseases, communities, states, and the federal government are putting an emphasis on healthier food choices and activities to help prevent obesity and treat people with overweight and obesity. On a personal level, you can help prevent weight gain and obesity by: Obesity is a chronic medical condition caused by excess visceral fat.

 The term obese describes a person who has excess body fat. In the UK it's estimated that around 1 in every 4 adults and around 1 in every 5 children aged 10 to 11 are living with obesity. The most widely used method to check if you're a healthy weight is body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure of whether you're a healthy weight for your height. You can use the NHS BMI healthy weight calculator to find out your BMI. For most adults, if your BMI is: If you have an Asian, Chinese, Middle Eastern, Black African or African-Caribbean family background you'll need to use a lower BMI score to measure overweight and obesity: BMI score has some limitations because it measures whether a person is carrying too much weight but not too much fat. For example, people who are very muscular, like professional sportspeople, can have a high BMI without much fat. But for most people, BMI is a useful indication of whether they're a healthy weight. Another measure of excess fat is waist to height ratio, which can be used as an additional measure in adults who have a BMI under 35. To calculate your waist to height ratio: For example, if your waist is 80cm and you are 160cm tall, you would calculate your result like this: 80 divided by 160, which equals 0.5. A waist to height ratio of 0.5 or higher means you may have increased health risks. This video explains how to measure your waist so you can calculate your waist to height ratio. Obesity is a serious health concern that increases the risk of many other health conditions. These include: Living with overweight and obesity can also affect your quality of life and contribute to mental health problems, such as depression, and can also affect self-esteem. Obesity is a complex issue with many causes. Obesity and overweight is caused when extra calories, particularly those from foods high in fat and sugar, are stored in the body as fat. Obesity is an increasingly common problem because the environment we live in makes it difficult for many people to eat healthily and do enough physical activity. Genetics can also be a cause of obesity for some people. Your genes can affect how your body uses food and stores fat. There are also some underlying health conditions that can occasionally contribute to weight gain, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), although these types of conditions do not usually cause weight problems if they're effectively controlled with medicines. Some medicines can also make people more likely to put on weight, including steroids and some medicines for high blood pressure, diabetes or mental health conditions. The best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy reduced-calorie diet and exercise regularly. To do this, you can: You may benefit from joining a local weight management programme with group meetings or online support. Your GP can tell you about these. You may also benefit from receiving support and counselling from a trained healthcare professional to help you better understand your relationship with food and develop different eating habits. If you're living with obesity and lifestyle and behavioural changes alone do not help you lose weight, a medicine called orlistat may be recommended. If taken correctly, this medicine works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb during digestion. Your GP will know whether orlistat is suitable for you. A specialist may prescribe other medicines called liraglutide or semaglutide. They work by making you feel fuller and less hungry. For some people living with obesity, a specialist may recommend weight loss surgery. Living with obesity can cause a number of further problems, including difficulties with daily activities and serious health conditions. Day-to-day problems related to obesity include: The psychological problems associated with living with obesity can also affect your relationships with family and friends, and may lead to depression. Living with obesity can also increase your risk of developing many potentially serious health conditions, including: Obesity reduces life expectancy by an average of 3 to 10 years, depending on how severe it is. Managing a complex issue like obesity can be hard. Losing weight takes time and commitment. The healthcare professionals involved with your care can provide encouragement and advice about how to mange your weight, build healthy lifestyle habits and maintain weight loss achieved. Completing a weight management programme, regularly monitoring your weight, setting realistic goals, and involving your friends and family with ways to lose weight can also help. It's important to remember that losing what seems like a small amount of weight, such as 3% or more of your original body weight, and maintaining this for life, can significantly reduce your risk of developing obesity-related complications like diabetes and heart disease. If you: Our guide to care and support explains your options and where you can get support. If it's been a long time since you did any exercise, you should check out the Couch to 5K running plan. It consists of podcasts delivered over the course of 9 weeks and has been specifically designed for absolute beginners. To begin with, you start running for short periods of time, and as the plan progresses, gradually increase the amount. At the end of the 9 weeks, you should be able to run for 30 minutes non-stop, which for most people is around 5 kilometres (3.1 miles).

"Central hypoventilation syndrome (CHS) is a sleep-related breathing disorder that causes ineffective breathing, apnea, or respiratory arrest during sleep (and during wakefulness in severe cases). CHS can either be congenital (CCHS) or acquired (ACHS) later in life. The condition can be fatal if untreated. CCHS was once known as Ondine's curse.
 ACHS can develop as a result of severe injury or trauma to the brain or brainstem.[1] Congenital cases are very rare and involve a failure of autonomic control of breathing. In 2006, there were only about 200 known cases worldwide. As of 2008, only 1000 total cases were known.[2] The diagnosis may be delayed because of variations in the severity of the manifestations or lack of awareness in the medical community, particularly in milder cases.[3]  However, as there have been cases where asymptomatic family members also were found to have CCHS, it may be that these figures only reflect those found to require mechanical ventilation. In all cases, episodes of apnea occur in sleep, but in a few patients, at the most severe end of the spectrum, apnea also occurs while awake.
 Although rare, cases of long-term untreated CCHS have been reported and are termed late onset CCHS (LO-CCHS).[4]  There have, however, even been cases of LO-CCHS where family members found to have it have been asymptomatic.[5] Again, lack of awareness in the medical community may cause such a delay.[6] CCHS susceptibility is not known to be affected by sex or race.[3]
 CHS is associated with respiratory arrests during sleep and, in some cases, to neuroblastoma (tumors of the sympathetic ganglia), Hirschsprung disease (partial agenesis of the enteric nervous system),[7] dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and anomalies of the pupilla.  Other symptoms include darkening of skin color from inadequate amounts of oxygen, drowsiness, fatigue, headaches, and an inability to sleep at night.  Patients with CHS also have a sensitivity to sedatives and narcotics, which makes respiration even more difficult. A low concentration of oxygen in the red blood cells also may cause hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension, culminating in cor pulmonale or a failure of the right side of the heart.[8]  Associated complications may also include gastro-esophageal reflux, ophthalmologic issues, seizures, recurrent pneumonia, developmental delays, learning disabilities, episodes of fainting, and temperature disregulation.[9]
 CHS is exhibited typically as a congenital disorder, but in rare circumstances, can also result from severe brain or spinal trauma or injury (such as after an automobile accident, stroke, asphyxiation, brain tumor, encephalitis, poisoning, as a complication of neurosurgery) or due to particular neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or multiple sclerosis.  Long and Allen (1984) were the first to report the abnormal brainstem auditory-evoked responses in an alcoholic woman who recovered from Ondine's curse. These investigators hypothesized that their patient's brainstem was poisoned—not destroyed—by her chronic alcoholism.[10]
 Medical investigation of patients with this syndrome has led to a deeper understanding of how the body and brain regulate breathing on a molecular level. PHOX2B, a transcription factor involved in the development of neurons,[11] can be associated with this condition.[12][13][14][15] This homeobox gene is important for the normal development of the autonomic nervous system.[16]
 The disease used to be classified as a ""neurocristopathy"",[17][18] or disease of the neural crest because part of the autonomic nervous system (such as sympathetic ganglia) derives from the neural crest. However, this denomination is no longer favored because essential neurons of the autonomic nervous system, including those that underlie the defining symptom of the disease (respiratory arrests), are derived from the neural tube (the medulla), not from the neural crest, which may be the case in other mixed embryological origins and neurocristopathies.[19]
 Children with CCHS develop life-threatening episodes of apnea with cyanosis, usually in the first months of life. Medical evaluation excludes lesions of the brain, heart, and lungs but demonstrates impaired responses to build-up of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) and decreases of oxygen in the circulation (hypoxia), the two strongest stimuli to increase breathing rate.[citation needed]
 Polysomnography shows that hypoventilation is most marked during slow-wave sleep. In the most severe cases, hypoventilation is present during other nonrapid eye movement sleep stages and even wakefulness. A subset of CCHS patients are at very high risk for developing malignant neural crest-derived tumors, such as neuroblastoma.
 Sequencing of the gene PHOX2B revealed mutations in 91% of the cases within a French cohort.[7]
 Physicians unable to recognize the disorder should seek help from a neurologist and a pulmonologist. In some locations, such as France, optimal management of patients, once identified, has been aided by the creation of a national registry and the formation of a network of centers.[citation needed]
 People generally require tracheostomy and lifetime mechanical ventilation on a ventilator in order to survive. However, it has now been shown that biphasic cuirass ventilation can effectively be used without the need for a tracheotomy. Other potential treatments for CHS include oxygen therapy and medicine for stimulating the respiratory system.  Currently, problems arise with the extended use of ventilators, including fatal infections and pneumonia.[20]
 Most people with CCHS (unless they have the Late Onset form) do not survive infancy, unless they receive ventilatory assistance during sleep. An alternative to a mechanical ventilator is diaphragm pacing.[21]
 CCHS was first described in 1962 by Severinghaus and Mitchell in three patients following surgery to the upper cervical spinal cord and brainstem.[22]
 Its name is a reference to the story of Ondine and Hans, characters in Ondine, a 1938 play by Jean Giraudoux based on traditions tracing back through Undine (a novella of 1811) to earlier European folk tales. The water-spirit Ondine tells her future husband Hans, whom she had just met, that ""I shall be the shoes of your feet ... I shall be the breath of your lungs"". Ondine reluctantly makes a pact with her uncle the King of the Ondines that if Hans ever deceives her he will die. After their honeymoon, Hans is reunited with his first love Princess Bertha. Ondine leaves Hans in an attempt to protect him, but she is recaptured by a fisherman and Hans is stricken by the King's curse. On meeting Ondine again, Hans tells her that ""all the things my body once did by itself, it does now only by special order ... A single moment of inattention and I forget to breathe"". Hans and Ondine kiss, after which he dies.
 Since being coined in 1962 the name has become controversial in medical literature, as later summaries frequently misunderstood the plot of Ondine and its connection to the diagnosis. Most frequently, Ondine was inaccurately blamed for cursing Hans, but other mistakes sometimes changed the nature of the curse itself. Such errors led to confusion in defining the medical condition.[23]

"Ovarian cancer starts in your ovaries — small organs in the female reproductive system where eggs form. Ovarian cancer is sometimes difficult to detect because symptoms often don’t develop until later stages. Healthcare providers treat ovarian cancer with surgery, chemotherapy and other cancer treatments. Ovarian cancer occurs when abnormal cells in your ovaries or fallopian tubes grow and multiply out of control. Ovaries are part of the female reproductive system. These two round, walnut-sized organs make eggs during your reproductive years. Ovarian cancer affects women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB). It’s slightly more common in Native American and white populations than in people who are Black, Hispanic or Asian. In addition, people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are much more likely to have a BRCA gene mutation, placing them at a higher risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer accounts for 1% of all new cancer cases in the U.S. The lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer is approximately 1 in 78. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Ovarian cancer can develop and spread throughout your abdomen before it causes any symptoms. This can make early detection difficult. Ovarian cancer symptoms may include: If you develop any of the symptoms listed above, schedule a visit with a healthcare provider. The exact cause of ovarian cancer isn’t yet known. But some people have a slightly higher risk of developing the condition. Ovarian cancer risk factors include: There’s also an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer as you grow older. If ovarian cancer spreads, it usually does so from your pelvis to your lymph nodes, abdomen, intestines, stomach, chest or liver. Advertisement Despite years of research, experts haven’t yet developed a successful ovarian cancer screening test. For this reason, the condition is often difficult to diagnose in the early stages. If your healthcare provider suspects ovarian cancer, they’ll ask about your symptoms and perform a pelvic exam. During the exam, they’ll check for any abnormal growths or enlarged organs. They may recommend additional tests, including: Providers may use several imaging tests, including: Blood tests look for a substance called CA-125. High levels of CA-125 in your blood can be a sign of cancer. However, CA-125 levels can be normal, even when cancer is present, and higher in many conditions that aren’t cancer. Because of this, providers use blood tests in combination with other tests to diagnose ovarian cancer. Providers can diagnose ovarian cancer during surgery. Typically, if they find abnormal growths, they’ll remove them during the same procedure. During laparoscopic surgery, a surgeon places a thin camera (laparoscope) through a small cut (incision) made in your abdomen. Using the scope as a guide, along with additional ports to hold instruments, the surgeon can assess the cancer, perform staging biopsies and, in some circumstances, remove ovarian tumors. There are four stages of ovarian cancer. In this cancer staging system, the least severe is the lowest number. The more serious the condition, the higher the number. Staging is important because it helps your healthcare provider design a tailored treatment plan for you. Your healthcare provider will talk with you about your treatment options. Advertisement The goal in treating cancer is to remove as much, if not all, cancer from your body as possible. Common ovarian cancer treatments include: After you’ve completed ovarian cancer treatment, your healthcare provider will want to see you regularly for observation. You may have routine appointments to check and make sure the cancer hasn’t returned over time. During these appointments, your provider may go through any possible symptoms and do an exam. Be mindful of any symptoms you may be having and tell your provider about them. Sometimes, your provider may order imaging tests, typically a CT scan. There’s no way to prevent ovarian cancer completely. But knowing your biological family history can help you prepare for any heightened risk of developing ovarian cancer. If you have a genetic mutation such as BRCA mutation, your healthcare provider may recommend risk-reducing surgery to remove your ovaries and tubes before they become cancerous. If you’re not sure if you have a BRCA or another mutation, ask your healthcare provider about genetic testing. After you’ve received ovarian cancer treatment, your healthcare provider will still see you for regular appointments. During these visits, they’ll check on any symptoms you may have and discuss any concerns. It’s important to pay close attention to your body and let your provider know if anything unusual is happening. Observation is key after ovarian cancer treatment. The overall five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer is 49%. That means that approximately 49% of people diagnosed with ovarian cancer are alive five years from diagnosis. It’s important to understand that survival rates are just estimates. They can’t tell you how long you’ll survive or predict the success of your treatment. If you have specific questions about ovarian cancer survival rates, talk with your healthcare provider. If you develop signs of ovarian cancer, such as unusual lumps, pain or bloating in your abdomen, schedule a visit with a healthcare provider. If you’ve received an ovarian cancer diagnosis, you may want to ask your healthcare provider questions such as: A note from Cleveland Clinic A cancer diagnosis is scary, no matter the type. If you or a loved one has ovarian cancer, you may also feel sad, frustrated or hopeless. Your healthcare provider can help you during this trying time. Ask about resources or support groups (local or online).

 Ovarian cancer is a cancerous tumor of an ovary.[10] It may originate from the ovary itself or more commonly from communicating nearby structures such as fallopian tubes or the inner lining of the abdomen.[3][11] The ovary is made up of three different cell types including epithelial cells, germ cells, and stromal cells.[12] When these cells become abnormal, they have the ability to divide and form tumors. These cells can also invade or spread to other parts of the body.[13] When this process begins, there may be no or only vague symptoms.[1] Symptoms become more noticeable as the cancer progresses.[1][14] These symptoms may include bloating, vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, abdominal swelling, constipation, and loss of appetite, among others.[1] Common areas to which the cancer may spread include the lining of the abdomen, lymph nodes, lungs, and liver.[15]
 The risk of ovarian cancer increases with age. Most cases of ovarian cancer develop after menopause.[16] It is also more common in women who have ovulated more over their lifetime.[17] This includes those who have never had children, those who began ovulation at a younger age and those who reach menopause at an older age.[5] Other risk factors include hormone therapy after menopause, fertility medication, and obesity.[4][6] Factors that decrease risk include hormonal birth control, tubal ligation, pregnancy, and breast feeding.[6] About 10% of cases are related to inherited genetic risk; women with mutations in the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 have about a 50% chance of developing the disease.[5] Some family cancer syndromes such as hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome also increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[16] Epithelial ovarian carcinoma is the most common type of ovarian cancer, comprising more than 95% of cases.[5] There are five main subtypes of ovarian carcinoma, of which high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common.[5] Less common types of ovarian cancer include germ cell tumors[18] and sex cord stromal tumors.[5] A diagnosis of ovarian cancer is confirmed through a biopsy of tissue, usually removed during surgery.[1]
 Screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks.[19] Those at very high risk may have their ovaries removed as a preventive measure.[4] If caught and treated in an early stage, ovarian cancer is often curable.[1] Treatment usually includes some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.[1] Outcomes depend on the extent of the disease, the subtype of cancer present, and other medical conditions.[5][20] The overall five-year survival rate in the United States is 49%.[7] Outcomes are worse in the developing world.[5]
 In 2020, new cases occurred in approximately 313,000 women.[21] In 2019 it resulted in 13,445 deaths in the United States.[22] Death from ovarian cancer increased globally between 1990 and 2017 by 84.2%.[23] Ovarian cancer is the second-most common gynecologic cancer in the United States. It causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.[24] Among women it ranks fifth in cancer-related deaths.[25] The typical age of diagnosis is 63.[2] Death from ovarian cancer is more common in North America and Europe than in Africa and Asia.[5] In the United States, it is more common in White and Hispanic women than Black or American Indian women.[22]
 Early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may be absent or subtle. In most cases, symptoms exist for several months before being recognized and diagnosed.[26][27] Symptoms can often be misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.[28] The early stages of ovarian cancer tend to be painless which makes it difficult to detect it early on. Symptoms can vary based on the subtype.[26] Ovarian borderline tumors, also known as low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, do not cause an increase in CA125 levels and are not identifiable with an ultrasound. The typical symptoms of an LMP tumor can include abdominal distension or pelvic pain. Particularly large masses tend to be benign or borderline.[29][26]
 The most typical symptoms of ovarian cancer include bloating, abdominal or pelvic pain or discomfort, back pain, irregular menstruation or postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, pain or bleeding after or during sexual intercourse, loss of appetite, fatigue, diarrhea, indigestion, heartburn, constipation, nausea, feeling full, and possibly urinary symptoms (including frequent urination and urgent urination).[27]
 Later symptoms of ovarian cancer are due to the growing mass causing pain by pressing on other abdominopelvic organs or from metastases.[26][30][31] Because of the anatomic location of the ovaries deep in the pelvis, most masses are large and advanced at the time of diagnosis.[14] The growing mass may cause pain if ovarian torsion develops. If these symptoms start to occur more often or more severely than usual, especially after no significant history of such symptoms, ovarian cancer is considered.[26][29] Metastases may cause a Sister Mary Joseph nodule.[31] Rarely, teratomas can cause growing teratoma syndrome or peritoneal gliomatosis.[31]  Some experience menometrorrhagia and abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause in most cases. Other common symptoms include hirsutism, abdominal pain, virilization, and an adnexal mass.[32]
 In adolescents or children with ovarian tumors, symptoms can include severe abdominal pain, irritation of the peritoneum, or bleeding.[33] Sex cord stromal tumors produce hormones which can lead to the premature development of secondary sex characteristics. Sex cord-stromal tumors in prepubertal children may be manifested by signs of early puberty; abdominal pain and distension are also common. Adolescents with sex cord-stromal tumors may experience amenorrhea. As the cancer becomes more advanced, it can cause an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen and lead to distension. If the malignancy has not been diagnosed by the time it causes ascites, it is typically diagnosed shortly thereafter.[26] Advanced cancers can also cause abdominal masses, lymph node masses, or pleural effusion.[31]
 There are many known risk factors that may increase a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. The risk of developing ovarian cancer is related to the amount of time a woman spends ovulating.[34] Factors that increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[34] During ovulation, cells are stimulated to divide. If this division is abnormally regulated, tumors may form which can be malignant. Early menarche and late menopause increase the number of ovulatory cycles a woman undergoes in her lifetime and so increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer.[29][34][35] Since ovulation is suppressed during pregnancy, not having children also increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[35] Therefore, women who have not borne children are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have.[26] Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.[26]
 The risk of developing ovarian cancer is less for women who have fewer menstrual cycles, no menstrual cycles, breast feeding, take oral contraceptives, have multiple pregnancies, and have a pregnancy at an early age.  The risk of developing ovarian cancer is reduced in women who have had tubal ligation (colloquially known as having one's ""tubes tied""), both ovaries removed, or hysterectomy (an operation in which the uterus is removed).[27] Age is also a risk factor.[26][20] Non-genetic factors such as diabetes mellitus, high body mass index, tobacco, and alcohol use are also risk factors for ovarian cancer.[23]
 The use of fertility medication may contribute to ovarian borderline tumor formation, but the link between the two is disputed and difficult to study.[28] Fertility drugs may be associated with a higher risk of borderline tumors.[31] Those who have been treated for infertility but remain nulliparous are at higher risk for epithelial ovarian cancer due to hormonal exposure that may lead to proliferation of cells. However, those who are successfully treated for infertility and subsequently give birth are at no higher risk. This may be due to shedding of precancerous cells during pregnancy, but the cause remains unclear.[29] The risk factor may instead be infertility itself, not the treatment.[34]
 Hormonal conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis are associated with ovarian cancer, but the link is not completely confirmed.[28] Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen likely increases the risk of ovarian cancer. The association has not been confirmed in a large-scale study,[29][36] but notable studies including the Million Women Study have supported this link. Postmenopausal HRT with combined estrogen and progesterone may increase contemporaneous risk if used for over 5 years, but this risk returns to normal after cessation of therapy.[34] Estrogen HRT with or without progestins increases the risk of endometrioid and serous tumors but lowers the risk of mucinous tumors. Higher doses of estrogen increase this risk.[31] Endometriosis is another risk factor for ovarian cancer,[34] as is pain with menstruation. Endometriosis is associated with clear-cell and endometrioid subtypes, low-grade serous tumors, stage I and II tumors, grade 1 tumors, and lower mortality.[31]
 Before menopause, obesity can increase a person's risk of ovarian cancer, but this risk is not present after menopause. This risk is also relevant in those who are both obese and have never used HRT. A similar association with ovarian cancer appears in taller women.[34]
 A family history of ovarian cancer is a risk factor for ovarian cancer. Women with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (Lynch syndrome), and those with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genetic abnormalities are at increased risk.
 The major genetic risk factor for ovarian cancer is a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, or in DNA mismatch repair genes, which is present in 10% of ovarian cancer cases. Only one allele needs to be mutated to place a person at high risk. The gene can be inherited through either the maternal or paternal line, but has variable penetrance.[26][29] Though mutations in these genes are usually associated with increased risk of breast cancer, they also carry a substantial lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, a risk that peaks in a person's 40s and 50s. The lowest risk cited is 30% and the highest 60%.[28][26][29] Mutations in BRCA1 have a lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer of 15–45%.[31] Mutations in BRCA2 are less risky than those with BRCA1, with a lifetime risk of 10% (lowest risk cited) to 40% (highest risk cited).[26][31] On average, BRCA-associated cancers develop 15 years before their sporadic counterparts because people who inherit the mutations on one copy of their gene only need one mutation to start the process of carcinogenesis, whereas people with two normal genes would need to acquire two mutations.[29]
 In the United States, five of 100 women with a first-degree relative with ovarian cancer will eventually get ovarian cancer themselves, placing those with affected family members at triple the risk of women with unaffected family members. Seven of 100 women with two or more relatives with ovarian cancer will eventually get ovarian cancer.[29][37] In general, 5–10% of ovarian cancer cases have a genetic cause.[29] BRCA mutations are associated with high-grade serous nonmucinous epithelial ovarian cancer.[31]
 A strong family history of endometrial cancer, colon cancer, or other gastrointestinal cancers may indicate the presence of a syndrome known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (also known as Lynch syndrome), which confers a higher risk for developing a number of cancers, including ovarian cancer. Lynch syndrome is caused by mutations in mismatch repair genes, including MSH2, MLH1, MLH6, PMS1, and PMS2.[26] The risk of ovarian cancer for an individual with Lynch syndrome is between 10 and 12 percent.[26][29] Women of Icelandic descent, European Jewish descent/Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and Hungarian descent are at higher risk for epithelial ovarian cancer.[29] Estrogen receptor beta gene (ESR2) seems to be a key to pathogenesis and response to therapy.[38] Other genes that have been associated with ovarian cancer are BRIP1, MSH6, RAD51C and RAD51D.[39] CDH1, CHEK2, PALB2 and RAD50 have also been associated with ovarian cancer.[40]
 Several rare genetic disorders are associated with specific subtypes of ovarian cancer. Peutz–Jeghers syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, also predisposes women to sex cord tumour with annular tubules.[28][26] Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome are associated with granulosa cell tumors in children and may also be associated with Sertoli-Leydig tumors. Benign fibromas are associated with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.[26]
 Alcohol consumption does not appear to be related to ovarian cancer.[31][41]
 The American Cancer Society recommends a healthy eating pattern that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and a diet that avoids or limits red and processed meats and processed sugar.[42] High consumption of total, saturated and trans-fats increases ovarian cancer risk.[43] A 2021 umbrella review found that coffee, egg, and fat intake significantly increases the risk of ovarian cancer.[44] There is mixed evidence from studies on ovarian cancer risk and consumption of dairy products.[45][46]
 Industrialized nations, with the exception of Japan, have high rates of epithelial ovarian cancer, which may be due to diet in those countries. White women are at a 30–40% higher risk for ovarian cancer when compared to Black women and Hispanic women, likely due to socioeconomic factors; white women tend to have fewer children and different rates of gynecologic surgeries that affect risk for ovarian cancer.[29]
 Tentative evidence suggests that talc, pesticides, and herbicides increase the risk of ovarian cancer.[47] The American Cancer Society notes that as of now, no study has been able to accurately link any single chemical in the environment, or in the human diet, directly to mutations that cause ovarian cancer.[48]
 Other factors that have been investigated, such as smoking, low levels of vitamin D in the blood,[49] presence of inclusion ovarian cysts, and infection with human papilloma virus (the cause of some cases of cervical cancer), have been disproven as risk factors for ovarian cancer.[28][31] The carcinogenicity of perineal talc is controversial, because it can act as an irritant if it travels through the reproductive tract to the ovaries.[31][29][34] Case-control studies have shown that use of perineal talc does increase the risk of ovarian cancer, but using talc more often does not create a greater risk.[31] Use of talc elsewhere on the body is unrelated to ovarian cancer.[34] Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from epithelial ovarian cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.[50]
 Increased age (up to the 70s) is a risk factor for epithelial ovarian cancer because more mutations in cells can accumulate and eventually cause cancer. Those over 80 are at slightly lower risk.[29]
 Smoking tobacco is associated with a higher risk of mucinous ovarian cancer; after smoking cessation, the risk eventually returns to normal. Higher levels of C-reactive protein are associated with a higher risk of developing ovarian cancer.[31]
 Suppression of ovulation, which would otherwise cause damage to the ovarian epithelium and, consequently, inflammation, is generally protective. This effect can be achieved by having children, taking combined oral contraceptives, and breast feeding, all of which are protective factors.[26] A longer period of breastfeeding correlates with a larger decrease in the risk of ovarian cancer.[34] Each birth decreases risk of ovarian cancer more, and this effect is seen with up to five births. Combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by up to 50%, and the protective effect of combined oral contraceptives can last 25–30 years after they are discontinued.[29][34] Regular use of aspirin (MALOVA (MALignant OVArian cancer) study)[51][52] or acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer; other NSAIDs do not seem to have a similar protective effect.[31]
 Tubal ligation is protective because carcinogens are unable to reach the ovary and fimbriae via the vagina, uterus, and Fallopian tubes.[26] Tubal ligation is also protective in women with the BRCA1 mutation, but not the BRCA2 mutation.[31] Hysterectomy reduces the risk, and removal of both Fallopian tubes and ovaries (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) dramatically reduces the risk of not only ovarian cancer but breast cancer as well.[28] This is still a topic of research, as the link between hysterectomy and lower ovarian cancer risk is controversial. The reasons that hysterectomy may be protective have not been elucidated as of 2015.[34]
 A diet that includes large amounts of carotene, fiber, and vitamins with low amounts of fat—specifically, a diet with non-starchy vegetables (e.g. broccoli and onions) may be protective.[29] Dietary fiber is associated with a significant reduced risk of ovarian cancer.[53] A 2021 review found that green leafy vegetables, allium vegetables, fiber, flavanoids and green tea intake can significantly reduce ovarian cancer risk.[54]
 Ovarian cancer forms when errors in normal ovarian cell growth occur. Usually, when cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded, and old or damaged cells do not die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called an ovarian tumor or growth. These abnormal cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause them to grow excessively.[56] When an ovary releases an egg, the egg follicle bursts open and becomes the corpus luteum. This structure needs to be repaired by dividing cells in the ovary.[34] Continuous ovulation for a long time means more repair of the ovary by dividing cells, which can acquire mutations in each division.[29]
 Overall, the most common gene mutations in ovarian cancer occur in NF1, BRCA1, BRCA2, and CDK12. Type I ovarian cancers, which tend to be less aggressive, tend to have microsatellite instability in several genes, including both oncogenes (most notably BRAF  and KRAS) and tumor suppressors (most notably PTEN).[28] The most common mutations in Type I cancers are KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, PTEN, PIK3CA, and ARID1A.[31] Type II cancers, the more aggressive type, have different genes mutated, including p53, BRCA1, and BRCA2.[28] Low-grade cancers tend to have mutations in KRAS, whereas cancers of any grade that develop from low malignant potential tumors tend to have mutations in p53.[29] Type I cancers tend to develop from precursor lesions, whereas Type II cancers can develop from a serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma.[31] Serous cancers that have BRCA mutations also inevitably have p53 mutations, indicating that the removal of both functional genes is important for cancer to develop.[29]
 In 50% of high-grade serous cancers, homologous recombination DNA repair is dysfunctional, as are the notch and FOXM1 signaling pathways. They also almost always have p53 mutations. Other than this, mutations in high-grade serous carcinoma are hard to characterize beyond their high degree of genomic instability. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are essential for homologous recombination DNA repair, and germline mutations in these genes are found in about 15% of women with ovarian cancer.[28] The most common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the frameshift mutations that originated in a small founding population of Ashkenazi Jews.[29]
 Almost 100% of rare mucinous carcinomas have mutations in KRAS and amplifications of ERBB2 (also known as Her2/neu).[28] Overall, 20% of ovarian cancers have mutations in Her2/neu.[26]
 Serous carcinomas may develop from serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, rather than developing spontaneously from ovarian tissue. Other carcinomas develop from cortical inclusion cysts, which are groups of epithelial ovarian cells inside the stroma.[29]
 Diagnosis of ovarian cancer starts with a physical examination (including a pelvic examination), a blood test (for CA-125 and sometimes other markers), and transvaginal ultrasound.[26][57] Sometimes a rectovaginal examination is used to help plan a surgery.[29] The diagnosis must be confirmed with surgery to inspect the abdominal cavity, take biopsies (tissue samples for microscopic analysis), and look for cancer cells in the abdominal fluid. This helps to determine if an ovarian mass is benign or malignant.[26]
 Ovarian cancer's early stages (I/II) are difficult to diagnose because most symptoms are nonspecific and thus of little use in diagnosis; as a result, it is rarely diagnosed until it spreads and advances to later stages (III/IV).[58] Additionally, symptoms of ovarian cancer may appear similar to irritable bowel syndrome. In women in whom pregnancy is a possibility, BHCG level can be measured during the diagnosis process. Serum alpha-fetoprotein, neuron-specific enolase, and lactate dehydrogenase can be measured in young girls and adolescents with suspected ovarian tumors as younger women with ovarian cancer are more likely to have malignant germ cell tumors.[26][31]
 A physical examination, including a pelvic examination, and a pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal or otherwise) are both essential for diagnosis: physical examination may reveal increased abdominal girth and/or ascites (fluid within the abdominal cavity), while pelvic examination may reveal an ovarian or abdominal mass.[28] An adnexal mass is a significant finding that often indicates ovarian cancer, especially if it is fixed, nodular, irregular, solid, and/or bilateral. 13–21% of adnexal masses are caused by malignancy; however, there are other benign causes of adnexal masses, including ovarian follicular cyst, leiomyoma, endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy, hydrosalpinx, tuboovarian abscess, ovarian torsion, dermoid cyst, cystadenoma (serous or mucinous), diverticular or appendiceal abscess, nerve sheath tumor, pelvic kidney, ureteral or bladder diverticulum, benign cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum, peritoneal tuberculosis, or paraovarian cyst. Ovaries that can be felt are also a sign of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women. Other parts of a physical examination for suspected ovarian cancer can include a breast examination and a digital rectal exam. Palpation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes may reveal lymphadenopathy, which can be indicative of metastasis. Another indicator may be the presence of a pleural effusion, which can be noted on auscultation.[31]
 When an ovarian malignancy is included in a list of diagnostic possibilities, a limited number of laboratory tests are indicated. A complete blood count and serum electrolyte test is usually obtained;[59] when an ovarian cancer is present, these tests often show a high number of platelets (20–25% of patients) and low blood sodium levels due to chemical signals secreted by the tumor.[29] A positive test for inhibin A and inhibin B can indicate a granulosa cell tumor.[31]
 A blood test for a marker molecule called CA-125 is useful in differential diagnosis and in follow up of the disease, but it by itself has not been shown to be an effective method to screen for early-stage ovarian cancer due to its unacceptable low sensitivity and specificity.[59] CA-125 levels in premenopausal women over 200 U/mL may indicate ovarian cancer, as may any elevation in CA-125 above 35 U/mL in post-menopausal women. CA-125 levels are not accurate in early stage ovarian cancer, as half of stage I ovarian cancer patients have a normal CA-125 level.[31][29] CA-125 may also be elevated in benign (non-cancerous) conditions, including endometriosis, pregnancy, uterine fibroids, menstruation, ovarian cysts, systemic lupus erythematosus, liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, and leiomyoma.[31][60] HE4 is another candidate for ovarian cancer testing, though it has not been extensively tested. Other tumor markers for ovarian cancer include CA19-9, CA72-4, CA15-3, immunosuppressive acidic protein, haptoglobin-alpha, OVX1, mesothelin, lysophosphatidic acid, osteopontin, and fibroblast growth factor 23.[31]
 Use of blood test panels may help in diagnosis.[31][59] The OVA1 panel includes CA-125, beta-2 microglobulin, transferrin, apolipoprotein A1, and transthyretin. OVA1 above 5.0 in premenopausal women and 4.4 in postmenopausal women indicates a high risk for cancer.[29] A different set of laboratory tests is used for detecting sex cord-stromal tumors. High levels of testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, combined with other symptoms and high levels of inhibin A and inhibin B can be indicative of an SCST of any type.[32]
 Current research is looking at ways to consider tumor marker proteomics in combination with other indicators of disease (i.e. radiology and/or symptoms) to improve diagnostic accuracy. The challenge in such an approach is that the disparate prevalence of ovarian cancer means that even testing with very high sensitivity and specificity will still lead to a number of false positive results, which in turn may lead to issues such as performing surgical procedures in which cancer is not found intraoperatively.[citation needed] Genomics approaches have not yet been developed for ovarian cancer.[31]
 CT scanning is preferred to assess the extent of the tumor in the abdominopelvic cavity, though magnetic resonance imaging can also be used.[28] CT scanning can also be useful for finding omental caking or differentiating fluid from solid tumor in the abdomen, especially in low malignant potential tumors. However, it may not detect smaller tumors. Sometimes, a chest x-ray is used to detect metastases in the chest or pleural effusion. Another test for metastatic disease, though it is infrequently used, is a barium enema, which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease. Positron emission tomography, bone scans, and paracentesis are of limited use; in fact, paracentesis can cause metastases to form at the needle insertion site and may not provide useful results.[29] However, paracentesis can be used in cases where there is no pelvic mass and ascites is still present.[29] A physician suspecting ovarian cancer may also perform mammography or an endometrial biopsy (in the case of abnormal bleeding) to assess the possibility of breast malignancies and endometrial malignancy, respectively. Vaginal ultrasonography is often the first-line imaging study performed when an adnexal mass is found. Several characteristics of an adnexal mass indicate ovarian malignancy; they usually are solid, irregular, multilocular, and/or large; and they typically have papillary features, central vessels, and/or irregular internal septations.[31] However, SCST has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study.[32]
 To definitively diagnose ovarian cancer, a surgical procedure to inspect the abdomen is required. This can be an open procedure (laparotomy, incision through the abdominal wall) or keyhole surgery (laparoscopy). During this procedure, suspicious tissue is removed and sent for microscopic analysis. Usually, this includes a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, removal of a single affected ovary and Fallopian tube. Fluid from the abdominal cavity can also be analyzed for cancerous cells. If cancer is found, this procedure can also be used to determine the extent of its spread (which is a form of tumor staging).[26]
 Pafolacianine is indicated for use in adults with ovarian cancer to help identify cancerous lesions during surgery.[61] It is a diagnostic agent that is administered in the form of an intravenous injection prior to surgery.[61]
 A widely recognized method of estimating the risk of malignant ovarian cancer is the risk of malignancy index (RMI), calculated based on an initial workup.[28][62] An RMI score of over 200 or 250 is generally felt to indicate high risk for ovarian cancer.[28][31]
 The RMI is calculated as:
 Two methods can be used to determine the ultrasound score and menopausal score, with the resultant scores being referred to as RMI 1 and RMI 2, respectively, depending on what method is used.
 Ultrasound abnormalities:
 Another method for quantifying risk of ovarian cancer is the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA), which observes levels over time and determines if they are increasing rapidly enough to warrant transvaginal ultrasound.[29] The Risk of Ovarian Malignancy algorithm uses CA-125 levels and HE4 levels to calculate the risk of ovarian cancer; it may be more effective than RMI. The IOTA models can be used to estimate the probability that an adnexal tumor is malignant.[64] They include LR2 risk model, The Simple Rules risk (SRrisk) calculation and Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the Adnexa (ADNEX) model that can be used to assess risk of malignancy in an adnexal mass, based on its characteristics and risk factors. The QCancer (Ovary) algorithm is used to predict likelihood of ovarian cancer from risk factors.[31]
 Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (ORADS) is a standardized system developed by the American College of Radiology to improve the management and diagnosis of ovarian and adnexal masses. It provides a consistent framework for interpreting imaging findings, particularly from ultrasound, and assigns risk stratification categories that guide clinical decision-making. By utilizing a clear set of criteria and terminology, ORADS aims to enhance communication among healthcare providers, increase diagnostic accuracy, and ultimately improve patient outcomes in the evaluation of ovarian and adnexal pathologies. Additionally, a specialized ORADS calculator is available to facilitate reporting, helping radiologists and clinicians quickly and accurately classify findings according to the system's guidelines [65].
 Ovarian cancers are classified according to the microscopic appearance of their structures (histology or histopathology). Histology dictates many aspects of clinical treatment, management, and prognosis. The gross pathology of ovarian cancers is very similar regardless of histologic type: ovarian tumors have solid and cystic masses.[29] According to SEER, the types of ovarian cancers in women age 20 and over are:[66]
 subdivision
 Ovarian cancers are histologically and genetically divided into type I or type II. Type I cancers are of low histological grade and include endometrioid, mucinous, and clear-cell carcinomas. Type II cancers are of higher histological grade and include serous carcinoma and carcinosarcoma.[28]
 Epithelial ovarian cancer typically presents at an advanced stage and is derived from the malignant transformation of the epithelium of the ovarian surface, peritoneum, or fallopian tube.[67] It is the most common cause of gynecologic cancer death.[67] There are various types of epithelial ovarian cancer, including serous tumor, endometrioid tumor, clear-cell tumor, mucinous tumor, and undifferentiated or unclassified tumors.[68] Annually worldwide, 230,000 women will be diagnosed and 150,000 will die.[69] It has a 46% 5 year survival rate after diagnosis because of the advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis.[69] Typically, around 75% of patients are diagnosed as having an advanced stage of the disease because of the asymptomatic nature of its presentation.[69] There is a genomic predisposition to epithelial ovarian cancer and the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been found to be the causative genes in 65–75% of hereditary epithelial ovarian cancer.[69]
 Serous ovarian cancer is the most common type of epithelial ovarian cancer and it accounts for about two-thirds of cases of epithelial ovarian cancer.[28] Low-grade serous carcinoma is less aggressive than high-grade serous carcinomas, though it does not typically respond well to chemotherapy or hormonal treatments.[28] Serous carcinomas are thought to begin in the Fallopian tube.[70][71] High grade serous carcinoma accounts for 75% of all epithelial ovarian cancer.[69] About 15–20% of high grade serous carcinoma have germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.[69] Histologically, the growth pattern of high grade serous carcinoma is heterogenous and has some papillary or solid growth patterns.[69] The tumor cells are atypical with large, irregular nuclei.[69] It has a high proliferation rate.[69] 50% of the time, serous carcinomas are bilateral, and in 85% of cases, they have spread beyond the ovary at the time of diagnosis.[72]
 Serous Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinoma (STIC) is now recognized to be the precursor lesion of most so-called ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas.[72]
STIC is characterised by
 Small-cell ovarian carcinoma is rare and aggressive, with two main subtypes: hypercalcemic and pulmonary.[73] This rare malignancy most commonly affects young women under the age of 40 years old with a range between 14 months and 58 years.[73] The mean age of diagnosis of 24 years.[73] Approximately two-thirds of patients will present with paraneoplastic hypercalcemia meaning they have high blood calcium levels for an unknown reason.[73][74]  The tumor secretes Parathyroid hormone related protein which acts similarly to PTH and binds PTH receptors in the bone and kidney causing hypercalcemia.[73] Recent research has found an inactivating germline and somatic mutation of SMARCA4 gene.[73][75] The hypercalcemic subtype is very aggressive and has an overall survival rate of 16% with a recurrence rate of 65% in patients who receive treatment.[73] Patients who have spread of the disease to other parts of the body tend to die 2 years after the diagnosis.[73] Extra-ovarian spread is involved in 50% of cases and lymph node spread is present in 55% of cases.[74] The most common initial presentation is a rapidly growing unilateral pelvic mass with a mean size of 15 cm.[73] Histologically, it is characterized by many sheets of small, round, tightly packed cells with clusters, nests, and cords.[73][74] Immunohistochemistry is typically positive for vimentin, cytokeratin, CD10, p53, and WT-1.[73][75]
 Small cell ovarian carcinoma of the pulmonary subtype presents differently from the hypercalcemic subtype.[73] Typically, pulmonary small cell ovarian cancer usually affects both ovaries of older women and looks like oat-cell carcinoma of the lung.[29] The average age of disease onset is 59 years old and approximately 45% of cases are bilateral for the pulmonary subtype.[73] Additionally, several hormones can be elevated in the pulmonary subtype including serotonin, somatostatin, insulin, gastrin, and calcitonin.[73]
 Primary peritoneal carcinomas develop from the peritoneum, a membrane that covers the abdominal cavity that has the same embryonic origin as the ovary. They are often discussed and classified with ovarian cancers when they affect the ovary.[70][76] They can develop even after the ovaries have been removed and may appear similar to mesothelioma.[29]
 Ovarian clear-cell carcinoma is a rare subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer. Those diagnosed with ovarian clear-cell carcinoma are typically younger at the age of diagnosis and diagnosed at earlier stages than other subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer.[77][78] The highest incidence of clear-cell carcinoma of the ovary have been observed among young Asian women, especially those of Korean, Taiwanese, and Japanese background.[77][78] Endometriosis has been linked to being the main risk factor for the development of clear-cell carcinoma of the ovary and has been found to be present in 50% of women diagnosed with clear-cell carcinoma of the ovary.[77] The development of clots in the legs such as deep vein thromboembolism or in the lungs with pulmonary embolism is reported to be 40% higher in patients with clear-cell carcinoma than other epithelial ovarian cancer subtypes.[78] Mutations in molecular pathways such as ARID1A, PIK3, and PIK3CA have been found to be linked to clear-cell carcinoma.[77][78] They typically present as a large, unilateral mass, with a mean size between 13 and 15 cm.[77] 90% of cases are unilateral.[77] Ovarian clear-cell carcinoma does not typically respond well to chemotherapy due to intrinsic chemoresistance, therefore treatment is typically with aggressive cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy.[28][77]
 Clear-cell adenocarcinomas are histopathologically similar to other clear-cell carcinomas, with clear cells and hobnail cells. They represent approximately 5–10% of epithelial ovarian cancers and are associated with endometriosis in the pelvic cavity. They are typically early-stage and therefore curable by surgery, but advanced clear-cell adenocarcinomas (approximately 20%) have a poor prognosis and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy.[29]
 Endometrioid adenocarcinomas make up approximately 13–15% of all ovarian cancers.[79] Because they are typically low-grade, endometrioid adenocarcinomas have a good prognosis.[79] The median age of diagnosis is around 53 years of age.[79] These tumors frequently co-occur with endometriosis or endometrial cancer.[29][79] Cancer antigen 125 levels are typically elevated and a family history of a first degree relative with endometrioid ovarian cancer is associated with increased risk of developing endometrioid ovarian cancer.[79] The average tumor size is larger than 10 cm.[79]
 Mixed müllerian tumors make up less than 1% of ovarian cancer. They have epithelial and mesenchymal cells visible and tend to have a poor prognosis.[29]
 Mucinous tumors include mucinous adenocarcinoma and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.[29]
 Mucinous adenocarcinomas make up 5–10% of epithelial ovarian cancers. Histologically, they are similar to intestinal or cervical adenocarcinomas and are often actually metastases of appendiceal or colon cancers. Advanced mucinous adenocarcinomas have a poor prognosis, generally worse than serous tumors, and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy, though they are rare.[29]
 Pseudomyxoma peritonei refers to a collection of encapsulated mucous or gelatinous material in the abdominopelvic cavity, which is very rarely caused by a primary mucinous ovarian tumor. More commonly, it is associated with ovarian metastases of intestinal cancer.[29]
 Undifferentiated cancers - those where the cell type cannot be determined - make up about 10% of epithelial ovarian cancers and have a comparatively poor prognosis.[29][70] When examined under the microscope, these tumors have very abnormal cells that are arranged in clumps or sheets. Usually there are recognizable clumps of serous cells inside the tumor.[29]
 Malignant Brenner tumors are rare. Histologically, they have dense fibrous stroma with areas of transitional epithelium and some squamous differentiation. To be classified as a malignant Brenner tumor, it must have Brenner tumor foci and transitional cell carcinoma. The transitional cell carcinoma component is typically poorly differentiated and resembles urinary tract cancer.[29]
 Transitional cell carcinomas represent less than 5% of ovarian cancers. Histologically, they appear similar to bladder carcinoma. The prognosis is intermediate - better than most epithelial cancers but worse than malignant Brenner tumors.[29]
 Sex cord-stromal tumor, including estrogen-producing granulosa cell tumor, the benign thecoma, and virilizing Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor or arrhenoblastoma, accounts for 7% of ovarian cancers. They occur most frequently in women between 50 and 69 years of age but can occur in women of any age, including young girls. They are not typically aggressive and are usually unilateral;[26] they are therefore usually treated with surgery alone. Sex cord-stromal tumors are the main hormone-producing ovarian tumors.[32]
 Several different cells from the mesenchyme can give rise to sex-cord or stromal tumors. These include fibroblasts and endocrine cells. The symptoms of a sex-cord or stromal ovarian tumor can differ from other types of ovarian cancer. Common signs and symptoms include ovarian torsion, hemorrhage from or rupture of the tumor, an abdominal mass, and hormonal disruption. In children, isosexual precocious pseudopuberty may occur with granulosa cell tumors since they produce estrogen. These tumors cause abnormalities in menstruation (excessive bleeding, infrequent menstruation, or no menstruation) or postmenopausal bleeding. Because these tumors produce estrogen, they can cause or occur at the same time as endometrial cancer or breast cancer. Other sex-cord/stromal tumors present with distinct symptoms. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors cause virilization and excessive hair growth due to the production of testosterone and androstenedione, which can also cause Cushing's syndrome in rare cases. Also, sex-cord stromal tumors occur that do not cause a hormonal imbalance, including benign fibromas, which cause ascites and hydrothorax.[26] With germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors are the most common ovarian cancer diagnosed in women under 20.[32]
 Granulosa cell tumors are the most common sex-cord stromal tumors, making up 70% of cases, and are divided into two histologic subtypes: adult granulosa cell tumors, which develop in women over 50, and juvenile granulosa tumors, which develop before puberty or before the age of 30. Both develop in the ovarian follicle from a population of cells that surrounds germinal cells.[32]
 Adult granulosa cell tumors are characterized by later onset (30+ years, 50 on average). These tumors produce high levels of estrogen, which causes its characteristic symptoms: menometrorrhagia; endometrial hyperplasia; tender, enlarged breasts; postmenopausal bleeding; and secondary amenorrhea. The mass of the tumor can cause other symptoms, including abdominal pain and distension, or symptoms similar to an ectopic pregnancy if the tumor bleeds and ruptures.[32]
 Sertoli-Leydig tumors are most common in women before the age of 30, and particularly common before puberty.[32]
 Sclerosing stromal tumors typically occur in girls before puberty or women before the age of 30.[32]
 Germ cell tumors of the ovary develop from the ovarian germ cells.[70] Germ cell tumor accounts for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are teratomas and most teratomas are benign. Malignant teratomas tend to occur in older women, when one of the germ layers in the tumor develops into a squamous cell carcinoma.[26] Germ-cell tumors tend to occur in young women (20s–30s) and girls, making up 70% of the ovarian cancer seen in that age group.[33] Germ-cell tumors can include dysgerminomas, teratomas, yolk sac tumors/endodermal sinus tumors, and choriocarcinomas, when they arise in the ovary. Some germ-cell tumors have an isochromosome 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other.[26] Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They are more likely to be stage I at diagnosis.[32] Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: choriocarcinomas are monitored with beta-HCG and endodermal sinus tumors with alpha-fetoprotein.[26]
 Germ-cell tumors are typically discovered when they become large, palpable masses. However, like sex cord tumors, they can cause ovarian torsion or hemorrhage and, in children, isosexual precocious puberty. They frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes, especially para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes.[26] The most common symptom of germ cell tumors is subacute abdominal pain caused by the tumor bleeding, necrotizing, or stretching the ovarian capsule. If the tumor ruptures, causes significant bleeding, or torses the ovary, it can cause acute abdominal pain, which occurs in less than 10% of those with germ-cell tumors. They can also secrete hormones which change the menstrual cycle. In 25% of germ-cell tumors, the cancer is discovered during a routine examination and does not cause symptoms.[32]
 Diagnosing germ cell tumors may be difficult because the normal menstrual cycle and puberty can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of teen pregnancy. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, karyotype, human chorionic gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring gonadal dysgenesis. A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign ovarian cyst.[32]
 Dysgerminoma accounts for 35% of ovarian cancer in young women and is the most likely germ cell tumor to metastasize to the lymph nodes; nodal metastases occur in 25–30% of cases.[33][32] These tumors may have mutations in the KIT gene, a mutation known for its role in gastrointestinal stromal tumor. People with an XY karyotype and ovaries (gonadal dysgenesis) or an X,0 karyotype and ovaries (Turner syndrome) who develop a unilateral dysgerminoma are at risk for a gonadoblastoma in the other ovary, and in this case, both ovaries are usually removed when a unilateral dysgerminoma is discovered to avoid the risk of another malignant tumor. Gonadoblastomas in people with Swyer or Turner syndrome become malignant in approximately 40% of cases. However, in general, dysgerminomas are bilateral 10–20% of the time.[26][32]
 They are composed of cells that cannot differentiate further and develop directly from germ cells or from gonadoblastomas. Dysgerminomas contain syncytiotrophoblasts in approximately 5% of cases, and can therefore cause elevated hCG levels. On gross appearance, dysgerminomas are typically pink to tan-colored, have multiple lobes, and are solid. Microscopically, they appear identical to seminomas and very close to embryonic primordial germ cells, having large, polyhedral, rounded clear cells. The nuclei are uniform and round or square with prominent nucleoli and the cytoplasm has high levels of glycogen. Inflammation is another prominent histologic feature of dysgerminomas.[32]
 Choriocarcinoma can occur as a primary ovarian tumor developing from a germ cell, though it is usually a gestational disease that metastasizes to the ovary. Primary ovarian choriocarcinoma has a poor prognosis and can occur without a pregnancy. They produce high levels of hCG and can cause early puberty in children or menometrorrhagia (irregular, heavy menstruation) after menarche.[32]
 Immature, or solid, teratomas are the most common type of ovarian germ cell tumor, making up 40–50% of cases. Teratomas are characterized by the presence of disorganized tissues arising from all three embryonic germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm; immature teratomas also have undifferentiated stem cells that make them more malignant than mature teratomas (dermoid cysts). The different tissues are visible on gross pathology and often include bone, cartilage, hair, mucus, or sebum, but these tissues are not visible from the outside, which appears to be a solid mass with lobes and cysts. Histologically, they have large amounts of neuroectoderm organized into sheets and tubules along with glia; the amount of neural tissue determines the histologic grade. Immature teratomas usually only affect one ovary (10% co-occur with dermoid cysts) and usually metastasize throughout the peritoneum. They can also cause mature teratoma implants to grow throughout the abdomen in a disease called growing teratoma syndrome; these are usually benign but will continue to grow during chemotherapy, and often necessitate further surgery. Unlike mature teratomas, immature teratomas form many adhesions, making them less likely to cause ovarian torsion. There is no specific marker for immature teratomas, but carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA-125, CA19-9, or AFP can sometimes indicate an immature teratoma.[32]
 Stage I teratomas make up the majority (75%) of cases and have the best prognosis, with 98% of patients surviving five years; if a Stage I tumor is also grade 1, it can be treated with unilateral surgery only. Stage II though IV tumors make up the remaining quarter of cases and have a worse prognosis,  with 73–88% of patients surviving five years.[32]
 Mature teratomas, or dermoid cysts, are rare tumors consisting of mostly benign tissue that develop after menopause. The tumors consist of disorganized tissue with nodules of malignant tissue, which can be of various types. The most common malignancy is squamous cell carcinoma, but adenocarcinoma, basal-cell carcinoma, carcinoid tumor, neuroectodermal tumor, malignant melanoma, sarcoma, sebaceous tumor, and struma ovarii can also be part of the dermoid cyst. They are treated with surgery and adjuvant platinum chemotherapy or radiation.[32]
 Yolk sac tumors, formerly called endodermal sinus tumors, make up approximately 10–20% of ovarian germ cell malignancies, and have the worst prognosis of all ovarian germ cell tumors. They occur both before menarche (in one-third of cases) and after menarche (the remaining two-thirds of cases). Half of the people with yolk sac tumors are diagnosed in stage I. Typically, they are unilateral until metastasis, which occurs within the peritoneal cavity and via the bloodstream to the lungs. Yolk sac tumors grow quickly and recur easily, and are not easily treatable once they have recurred. Stage I yolk sac tumors are highly treatable, with a 5-year disease-free survival rate of 93%, but stage II-IV tumors are less treatable, with survival rates of 64–91%.[32]
 Their gross appearance is solid, friable, and yellow, with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas. They also often contain cysts that can degenerate or rupture. Histologically, yolk sac tumors are characterized by the presence of Schiller-Duval bodies (which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors) and a reticular pattern. Yolk sac tumors commonly secrete alpha-fetoprotein and can be immunohistochemically stained for its presence; the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood is a useful marker of recurrence.[32]
 Embryonal carcinomas, a rare tumor type usually found in mixed tumors, develop directly from germ cells but are not terminally differentiated; in rare cases, they may develop in dysgenetic gonads. They can develop further into a variety of other neoplasms, including choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. They occur in younger people, with an average age at diagnosis of 14, and secrete both alpha-fetoprotein (in 75% of cases) and hCG.[32]
 Histologically, embryonal carcinoma appears similar to the embryonic disc, made up of epithelial, anaplastic cells in disorganized sheets, with gland-like spaces and papillary structures.[32]
 Polyembryomas, the most immature form of teratoma and very rare ovarian tumors, are histologically characterized by having several embryo-like bodies with structures resembling a germ disk, yolk sac, and amniotic sac. Syncytiotrophoblast giant cells also occur in polyembryomas.[32]
 Primary ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are rare and have a poor prognosis when advanced. More typically, ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are cervical metastases, areas of differentiation in an endometrioid tumor, or derived from a mature teratoma.[29]
 Mixed tumors contain elements of more than one of the above classes of tumor histology. To be classed as a mixed tumor, the minor type must make up more than 10% of the tumor.[31] Though mixed carcinomas can have any combination of cell types, mixed ovarian cancers are typically serous/endometrioid or clear-cell/endometrioid.[29] Mixed germ cell tumors make up approximately 25–30% of all germ cell ovarian cancers, with combinations of dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumor, and/or immature teratoma. The prognosis and treatment vary based on the component cell types.[32]
 Ovarian cancer can also be a secondary cancer, the result of metastasis from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body.[26] About 5–30% of ovarian cancers are due to metastases, while the rest are primary cancers.[80] Common primary cancers are breast cancer, colon cancer, appendiceal cancer, and stomach cancer (primary gastric cancers that metastasize to the ovary are called Krukenberg tumors).[26] Krukenberg tumors have signet ring cells and mucinous cells.[29] Endometrial cancer and lymphomas can also metastasize to the ovary.[81]
 Ovarian borderline tumors, sometimes called low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, have some benign and some malignant features.[29] LMP tumors make up approximately 10–15% of all ovarian tumors.[31][70] They develop earlier than epithelial ovarian cancer, around the age of 40–49. They typically do not have extensive invasion; 10% of LMP tumors have areas of stromal microinvasion (<3mm, <5% of tumor). LMP tumors have other abnormal features, including increased mitosis, changes in cell size or nucleus size, abnormal nuclei, cell stratification, and small projections on cells (papillary projections). Serous and/or mucinous characteristics can be seen on histological examination, and serous histology makes up the overwhelming majority of advanced LMP tumors. More than 80% of LMP tumors are Stage I; 15% are stage II and III and less than 5% are stage IV.[29] Implants of LMP tumors are often non-invasive.[70]
 Ovarian cancer is staged using the FIGO staging system and uses information obtained after surgery, which can include a total abdominal hysterectomy via midline laparotomy, removal of (usually) both ovaries and Fallopian tubes, (usually) the omentum, pelvic (peritoneal) washings, assessment of retroperitoneal lymph nodes (including the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes), appendectomy in suspected mucinous tumors, and pelvic/peritoneal biopsies for cytopathology.[28][26][31][82] Around 30% of ovarian cancers that appear confined to the ovary have metastasized microscopically, which is why even stage-I cancers must be staged completely.[26] 22% of cancers presumed to be stage I are observed to have lymphatic metastases.[31] The AJCC stage is the same as the FIGO stage. The AJCC staging system describes the extent of the primary tumor (T), the absence or presence of metastasis to nearby lymph nodes (N), and the absence or presence of distant metastasis (M).[83] The most common stage at diagnosis is stage IIIc, with over 70% of diagnoses.[26]
 The AJCC/TNM staging system indicates where the tumor has developed, spread to lymph nodes, and metastasis.[31]
 The AJCC/TNM stages can be correlated with the FIGO stages:[31]
 Grade 1 tumors have well differentiated cells (look very similar to the normal tissue) and are the ones with the best prognosis. Grade 2 tumors are also called moderately well-differentiated and they are made up of cells that resemble the normal tissue. Grade 3 tumors have the worst prognosis and their cells are abnormal, referred to as poorly differentiated.[84]
 Metastasis in ovarian cancer is very common in the abdomen and occurs via exfoliation, where cancer cells burst through the ovarian capsule and are able to move freely throughout the peritoneal cavity. Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the lymphatic system and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the infundibulopelvic ligament, the broad ligament, and the round ligament. The most commonly affected groups include the paraaortic, hypogastric, external iliac, obturator, and inguinal lymph nodes. Usually, ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is a recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.[29]
 Women with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure. This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in women at high risk. Women with BRCA gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of Fallopian tube cancer. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.[26][85]
 Because a large fraction of ovarian cancers originate in the fallopian tubes,[86] the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology now recommend that women who are not planning on having additional children and who are undergoing surgical procedures such as tubal ligation (having one's ""tubes tied"") undergo opportunistic salpingo-oophorectomy — i.e. simultaneously having their fallopian tubes removed.[87] OVCARE — BC Cancer's multi-institutional and multidisciplinary ovarian research group — began recommending salpingectomy at the time of hysterectomy and in place of tubal ligation in 2010.[88]
 Women with a significant family history for ovarian cancer are often referred to a genetic counselor to see if testing for BRCA mutations would be beneficial.[29] The use of oral contraceptives, the absence of 'periods' during the menstrual cycle, and tubal ligation reduce the risk.[89]
There may an association of developing ovarian cancer and ovarian stimulation during infertility treatments. Endometriosis has been linked to ovarian cancers. Human papillomavirus infection, smoking, and talc have not been identified as increasing the risk for developing ovarian cancer.[28]
 There is no simple and reliable way to test for ovarian cancer in women who do not have any signs or symptoms. Screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks.[19] Women with high risk of ovarian cancer that are currently identified based on family history and genetic testing may benefit from screening.[90] The Pap test does not screen for ovarian cancer.[27]
 Ovarian cancer is usually only palpable in advanced stages.[29] This high risk group has benefited with earlier detection.[28][26][85]  Screening is not recommended using CA-125 measurements, HE4 levels, ultrasound, or adnexal palpation in women who are at average risk. Currently there is no national screening programme in the UK for ovarian cancer. CA125 and transvaginal ultrasound can be utilised but there is minimal evidence to suggest this decreases mortality . More recently, the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROMA) has been shown to detect earlier cancers using CA125 and age but again does not provide a robust measure to decrease mortality at present.[91]
 Ovarian cancer has low prevalence, even in the high-risk group of women from the ages of 50 to 60 (about one in 2000), and screening of women with average risk is more likely to give ambiguous results than detect a problem that requires treatment. Because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of average risk, the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits. The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage when it is more likely to be treated successfully.[26][85]
 Screening with transvaginal ultrasound, pelvic examination, and CA-125 levels can be used instead of preventive surgery in women who have BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. This strategy has shown some success.[29]
 Screening for CA125, a chemical released by ovarian tumours, with follow-up using ultrasound, was shown to be ineffective in reducing mortality in a large-scale UK study.[92]
 There have been some screening trials that have used age, family history of ovarian cancer, and mutation status to identify target populations for screening.[90]
 Once it is determined that ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer is present, treatment is scheduled by a gynecologic oncologist (a physician trained to treat cancers of a woman's reproductive system). Gynecologic oncologists can perform surgery on and give chemotherapy to women with ovarian cancer. A treatment plan is developed.[93]
 Treatment usually involves surgery and chemotherapy, and sometimes radiotherapy, regardless of the subtype of ovarian cancer.[70][94] Surgical treatment may be sufficient for well-differentiated malignant tumors and confined to the ovary. Addition of chemotherapy may be required for more aggressive tumors confined to the ovary. For patients with advanced disease, a combination of surgical reduction with a combination chemotherapy regimen is standard.  Since 1980, platinum-based drugs have had an important role in treating ovarian cancer.[citation needed] Borderline tumors, even following spread outside of the ovary, are managed well with surgery, and chemotherapy is not seen as useful.[95] Second-look surgery and maintenance chemotherapy have not been shown to provide benefit.[29]
 Surgery has been the standard of care for decades and may be necessary for obtaining a specimen for diagnosis.  The surgery depends upon the extent of nearby invasion of other tissues by the cancer when it is diagnosed. This extent of the cancer is described by assigning it a stage, the presumed type, and the grade of cancer. The gynecological surgeon may remove one (unilateral oophorectomy) or both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy). The Fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), uterus (hysterectomy), and the omentum (omentectomy) may also be removed. Typically, all of these organs are removed.[96]
 For those who test positive for faulty BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes having a risk-reducing surgery is an option. An increasing number of women choose this. At the same time the average waiting time for undergoing the procedure is two-years which is much longer than recommended.[97][98]
 For low-grade, unilateral stage-IA cancers, only the involved ovary (which must be unruptured) and Fallopian tube will be removed. This can be done especially in young people who wish to preserve their fertility. However, a risk of microscopic metastases exists and staging must be completed.[28] If any metastases are found, a second surgery to remove the remaining ovary and uterus is needed.[95] Tranexamic acid can be administered prior to surgery to reduce the need for blood transfusions due to blood loss during the surgery.[31]
 If a tumor in a premenopausal woman is determined to be a low malignant potential tumor during surgery, and it is clearly stage I cancer, only the affected ovary is removed. For postmenopausal women with low malignant potential tumors, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is still the preferred option. During staging, the appendix can be examined or removed. This is particularly important with mucinous tumors.[29] In children or adolescents with ovarian cancer, surgeons typically attempt to preserve one ovary to allow for the completion of puberty, but if the cancer has spread, this is not always possible. Dysgerminomas, in particular, tend to affect both ovaries: 8–15% of dysgerminomas are present in both ovaries.[33] People with low-grade (well-differentiated) tumors are typically treated only with surgery,[26] which is often curative.[70] In general, germ cell tumors can be treated with unilateral surgery unless the cancer is widespread or fertility is not a factor.[32] In women with surgically staged advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stages III and IV), studies suggest all attempts should be made to reach complete cytoreduction (surgical efforts to remove the bulk of the tumor).[99]
 In advanced cancers, where complete removal is not an option, as much tumor as possible is removed in a procedure called debulking surgery. This surgery is not always successful, and is less likely to be successful in women with extensive metastases in the peritoneum, stage- IV disease, cancer in the transverse fissure of the liver, mesentery, or diaphragm, and large areas of ascites. Debulking surgery has usually only been done once[28] but a recent study has shown a longer overall survival in recurrent ovarian cancer when surgery combined with chemotherapy was performed compared to treatment with chemotherapy alone.[100] Computed tomography (abdominal CT) is often used to assess if primary debulking surgery is possible, but low certainty evidence also suggests fluorodeoxyglucose‐18 (FDG) PET/CT and MRI may be useful as an addition for assessing macroscopic incomplete debulking.[101] More complete debulking is associated with better outcomes: women with no macroscopic evidence of disease after debulking have a median survival of 39 months, as opposed to 17 months with less complete surgery.[26] By removing metastases, many cells that are resistant to chemotherapy are removed, and any clumps of cells that have died are also removed. This allows chemotherapy to better reach the remaining cancer cells, which are more likely to be fast-growing and therefore chemosensitive.[29]
 Interval debulking surgery is another protocol used, where neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given, debulking surgery is performed, and chemotherapy is finished after debulking.[95] Though no definitive studies have been completed, it is shown to be approximately equivalent to primary debulking surgery in terms of survival and shows slightly lower morbidity.[29] Previous studies have shown different results from primary debulking versus interval debulking. The ongoing TRUST study may clarify selection criteria for each surgical approach.[102]
 There are several different surgical procedures that can be employed to treat ovarian cancer. For stage I and II cancer, laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery can be used, but metastases may not be found. For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending on the extent of the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system, omentectomy, splenectomy, bowel resection, diaphragm stripping or resection, appendectomy, or even a posterior pelvic exenteration.[29]
 To fully stage ovarian cancer, lymphadenectomy can be included in the surgery, However, it has not offered benefits in terms of survival in either HGSOC[103] or LGSOC.[104] This is particularly important in germ cell tumors because they frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes.[26]
 If ovarian cancer recurs, secondary surgery is sometimes a treatment option. This depends on how easily the tumor can be removed, how much fluid has accumulated in the abdomen, and overall health.[28] Effectivenes of this surgery depends on surgical technique, completeness of cytoreduction, and extent of disease.[105] It also can be helpful in people who had their first surgery done by a generalist and in epithelial ovarian cancer.[31] Secondary surgery can be effective in dysgerminomas and immature teratomas.[32] Evidence suggests surgery in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer may be associated with prolonging life in some women with platinum-sensitive disease.[106]
 The major side effect of oophorectomy in younger women is early menopause, which can cause osteoporosis. After surgery, hormone replacement therapy can be considered, especially in younger women. This therapy can consist of a combination of estrogen and progesterone, or estrogen alone. Estrogen alone is safe after hysterectomy; when the uterus is still present, unopposed estrogen dramatically raises the risk of endometrial cancer.[28] Estrogen therapy after surgery does not change survival rates.[31] People having ovarian cancer surgery are typically hospitalized afterwards for 3–4 days and spend around a month recovering at home.[107] Surgery outcomes are best at hospitals that do a large number of ovarian cancer surgeries.[29]
 It is unclear if laparoscopy or laparotomy is better or worse for FIGO stage I ovarian cancer.[108] There is also no apparent difference between total abdominal hysterectomy and supracervical hysterectomy for advanced cancers. Approximately 2.8% of people having a first surgery for advanced ovarian cancer die within two weeks of the surgery (2.8% perioperative mortality rate).[31] More aggressive surgeries are associated with better outcomes in advanced (stage III or IV) ovarian cancer.[29]
 Chemotherapy has been a general standard of care for ovarian cancer for decades, although with variable protocols. Chemotherapy is used after surgery to treat any residual disease, if appropriate.  In some cases, there may be reason to perform chemotherapy first, followed by surgery. This is called ""neoadjuvant chemotherapy"", and is common when a tumor cannot be completely removed or optimally debulked via surgery. Though it has not been shown to increase survival, it can reduce the risk of complications after surgery. If a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or other surgery is performed, additional chemotherapy, called ""adjuvant chemotherapy"", can be given.[28][31] Adjuvant chemotherapy is used in stage 1 cancer typically if the tumor is of a high histologic grade (grade 3) or the highest substage (stage 1c), provided the cancer has been optimally staged during surgery.[31][95] Bevacizumab may be used as an adjuvant chemotherapy if the tumor is not completely removed during surgery or if the cancer is stage IV; it can extend progression-free survival but has not been shown to extend overall survival.[31] Chemotherapy is curative in approximately 20% of advanced ovarian cancers;[29] it is more often curative with malignant germ cell tumors than epithelial tumors.[32] Adjuvant chemotherapy has been found to improve survival and reduce the risk of ovarian cancer recurring compared to no adjuvant therapy in women with early stage epithelial ovarian cancer.[109]
 Chemotherapy in ovarian cancer typically consists of platins, a group of platinum-based drugs, combined with non-platins.[110] Platinum-based drugs have been used since 1980.  Common therapies can include paclitaxel, cisplatin, topotecan, doxorubicin, epirubicin, and gemcitabine. Carboplatin is typically given in combination with either paclitaxel or docetaxel; the typical combination is carboplatin with paclitaxel.[28][31] Carboplatin is superior to cisplatin in that it is less toxic and has fewer side effects, generally allowing for an improved quality of life in comparison, though both are similarly effective.[31] Three-drug regimens have not been found to be more effective,[28] and platins alone or nonplatins alone are less effective than platins and nonplatins in combination.[31] There is a small benefit in platinum‐based chemotherapy compared with non‐platinum therapy.[111] Platinum combinations can offer improved survival over single platinum. In people with relapsed ovarian cancer, evidence suggests topotecan has a similar effect on overall survival as paclitaxel and topotecan plus thalidomide, whilst it is superior to treosulfan and not as effective as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in platinum-sensitive people.[112]
 Chemotherapy can be given intravenously or in the peritoneal cavity.[26] Though intraperitoneal chemotherapy is associated with longer progression-free survival and overall survival, it also causes more adverse side effects than intravenous chemotherapy.[31] It is mainly used when the cancer has been optimally debulked. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy can be highly effective because ovarian cancer mainly spreads inside the peritoneal cavity, and higher doses of the drugs can reach the tumors this way.[29]
 Chemotherapy can cause anemia; intravenous iron has been found to be more effective than oral iron supplements in reducing the need for blood transfusions.[31] Typical cycles of treatment involve one treatment every 3 weeks, repeated for 6 weeks or more.[113] Fewer than 6 weeks (cycles) of treatment is less effective than 6 weeks or more.[31] Germ-cell malignancies are treated differently than other ovarian cancers — a regimen of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) is used with 5 days of chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for 3 to 4 cycles.[26][32] Chemotherapy for germ cell tumors has not been shown to cause amenorrhea, infertility, birth defects, or miscarriage.[32] Maintenance chemotherapy has not been shown to be effective.[31]
 In people with BRCA mutations, platinum chemotherapy is more effective.[28] Germ-cell tumors and malignant sex-cord/stromal tumors are treated with chemotherapy, though dysgerminomas and sex-cord tumors are not typically very responsive.[26][33]
 If ovarian cancer recurs, it is considered partially platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant, based on the time since the last recurrence treated with platins: partially platinum-sensitive cancers recurred 6–12 months after last treatment, and platinum-resistant cancers have an interval of less than 6 months. Second-line chemotherapy can be given after the cancer becomes symptomatic because no difference in survival is seen between treating asymptomatic (elevated CA-125) and symptomatic recurrences.[medical citation needed]
 For platinum-sensitive tumors, platins are the drugs of choice for second-line chemotherapy, in combination with other cytotoxic agents. Regimens include carboplatin combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel.[26] Carboplatin-doublet therapy can be combined with paclitaxel for increased efficacy in some cases. Another potential adjuvant therapy for platinum-sensitive recurrences is olaparib, which may improve progression-free survival but has not been shown to improve overall survival.[31] (Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA for use in BRCA-associated ovarian cancer that had previously been treated with chemotherapy.[114][115]) For recurrent germ cell tumors, an additional 4 cycles of BEP chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for those who have been treated with surgery or platins.
 If the tumor is determined to be platinum-resistant, vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) or some combination of paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin may be used as a second-line therapy.[32]
 For platinum-resistant tumors, there are no high-efficacy chemotherapy options. Single-drug regimens (doxorubicin or topotecan) do not have high response rates,[28] but single-drug regimens of topotecan, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or gemcitabine are used in some cases.[26][31] Topotecan cannot be used in people with an intestinal blockage. Paclitaxel used alone is another possible regimen, or it may be combined with liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, cisplatin, topotecan, etoposide, or cyclophosphamide.[113] ( See also Palliative care below.)
 Novel agents are being developed to inhibit the development of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) for women with ovarian cancer who develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs. As of 2023 there would appear to be a role for these treatments but due to the additional treatment burden and cost of maintenance treatments the risk versus benefits require careful consideration.[116]
 Novocure sponsored a phase-2 trial proving efficacy of tumor treating fields in recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma, in conjunction with weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy.[45]
 Dysgerminomas are most effectively treated with radiation,[33] though this can cause infertility and is being phased out in favor of chemotherapy.[26] Radiation therapy does not improve survival in people with well-differentiated tumors.[26]
 In stage 1c and 2 cancers, radiation therapy is used after surgery if there is the possibility of residual disease in the pelvis but the abdomen is cancer-free. Radiotherapy can also be used in palliative care of advanced cancers. A typical course of radiotherapy for ovarian cancer is 5 days a week for 3–4 weeks. Common side effects of radiotherapy include diarrhea, constipation, and frequent urination.[117]
 Despite the fact that 60% of ovarian tumors have estrogen receptors, ovarian cancer is only rarely responsive to hormonal treatments. A Cochrane review found a lack of evidence about the effects of tamoxifen in people with relapsed ovarian cancer.[118] Estrogen alone does not have an effect on the cancer, and tamoxifen and letrozole are rarely effective.[28] ""Some women with borderline malignancy ovarian cancer and stromal ovarian cancer may receive hormonal therapy.""[96]
 Immunotherapy is a topic of current research in ovarian cancer. In some cases, the antibody drug bevacizumab, though still a topic of active research, is used to treat advanced cancer along with chemotherapy.[95] It has been approved for this use in the European Union.[119]
 Specific follow-up depends on, for example, the type and stage of ovarian cancer, the treatment, and the presence of any symptoms. Usually, a check-up appointment is made about every 2 to 3 months initially, followed by twice per year for up to 5 years.[120] For epithelial ovarian cancers, the most common test upon follow-up is CA-125 level. However, treatment based only on elevated CA-125 levels and not any symptoms can increase side effects without any prolongation of life, so the implication of the outcome of a CA-125 test can be discussed before taking it.[121] The recommendation as of 2014 is recurrent cancer may be present if the CA-125 level is twice normal.[28] Treating a recurrence detected by CA-125 does not improve survival.[31]
 For women with germ-cell tumors, follow-up tests generally include alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and/or human chorionic gonadotropin. For women with stromal cancers, tests for hormones like estrogen, testosterone, and inhibin are sometimes helpful.[121] Inhibin can also be useful for monitoring the progress of sex-cord tumors, along with Müllerian inhibiting substance. AFP can also be used to monitor Sertoli-Leydig tumors.[26] In dysgerminomas, lactate dehydrogenase and its two isozymes (LDH-1 and LDH-2) are used to test for recurrence.[32]
 Women with ovarian cancer may not need routine surveillance imaging to monitor the cancer unless new symptoms appear or tumor markers begin rising.[122] Imaging without these indications is discouraged because it is unlikely to detect a recurrence, improve survival, and because it has its own costs and side effects.[122] However, CT imaging can be used if desired, though this is not common.[28] If a tumor is easily imaged, imaging may be used to monitor the progress of treatment.[123]
 Palliative care focuses on relieving symptoms and increasing or maintaining quality of life. This type of treatment's purpose is not to cure the cancer but to make the woman more comfortable while living with cancer that can not be cured. It has been recommended as part of the treatment plan for any person with advanced ovarian cancer or patients with significant symptoms.[124] In platinum-refractory and platinum-resistant cases, other palliative chemotherapy is the main treatment.[29][96]
 Palliative care can entail treatment of symptoms and complications of the cancer, including pain, nausea, constipation, ascites, bowel obstruction, edema, pleural effusion, and mucositis.  Especially if the cancer advances and becomes incurable, treatment of symptoms becomes one of the main goals of therapy.  Palliative care can also entail helping with decision-making such as if or when hospice care is appropriate, and the preferred place for the patient at end of life care.[31]
 Bowel obstruction can be treated with palliative surgery (colostomy, ileostomy, or internal bypass) or medicine, but surgery has been shown to increase survival time.[28][31] Palliative surgery may result in short bowel syndrome, enterocutaneous fistula, or re-obstruction; or may not be possible due to the extent of obstruction.[29] Other treatments of complications can include total parenteral nutrition, a low-residue diet, palliative gastrostomy, and adequate pain control.[28] Bowel obstruction can also be treated with octreotide when palliative surgery is not an option. Cancer can also block the ureters, which can be relieved by a nephrostomy or a ureteric stent. Ascites can be relieved by repeated paracentesis or placement of a drain to increase comfort.[125] Pleural effusions can be treated in a similar manner, with repeated thoracentesis, pleurodesis, or placement of a drain.[29]
 Radiation therapy can be used as part of the palliative care of advanced ovarian cancer, since it can help to shrink tumors that are causing symptoms.[96] Palliative radiotherapy typically lasts for only a few treatments, a much shorter course of therapy than non-palliative radiotherapy.[117] It is also used for palliation of chemotherapy-resistant germ cell tumors.[32]
 Ovarian cancer has a significant effect on quality of life, psychological health and well-being. Interventions are available to help with the needs and social support. Many ovarian cancer survivors report a good quality of life and optimism. Others reported a ""spiritual change"" that helped them find meaning during their experience. Others have described their loss of faith after their diagnosis with ovarian cancer. Those who have gone through treatment sometimes experience social isolation but benefit from having relationships with other survivors. Frustration and guilt have been described by some who have expressed their inability to care for their family.[126]
 Self-esteem and body image changes can occur due to hair loss, removal of ovaries and other reproductive structures, and scars. There is some improvement after hair grows in. Sexual issues can develop. The removal of ovaries results in surgically induced menopause that can result in painful intercourse, vaginal dryness, loss of sexual desire and being tired. Though prognosis is better for younger survivors, the impact on sexuality can still be substantial.[126]
 Anxiety, depression and distress is present in those surviving ovarian cancer at higher rates than in the general population.[126][127] The same psychosocial problems can develop in family members. Emotional effects can include a fear of death, sadness, memory problems and difficulty in concentrating. When optimism was adopted by those at the beginning of their treatment, they were less likely to develop distress. Those who have fear of the cancer recurring may have difficulty in expressing joy even when disease-free. The more treatments that a woman undergoes, the more likely the loss of hope is expressed. Women often can cope and reduce negative psychosocial effects by a number of strategies. Activities such as traveling, spending additional time with family and friends, ignoring statistics, journaling and increasing involvement in spiritually-based events are adaptive.[126]
 Women with ovarian cancer may also experience difficulties with their diet and are at risk of malnutrition.[128]
 Ovarian cancer usually has a relatively poor prognosis. It is disproportionately deadly because it lacks any clear early detection or screening test, meaning most cases are not diagnosed until they have reached advanced stages.[122][28]
 Ovarian cancer metastasizes early in its development, often before it has been diagnosed. High-grade tumors metastasize more readily than low-grade tumors. Typically, tumor cells begin to metastasize by growing in the peritoneal cavity.[26] More than 60% of women presenting with ovarian cancer have stage-III or stage-IV cancer, when it has already spread beyond the ovaries. Ovarian cancers shed cells into the naturally occurring fluid within the abdominal cavity. These cells can then implant on other abdominal (peritoneal) structures, including the uterus, urinary bladder, bowel, lining of the bowel wall, and omentum, forming new tumor growths before cancer is even suspected.
 The five-year survival rate for all stages of ovarian cancer is 46%; the one-year survival rate is 72% and the ten-year survival rate is 35%.[130] For cases where a diagnosis is made early in the disease, when the cancer is still confined to the primary site, the five-year survival rate is 92.7%.[131] About 70% of women with advanced disease respond to initial treatment, most of whom attain complete remission, but half of these women experience a recurrence 1–4 years after treatment.[26] Brain metastasis is more common in stage III/IV cancer but can still occur in cancers staged at I/II. People with brain metastases survive a median of 8.2 months, though surgery, chemotherapy, and whole brain radiation therapy can improve survival.[31]
 Ovarian cancer survival varies significantly with subtype. Dysgerminomas have a very favorable prognosis. In early stages, they have a five-year survival rate of 96.9%.[33] Around two-thirds of dysgerminomas are diagnosed at stage I.[32] Stage-III dysgerminomas have a five-year survival of 61%; when treated with BEP chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal, dysgerminomas have a 95% two-year survival rate. Sex-cord-stromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis; because they are slow-growing, even those with metastatic disease can survive a decade or more.[26] Low malignant potential tumors usually only have a bad prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity.[29]
 Complications of ovarian cancer can include spread of the cancer to other organs, progressive function loss of various organs, ascites, and intestinal obstructions, which can be fatal. Intestinal obstructions in multiple sites are the most common proximate cause of death.[28] Intestinal obstruction in ovarian cancer can either be a true obstruction, where tumor blocks the intestinal lumen, or a pseudo-obstruction, when tumor prevents normal peristalsis.[132] Continuous accumulation of ascites can be treated by placing a drain that can be self-drained.[28]
 There are a number of prognostic factors in ovarian cancer. Positive prognostic factors – those indicating better chances of survival – include no residual disease after surgery (stage III/IV), complete macroscopic resection (stage IV), BRCA2 mutations, young age (under 45 years), nonserous type, low histologic grade, early stage, co-occurrence with endometrial cancer, and low CA-125 levels. There is conflicting evidence for BRCA1 as a prognostic factor. Conversely, negative prognostic factors – those that indicate a worse chance of survival – include rupture of the ovarian capsule during surgery, older age (over 45 years), mucinous type, stage IV, high histologic grade, clear-cell type, upper abdominal involvement, high CA-125 levels, the presence of tumor cells in the blood, and elevated cyclooxygenase-2.[31]
 Expression of various mRNAs can also be prognostic for ovarian cancer. High levels of Drosha and Dicer are associated with improved survival, whereas high levels of let-7b, HIF1A, EphA1, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase are associated with worse survival. Cancers that are positive for WT1 carry a worse prognosis; estrogen-receptor positive cancers have a better prognosis.[31]
 Overall five-year survival rates for all types of ovarian cancer are presented below by stage and histologic grade:[26]
 The survival rates given below are for the different types of ovarian cancer, according to American Cancer Society.[129] They come from the National Cancer Institute, SEER, and are based on patients diagnosed from 2004 to 2010.
 Ovarian cancer frequently recurs after treatment. Overall, in a 5-year period, 20% of stage I and II cancers recur. Most recurrences are in the abdomen.[29] If a recurrence occurs in advanced disease, it typically occurs within 18 months of initial treatment (18 months progression-free survival). Recurrences can be treated, but the disease-free interval tends to shorten and chemoresistance increases with each recurrence.[28] When a dysgerminoma recurs, it is most likely to recur within a year of diagnosis, and other malignant germ cell tumors recur within 2 years 90% of the time. Germ cell tumors other than dysgerminomas have a poor prognosis when they relapse, with a 10% long-term survival rate.[32] Low malignant potential tumors rarely relapse, even when fertility-sparing surgery is the treatment of choice. 15% of LMP tumors relapse after unilateral surgery in the previously unaffected ovary, and they are typically easily treated with surgery. More advanced tumors may take up to 20 years to relapse, if they relapse at all, and are only treated with surgery unless the tumor has changed its histological characteristics or grown very quickly. In these cases, and when there is significant ascites, chemotherapy may also be used. Relapse is usually indicated by rising CA-125 levels and then progresses to symptomatic relapse within 2–6 months.[29] Recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors are typically unresponsive to treatment but not aggressive.[32]
 It is the most deadly gynecologic cancer.[29]
 Globally, in 2018, the incidence of ovarian cancer was 6.6 per 100,000 and mortality was 3.9.[135] Globally, about 160,000 people died from ovarian cancer in 2010. This was an increase from 113,000 in 1990.[136] The number of new cases per year in Europe is approximately 5–15 per 100,000 women.[31] In Europe, Lithuania, Latvia, Ireland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic have the highest incidences of ovarian cancer, whereas Portugal and Cyprus have the lowest incidences.[31] In 2008, the five-year survival rate was 44%. This has increased since 1977 when the survival rate was 36%.[126]
 In 2022, in the United States, an estimated 19,880 new cases were diagnosed and 12,810 women died of ovarian cancer.[138] The 5-year relative survival rate is 49.7%.[139] Around 57% cases have metastasized at the time of diagnosis.[139]
 In 2014, over 220,000 diagnoses of epithelial ovarian cancer were made yearly.[28] The overall lifetime risk in the US is around 1.6%[26][31] In the US, ovarian cancer affects 1.3–1.4% and is the cause of death of about 1% of women.[29][140] In the United States, it is also the fifth-most common cancer in women but the fourth-most common cause of cancer death.[31] This decrease made it the ninth-most common cancer in women.[29]
 The risks from developing specific types of ovarian cancer varies. Germ cell tumors and sex cord-stromal tumors are less common than epithelial tumors. The number of new cases a year in the US is 0.4 per 100,000 women and 0.2 per 100,000 women, respectively. In young people, sex-cord stromal tumors and germ cell tumors total 1% of overall ovarian cancer.[32] Ovarian cancer represents approximately 4% of cancers diagnosed in women.[31]
 It is the 5th-most common cancer in UK women (around 7,100 were diagnosed in 2011) and the 5th-most common cause of cancer death in women (around 4,300 died in 2012).[141][31][34] The incidence rate over the whole UK population is 21.6 per 100,000.
 As of 2014, the UK saw approximately 7,000–7,100 yearly diagnoses with 4,200 deaths.[28][34] A 2022 article from The Times put the estimate at 7,500 new cases yearly in Britain.[142] Early symptoms are often mistaken for common conditions such as cystitis or irritable bowel syndrome, and about 40 per cent of UK women wrongly believe that cervical screening detects ovarian cancer, an increase from 30 per cent in 2016.[142] Ashkenazi Jewish women carry mutated BRCA alleles five times more often than the rest of the population, giving them a higher risk developing ovarian cancer.[28]
 Black women have twice the risk for sex cord-stromal tumors compared to non-Black women.[32] The highest prevalence is in Caucasian and Hispanic women, followed by African-American and Asian women.[135] The highest mortality from ovarian cancer is in African-American women.[135]
 In the US, the incidence rate in women over 50 is approximately 33 per 100,000.[143] The rate of ovarian cancer between 1993 and 2008 decreased in women of the 40–49 age cohort and in the 50–64 age cohort.[28] Ovarian cancer is most commonly diagnosed after menopause,[34] between the ages of 60 and 64. Ninety percent of ovarian cancer occurs in women over the age of 45 and 80% in women over 50.[31] Older women are more likely to present with advanced ovarian cancer.[20]
 Malignant germ cell tumors are the type of ovarian cancer most likely to occur during pregnancy. They are typically diagnosed when an adnexal mass is found on examination (in 1–2% of all pregnancies), a tumor is seen on ultrasound, or the parent's level of alpha-fetoprotein is elevated. Dermoid cysts and dysgerminomas are the most common germ cell tumors during pregnancy. Germ cell tumors diagnosed during pregnancy are unlikely to have metastasized and can be treated by surgery and, in some cases, chemotherapy, which carries the risk of birth defects. Yolk sac tumors and immature teratomas grow particularly quickly and are usually treated with chemotherapy even during pregnancy; however, dysgerminomas that have been optimally debulked may be treated after childbirth.[32]
 Ovarian tumors have been reported in equine mares. Reported tumor types include teratoma,[144][145] cystadenocarcinoma,[146] and particularly granulosa cell tumor.[147][148][149][150][151][excessive citations]
 Screening by hysteroscopy to obtain cell samples obtained for histological examination is being developed. This is similar to the current pap smear that is used to detect cervical cancer.[152] The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening is testing a screening technique that combines CA-125 blood tests with transvaginal ultrasound.[28] Other studies suggest that this screening procedure may be effective.[119] Although results published in 2015 were not conclusive, there was some evidence that screening may save lives in the long-term.[153] As a result, the trial has been extended and will publish definitive results at the end of 2019. One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery.[28] The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population.[29] Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.[119]
 Research into various prognostic factors for ovarian cancer is also going on. Recent research shows that thrombocytosis predicts lower survival and higher stage cancer.[28] Ongoing research is also investigating the benefits of surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer.[119]
 While an active area of research, as of 2018 there is no good evidence that immunotherapy is effective for ovarian cancer.[154] However, trials of the antibody and VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab, which can slow the growth of new blood vessels in the cancer, have shown promising results, especially in combination with pazopanib, which also slows the process of blood vessel growth. Bevacizumab has been particularly effective in preliminary studies on stage-III and -IV cancer[28] and has been cited as having at least a 15% response rate.[26] It is being investigated particularly in mucinous ovarian cancers.[119]
 mTOR inhibitors were a highly investigated potential treatment in the 2000s and 2010s, but the side effects of these drugs (particularly hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia) were not well tolerated and the survival benefit not confirmed. PI3 kinase inhibitors have been of interest, but they tend to be highly toxic and cause diarrhea. Another investigated drug is selumetinib, a MAPK inhibitor. It improved survival, but did not correlate with any mutations found in tumors.[28]
 Bevacizumab can also be combined with platinum chemotherapy, a combination that has had positive preliminary results in PFS, but equivocal results regarding overall survival. One disadvantage to these treatments is the side effect profile, which includes high blood pressure and proteinuria. The drug can also exacerbate bowel disease, leading to fistulae or bowel perforation. Vintafolide, which consists of an antifolate conjugated with vinblastine, is also in clinical trials; it may prove beneficial because folate receptors are overexpressed in many ovarian cancers.[28] Another potential immunotherapy is trastuzumab, which is active against tumors positive for Her2/neu mutations.[26] Other angiogenesis inhibitors are also being investigated as potential ovarian cancer treatments. Combretastatin and pazopanib are being researched in combination for recurrent ovarian cancer. Trebananib and tasquinimod are other angiogenesis inhibitors being investigated. The monoclonal antibody farletuzumab is being researched as an adjuvant to traditional chemotherapy. Another type of immunotherapy involves vaccines, including TroVax.[119]
 An alternative to BEP chemotherapy, a regimen of 3 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide, is a current topic of research for germ cell malignancies.[32]
 Intraperitoneal chemotherapy has also been under investigation during the 2000s and 2010s for its potential to deliver higher doses of cytotoxic agent to tumors. Preliminary trials with cisplatin and paclitaxel have shown it is not well tolerated, but does improve survival, and more tolerable regimens are being researched.[28] Cisplatin and paclitaxel are both being researched as intraperitoneal chemotherapy agents. A specific chemotherapy regimen for rare clear-cell cancers is also under investigation: irinotecan combined with cisplatin.[119]
 PARP inhibitors have also shown promise in early trials, particularly in people with BRCA gene mutations, since the BRCA protein interacts with the PARP pathway. It is also being studied in recurrent ovarian cancer in general, where preliminary studies have shown longer PFS. Specifically, olaparib has shown greater survival compared to doxorubicin, though this treatment is still being investigated. It is not clear yet which biomarkers are predictive of responsiveness to PARP inhibitors.[28] Rucaparib is another PARP inhibitor being researched in BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative recurrent advanced ovarian cancer. Niraparib is a PARP inhibitor being tested in BRCA-positive recurrent ovarian cancer.[119]
 Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are another investigational drug class that may have applications in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor group, including pazopanib, cediranib, and nintedanib, have also been shown to increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015.[28] Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3–4 months and increased survival by 3 months.[119] MK-1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. Nintedanib is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.[119]
 Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are another area of research.
 Hormone therapies are a topic of current research in ovarian cancer, particularly, the value of certain medications used to treat breast cancer. These include tamoxifen, letrozole, and anastrozole. Preliminary studies have showed a benefit for tamoxifen in a small number of people with advanced ovarian cancer. Letrozole may help to slow or stop growth of estrogen receptor positive ovarian cancer. Anastrozole is being investigated in postmenopausal people with estrogen receptor-positive cancer.[119]
 Research into mitigating side effects of ovarian cancer treatment is also ongoing. Radiation fibrosis, the formation of scar tissue in an area treated with radiation, may be relieved with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but research has not been completed in this area. Treatment of ovarian cancer may also cause people to experience psychiatric difficulties, including depression. Research is ongoing to determine how counseling and psychotherapy can help people who have ovarian cancer during treatment.[119]
 There are some indications that pelvic inflammatory disease may be associated with ovarian cancer, especially in non-western countries. It may be due to the inflammatory process present with pelvic inflammatory disease.[155]
 Clinical trials are monitored and funded by US governmental organizations to test treatment options to see if they are safe and effective. These include NIH Clinical Research Trials and You (National Institutes of Health),[156] Learn About Clinical Trials (National Cancer Institute),[157] Search for Clinical Trials (National Cancer Institute),[158] ClinicalTrials.gov (National Institutes of Health).[159][93] Clinical trials are also conducted in Canada.[160]

"Pancreatic cancer affects your pancreas, a gland in your abdomen that aids in digestion. Pancreatic cancer symptoms include nausea, bloating, fatigue, jaundice and lack of appetite. Treatments include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Pancreatic cancer survival rates are low because the disease is difficult to detect in the early stages. Pancreatic cancer occurs when cells in your pancreas mutate (change) and multiply out of control, forming a tumor. Your pancreas is a gland in your abdomen (belly), between your spine and stomach. It makes hormones that control blood-sugar levels and enzymes that aid in digestion. Most pancreatic cancers start in the ducts of your pancreas. The main pancreatic duct (the duct of Wirsung) connects your pancreas to your common bile duct. Early-stage pancreatic tumors don’t show up on imaging tests. For this reason, many people don’t receive a diagnosis until the cancer has spread (metastasis). Pancreatic cancer is also resistant to many common cancer drugs, making it notoriously difficult to treat. Ongoing research focuses on early detection through genetic testing and new imaging methods. Still, there’s much to learn. There are two main types of pancreatic tumors: Pancreatic cancer is responsible for approximately 3% of all cancers in the United States. It’s the 10th most common cancer in men and people assigned male at birth, and the 8th most common cancer in women and people assigned female at birth. Cases of pancreatic cancer are on the rise. Trends indicate that pancreatic cancer will be the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States by 2030. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Unfortunately, there aren’t any early signs of pancreatic cancer. Symptoms typically emerge once the tumor starts impacting other organs in your digestive system. Pancreatic cancer symptoms may include: Your healthcare provider might suspect pancreatic cancer if you’ve recently developed diabetes or pancreatitis — a painful condition due to inflammation in your pancreas. Symptoms of pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer may be different from traditional pancreatic cancer symptoms, such as jaundice or weight loss. Symptoms can vary, but may include diarrhea and anemia. There are no tell-tale early signs of pancreatic cancer. Some people develop vague symptoms up to one year before they receive a diagnosis. Many people report that their first pancreatic cancer symptoms were back pain or stomach pain. These symptoms can come and go at first, but may get worse after meals or when you lie down. There isn’t a clear answer. We don’t know exactly what causes pancreatic cancer. But experts have identified some risk factors. A risk factor is something that increases your chances of getting a certain disease. Common pancreatic cancer risk factors include: Advertisement Pancreatic cancer tends to spread (metastasize) to nearby blood vessels, lymph nodes, and then to your liver, peritoneum (the lining of your abdominal cavity) and lungs. The majority of pancreatic cancers have already spread beyond the pancreas at the time of diagnosis. It’s difficult to detect pancreatic cancer in the early stages. This is because healthcare providers can’t feel your pancreas during routine exams and it’s difficult to see these tumors on routine imaging tests. If your provider suspects pancreatic cancer, they’ll recommend a combination of pancreas function tests, which may include: Your healthcare provider may need to take one or more of the following imaging tests: A pancreas blood test can detect tumor markers. A tumor marker is a substance that may indicate the presence of cancer. For pancreatic cancer, high levels of carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 — a type of protein released by pancreatic cancer cells — might indicate a tumor. Sometimes, providers use laparoscopy to determine the extent of pancreatic cancer and whether removal is possible. During this procedure, a surgeon creates a few small incisions (cuts) in your abdomen and inserts a long tube with a camera on the end. This allows them to see inside your abdomen and look for abnormalities. Often, they’ll take a biopsy during the same procedure. If you receive a pancreatic cancer diagnosis, you should consider genetic testing. This can tell you if there’s a hereditary reason you developed pancreatic cancer. It can also help your healthcare provider determine which type of treatment will be most effective for you. Some people with pancreatic cancer have mutations in genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Though you may recognize these genes as the “breast cancer genes,” mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 may also indicate other types of cancer, including prostate, ovarian and pancreatic. If you’re a first-degree relative (a parent, child or sibling) of someone who has pancreatic cancer, you should consider genetic testing. Your results can tell you if you have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. Keep in mind, even if you have the mutation, it doesn’t mean you’ll get cancer. But knowing your risk is important. Advertisement Healthcare providers rank pancreatic tumors into four different categories: If you have specific questions about pancreatic cancer staging, talk to your healthcare provider. Understanding your pancreatic cancer diagnosis can help you make an informed decision about your treatment. Even though pancreatic cancer has a poor survival rate, complete remission is possible with early detection and treatment. The only way to realistically cure pancreatic cancer is total surgical removal of the cancer. Specific treatment depends on certain factors, including: Pancreatic cancer treatments include: Surgery is the only realistic way to cure pancreatic cancer. But surgeons only recommend it when they think they can remove all of the cancer. Otherwise, there’s little to no benefit. For surgery to be successful, the cancer must be completely confined to the pancreas. Even then, total cancer removal may not be possible. There are a few different surgical techniques, depending on the location and size of the tumor: If the tumor is in the head of your pancreas (the widest part of your pancreas, near your small intestine), your provider may recommend the Whipple procedure. This surgical approach removes the head of your pancreas, your duodenum (the first portion of your small intestine), your gallbladder, a portion of your bile duct and nearby lymph nodes. Your surgeon will then attach your remaining bile duct and pancreas to your small intestine. This reestablishes your digestive tract. If the tumor is in the tail of your pancreas, a surgeon can perform a distal pancreatectomy. During this procedure, a surgeon removes the tail of your pancreas and some of the pancreas body. In most cases, they’ll also remove your spleen. As your spleen helps fight infections, your healthcare provider may recommend getting certain vaccinations before having a distal pancreatectomy. If cancer has spread throughout your entire pancreas, but resection (removal) is still possible, your healthcare provider may consider a total pancreatectomy. This surgery removes your entire pancreas, gallbladder, spleen and part of your stomach and small intestine. It’s possible to live without a pancreas, but it can cause major side effects. Your pancreas makes insulin and other hormones that keep blood sugar at a safe level. Without a pancreas, you’ll develop diabetes and need insulin shots to survive. Additionally, you’ll need to take pancreatic enzyme pills to help with digestion. Chemotherapy uses drugs that kill cancer cells. Healthcare providers give these drugs in pill form or through an IV in your arm. Providers use chemotherapy as a stand-alone treatment — especially for people with advanced pancreatic cancer. They may also recommend chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor or after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells. Healthcare providers commonly use this approach to treat pancreatic cancer. Most often, providers combine radiation therapy with chemotherapy (chemoradiation). They may recommend it before surgery, after surgery or as part of your main cancer treatment. Radiation therapy can also help ease pancreatic cancer symptoms in people who don’t qualify for surgery (in cases of advanced cancer). This treatment uses drugs that “target” certain proteins. These proteins control how cancer cells grow and spread. Providers may combine targeted therapy with other treatments like radiation therapy. Common targeted therapy drugs for pancreatic cancer include: Pancreatic cancer could be very painful as it may involve nearby nerves. Your healthcare provider can help you manage pain with oral medications, anesthesia or steroid injections. If you have pancreatic cancer and start to develop severe and persistent pain, tell your healthcare provider. They can find a treatment that will ease your symptoms. You can’t prevent pancreatic cancer. But there are things you can do to lower your risk: Healthcare providers don’t usually perform routine screenings for pancreatic cancer. But in people with a high risk of pancreatic cancer due to genetic predisposition, providers recommend monitoring with imaging tests and endoscopic ultrasounds. If you have a first-degree family member (parents or siblings) with pancreatic cancer, you should talk to a healthcare provider about your risk of developing pancreatic cancer and proper screening and genetic tests. A pancreatic cancer diagnosis can feel overwhelming. Because everyone is unique, no two cases are the same. Your healthcare provider will assemble a team of experts to determine the best treatment plan for your situation. Your medical team may include: Generally, it takes about 10 to 20 years for a single cancer cell in your pancreas to turn into a tumor. The goal of ongoing research is to determine how healthcare providers can detect pancreatic cancer in its earliest stages, when it’s more treatable. In the United States, the five-year survival rate for people with pancreatic cancer is 11%. This means that 11 out of 100 people are still alive five years after their diagnosis. Survival rates are only estimates. They can’t tell you how long you’ll live or how well you’ll respond to treatment. If you have specific questions about survival rates and what they mean for you, talk to your healthcare provider. There are no clear-cut symptoms for early-stage pancreatic cancer. However, you should see a healthcare provider right away if you develop: Develop an open and cooperative relationship with your healthcare provider. If you or a loved one received a pancreatic cancer diagnosis, here are some questions you may want to ask: As pancreatic cancer progresses, you may develop new symptoms. Advanced pancreatic cancer symptoms may include: A note from Cleveland Clinic A pancreatic cancer diagnosis can be shocking and life-changing. Your healthcare provider is here to help you navigate this difficult time. You might consider joining a local or online support group for people with pancreatic cancer. Spending time with others who are going through the same things can be empowering and beneficial for your mental and emotional health. You can also talk with a counselor, therapist or social worker about how you’re feeling. Knowledge is power, and there are several helpful resources available for you and your family.

 Pancreatic cancer arises when cells in the pancreas, a glandular organ behind the stomach, begin to multiply out of control and form a mass. These cancerous cells have the ability to invade other parts of the body.[9] A number of types of pancreatic cancer are known.[10]
 The most common, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, accounts for about 90% of cases,[11] and the term ""pancreatic cancer"" is sometimes used to refer only to that type.[10] These adenocarcinomas start within the part of the pancreas that makes digestive enzymes.[10] Several other types of cancer, which collectively represent the majority of the non-adenocarcinomas, can also arise from these cells.[10]
 About 1–2% of cases of pancreatic cancer are neuroendocrine tumors, which arise from the hormone-producing cells of the pancreas.[10] These are generally less aggressive than pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[10]
 Signs and symptoms of the most-common form of pancreatic cancer may include yellow skin, abdominal or back pain, unexplained weight loss, light-colored stools, dark urine, and loss of appetite.[1] Usually, no symptoms are seen in the disease's early stages, and symptoms that are specific enough to suggest pancreatic cancer typically do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage.[1][2] By the time of diagnosis, pancreatic cancer has often spread to other parts of the body.[10][12]
 Pancreatic cancer rarely occurs before the age of 40, and more than half of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma occur in those over 70.[2] Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes, and certain rare genetic conditions.[2] About 25% of cases are linked to smoking,[3] and 5–10% are linked to inherited genes.[2]
 Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed by a combination of medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound or computed tomography, blood tests, and examination of tissue samples (biopsy).[3][4] The disease is divided into stages, from early (stage I) to late (stage IV).[12] Screening the general population has not been found to be effective.[13]
 The risk of developing pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of red or processed meat;[5] the risk is greater for men, smokers, and those with diabetes.[14] There is some evidence that links high levels of red meat consumption to increased risk of pancreatic cancer. [15][16][17] Smokers' risk of developing the disease decreases immediately upon quitting, and almost returns to that of the rest of the population after 20 years.[10] Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these.[1] Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage.[1] Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma,[12] and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure.[1][12] Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed.[12] Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.[18]
 
Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of cancer globally, with one of the lowest survival rates. In 2015, pancreatic cancers of all types resulted in 411,600 deaths globally.[8] Pancreatic cancer is the fifth-most-common cause of death from cancer in the United Kingdom,[19] and the third most-common in the United States.[20] The disease occurs most often in the developed world, where about 70% of the new cases in 2012 originated.[10] Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has a very poor prognosis; after diagnosis, 25% of people survive one year and 12% live for five years.[6][10] For cancers diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate rises to about 20%.[21] Neuroendocrine cancers have better outcomes; at five years from diagnosis, 65% of those diagnosed are living, though survival considerably varies depending on the type of tumor.[10] The many types of pancreatic cancer can be divided into two general groups. The vast majority of cases (about 95%) occur in the part of the pancreas that produces digestive enzymes, known as the exocrine component. Several subtypes of exocrine pancreatic cancers are described, but their diagnosis and treatment have much in common.
 The small minority of cancers that arise in the hormone-producing (endocrine) tissue of the pancreas have different clinical characteristics and are called pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, sometimes abbreviated as ""PanNETs"". Both groups occur mainly (but not exclusively) in people over 40, and are slightly more common in men, but some rare subtypes mainly occur in women or children.[23][24]
 The exocrine group is dominated by pancreatic adenocarcinoma (variations of this name may add ""invasive"" and ""ductal""), which is by far the most common type, representing about 85% of all pancreatic cancers.[2] Nearly all these start in the ducts of the pancreas, as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).[25] This is despite the fact that the tissue from which it arises – the pancreatic ductal epithelium – represents less than 10% of the pancreas by cell volume, because it constitutes only the ducts (an extensive but capillary-like duct-system fanning out) within the pancreas.[26]  This cancer originates in the ducts that carry secretions (such as enzymes and bicarbonate) away from the pancreas. About 60–70% of adenocarcinomas occur in the head of the pancreas.[2]
 The next-most common type, acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas, arises in the clusters of cells that produce these enzymes, and represents 5% of exocrine pancreas cancers.[27] Like the 'functioning' endocrine cancers described below, acinar cell carcinomas may cause over-production of certain molecules, in this case digestive enzymes, which may cause symptoms such as skin rashes and joint pain.
 Cystadenocarcinomas account for 1% of pancreatic cancers, and they have a better prognosis than the other exocrine types.[27]
 Pancreatoblastoma is a rare form, mostly occurring in childhood, and with a relatively good prognosis.  Other exocrine cancers include adenosquamous carcinomas, signet ring cell carcinomas, hepatoid carcinomas, colloid carcinomas, undifferentiated carcinomas, and undifferentiated carcinomas with osteoclast-like giant cells. Solid pseudopapillary tumor is a rare low-grade neoplasm that mainly affects younger women, and generally has a very good prognosis.[2][28]
 Pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasms are a broad group of pancreas tumors that have varying malignant potential. They are being detected at a greatly increased rate as CT scans become more powerful and common, and discussion continues as how best to assess and treat them, given that many are benign.[29]
 The small minority of tumors that arise elsewhere in the pancreas are mainly pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs).[30] Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a diverse group of benign or malignant tumors that arise from the body's neuroendocrine cells, which are responsible for integrating the nervous and endocrine systems. NETs can start in most organs of the body, including the pancreas, where the various malignant types are all considered to be rare.  PanNETs are grouped into 'functioning' and 'nonfunctioning' types, depending on the degree to which they produce hormones. The functioning types secrete hormones such as insulin, gastrin, and glucagon into the bloodstream, often in large quantities, giving rise to serious symptoms such as low blood sugar, but also favoring relatively early detection. The most common functioning PanNETs are insulinomas and gastrinomas, named after the hormones they secrete. The nonfunctioning types do not secrete hormones in a sufficient quantity to give rise to overt clinical symptoms, so nonfunctioning PanNETs are often diagnosed only after the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.[31]
 As with other neuroendocrine tumors, the history of the terminology and classification of PanNETs is complex.[30] PanNETs are sometimes called ""islet cell cancers"",[32]  though they are now known to not actually arise from islet cells as previously thought.[31]
 Since pancreatic cancer usually does not cause recognizable symptoms in its early stages, the disease is typically not diagnosed until it has spread beyond the pancreas itself.[4]  This is one of the main reasons for the generally poor survival rates. Exceptions to this are the functioning PanNETs, where over-production of various active hormones can give rise to symptoms (which depend on the type of hormone).[33]
 Common presenting symptoms of pancreatic adenocarcinoma include:
 Other common manifestations of the disease include weakness and tiring easily, dry mouth, sleep problems, and a palpable abdominal mass.[35]
 The spread of pancreatic cancer to other organs (metastasis) may also cause symptoms. Typically, pancreatic adenocarcinoma first spreads to nearby lymph nodes, and later to the liver or to the peritoneal cavity, large intestine, or lungs.[3] Uncommonly, it spreads to the bones or brain.[37]
 Cancers in the pancreas may also be secondary cancers that have spread from other parts of the body.  This is uncommon, found in only about 2% of cases of pancreatic cancer. Kidney cancer is by far the most common cancer to spread to the pancreas, followed by colorectal cancer, and then cancers of the skin, breast, and lung.  Surgery may be performed on the pancreas in such cases, whether in hope of a cure or to alleviate symptoms.[38]
 Risk factors for pancreatic adenocarcinoma include:[2][10][12][39][40][excessive citations]
 Drinking alcohol excessively is a major cause of chronic pancreatitis, which in turn predisposes to pancreatic cancer, but considerable research has failed to firmly establish alcohol consumption as a direct risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Overall, the association is consistently weak and the majority of studies have found no association, with smoking a strong confounding factor. The evidence is stronger for a link with heavy drinking, of at least six drinks per day.[3][49]
 Exocrine cancers are thought to arise from several types of precancerous lesions within the pancreas, but these lesions do not always progress to cancer, and the increased numbers detected as a byproduct of the increasing use of CT scans for other reasons are not all treated.[3]  Apart from pancreatic serous cystadenomas, which are almost always benign, four types of precancerous lesion are recognized.
 The first is pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). These lesions are microscopic abnormalities in the pancreas and are often found in autopsies of people with no diagnosed cancer. These lesions may progress from low to high grade and then to a tumor. More than 90% of cases at all grades carry a faulty KRAS gene, while in grades 2 and 3, damage to three further genes – CDKN2A (p16), p53, and SMAD4 – are increasingly often found.[2]
 A second type is the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). These are macroscopic lesions, which are found in about 2% of all adults. This rate rises to about 10% by age 70. These lesions have about a 25% risk of developing into invasive cancer. They may have KRAS gene mutations (40–65% of cases) and in the GNAS Gs alpha subunit and RNF43, affecting the Wnt signaling pathway.[2] Even if removed surgically,  a considerably increased risk remains of pancreatic cancer developing subsequently.[3]
 The third type, pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN), mainly occurs in women, and may remain benign or progress to cancer.[51] If these lesions become large, cause symptoms, or have suspicious features, they can usually be successfully removed by surgery.[3]
 A fourth type of cancer that arises in the pancreas is the intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm. This type was recognised by the WHO in 2010 and constitutes about 1–3% of all pancreatic neoplasms.  Mean age at diagnosis is 61 years (range 35–78 years). About 50% of these lesions become invasive. Diagnosis depends on histology, as these lesions are very difficult to differentiate from other lesions on either clinical or radiological grounds.[52]
 The genetic events found in ductal adenocarcinoma have been well characterized, and complete exome sequencing has been done for the common types of tumor. Four genes have each been found to be mutated in the majority of adenocarcinomas: KRAS (in 95% of cases), CDKN2A (also in 95%), TP53 (75%), and SMAD4 (55%).  The last of these is especially associated with a poor prognosis.[3] SWI/SNF mutations/deletions occur in about 10–15% of the adenocarcinomas.[2]  The genetic alterations in several other types of pancreatic cancer and precancerous lesions have also been researched.[3] Transcriptomics analyses and mRNA sequencing for the common forms of pancreatic cancer have found that 75% of human genes are expressed in the tumors, with some 200 genes more specifically expressed in pancreatic cancer as compared to other tumor types.[53][54]
 The genes often found mutated in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) are different from those in exocrine pancreatic cancer.[55] For example, KRAS mutation is normally absent. Instead, hereditary MEN1 gene mutations give risk to MEN1 syndrome, in which primary tumors occur in two or more endocrine glands. About 40–70% of people born with a MEN1 mutation eventually develop a PanNet.[56] Other genes that are frequently mutated include DAXX, mTOR, and ATRX.[31]
 The symptoms of pancreatic adenocarcinoma do not usually appear in the disease's early stages, and they are not individually distinctive to the disease.[3][12][34]  The symptoms at diagnosis vary according to the location of the cancer in the pancreas, which anatomists divide (from left to right on most diagrams) into the thick head, the neck, and the tapering body, ending in the tail.
 Regardless of a tumor's location, the most common symptom is unexplained weight loss, which may be considerable. A large minority (between 35% and 47%) of people diagnosed with the disease will have had nausea, vomiting, or a feeling of weakness.  Tumors in the head of the pancreas typically also cause jaundice, pain, loss of appetite, dark urine, and light-colored stools. Tumors in the body and tail typically also cause pain.[34]
 People sometimes have recent onset of atypical type 2 diabetes that is difficult to control, a history of recent but unexplained blood vessel inflammation caused by blood clots (thrombophlebitis) known as Trousseau sign, or a previous attack of pancreatitis.[34] A doctor may suspect pancreatic cancer when the onset of diabetes in someone over 50 years old is accompanied by typical symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, persistent abdominal or back pain, indigestion, vomiting, or fatty feces.[12] Jaundice accompanied by a painlessly swollen gallbladder (known as Courvoisier's sign) may also raise suspicion, and can help differentiate pancreatic cancer from gallstones.[57]
 Medical imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT scan) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are used both to confirm the diagnosis and to help decide whether the tumor can be surgically removed (its ""resectability"").[12] On contrast CT scan, pancreatic cancer typically shows a gradually increasing radiocontrast uptake, rather than a fast washout as seen in a normal pancreas or a delayed washout as seen in chronic pancreatitis.[58] Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography may also be used,[2] and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography may be useful in some cases.[34] Abdominal ultrasound is less sensitive and will miss small tumors, but can identify cancers that have spread to the liver and build-up of fluid in the peritoneal cavity (ascites).[12]  It may be used for a quick and cheap first examination before other techniques.[59]
 A biopsy by fine needle aspiration, often guided by endoscopic ultrasound, may be used where there is uncertainty over the diagnosis, but a histologic diagnosis is not usually required for removal of the tumor by surgery to go ahead.[12]
 Liver function tests can show a combination of results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised conjugated bilirubin, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels). CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.[2][12]
 The most common form of pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma) is typically characterized by moderately to poorly differentiated glandular structures on microscopic examination. There is typically considerable desmoplasia or formation of a dense fibrous stroma or structural tissue consisting of a range of cell types (including myofibroblasts, macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells) and deposited material (such as type I collagen and hyaluronic acid).  This creates a tumor microenvironment that is short of blood vessels (hypovascular) and so of oxygen (tumor hypoxia).[2]  It is thought that this prevents many chemotherapy drugs from reaching the tumor, as one factor making the cancer especially hard to treat.[2][3]
 Negative for:
 Pancreatic cancer is usually staged following a CT scan.[34]  The most widely used cancer staging system for pancreatic cancer is the one formulated by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) together with the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). The AJCC-UICC staging system designates four main overall stages, ranging from early to advanced disease, based on TNM classification of Tumor size, spread to lymph Nodes, and Metastasis.[64]
 To help decide treatment, the tumors are also divided into three broader categories based on whether surgical removal seems possible: in this way, tumors are judged to be ""resectable"", ""borderline resectable"", or ""unresectable"".[65] When the disease is still in an early stage (AJCC-UICC stages I and II), without spread to large blood vessels or distant organs such as the liver or lungs, surgical resection of the tumor can normally be performed, if the patient is willing to undergo this major operation and is thought to be sufficiently fit.[12]
 The AJCC-UICC staging system allows distinction between stage III tumors that are judged to be ""borderline resectable"" (where surgery is technically feasible because the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery are still free) and those that are ""unresectable"" (due to more locally advanced disease); in terms of the more detailed TNM classification, these two groups correspond to T3 and T4 respectively.[3]
 Locally advanced adenocarcinomas have spread into neighboring organs, which may be any of the following (in roughly decreasing order of frequency): the duodenum, stomach, transverse colon, spleen, adrenal gland, or kidney. Very often they also spread to the important blood or lymphatic vessels and nerves that run close to the pancreas, making surgery far more difficult. Typical sites for metastatic spread (stage IV disease) are the liver, peritoneal cavity and lungs, all  of which occur in 50% or more of fully advanced cases.[66]
 The 2010 WHO classification of tumors of the digestive system grades all the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) into three categories, based on their degree of cellular differentiation (from ""NET G1"" through to the poorly differentiated ""NET G3"").[24] The U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends use of the same AJCC-UICC staging system as pancreatic adenocarcinoma.[67]: 52  Using this scheme, the stage-by-stage outcomes for PanNETs are dissimilar to those of the exocrine cancers.[68] A different TNM system for PanNETs has been proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society.[24]
 Apart from not smoking, the American Cancer Society recommends keeping a healthy weight, and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while decreasing consumption of red and processed meat, although there is no consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically.[69] A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of citrus fruits and curcumin reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.[49]
 In the general population, screening of large groups is not considered effective and may be harmful as of 2019,[70] although newer techniques, and the screening of tightly targeted groups, are being evaluated.[71][72] Nevertheless, regular screening with endoscopic ultrasound and MRI/CT imaging is recommended for those at high risk from inherited genetics.[4][59][72][73]
 A 2019 meta-analysis found that use of aspirin might be negatively associated with the incidence risk of pancreatic cancer, but found no significant relationship with pancreatic cancer mortality.[74]
 A key assessment that is made after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as this is the only cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.[3]
 Chemotherapy and, to a lesser extent, radiotherapy are likely to be offered to most people, whether or not surgery is possible. Specialists advise that the management of pancreatic cancer should be in the hands of a multidisciplinary team including specialists in several aspects of oncology, and is, therefore, best conducted in larger centers.[2][3]
 Surgery with the intention of a cure is only possible in around one-fifth (20%) of new cases.[12]  Although CT scans help, in practice it can be difficult to determine whether the tumor can be fully removed (its ""resectability""), and it may only become apparent during surgery that it is not possible to successfully remove the tumor without damaging other vital tissues. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on various factors, including the precise extent of local anatomical adjacency to, or involvement of, the venous or arterial blood vessels,[2] as well as surgical expertise and a careful consideration of projected post-operative recovery.[75][76] The age of the person is not in itself a reason not to operate, but their general performance status needs to be adequate for a major operation.[12]
 One particular feature that is evaluated is the encouraging presence, or discouraging absence, of a clear layer or plane of fat creating a barrier between the tumor and the vessels.[3]  Traditionally, an assessment is made of the tumor's proximity to major venous or arterial vessels, in terms of ""abutment"" (defined as the tumor touching no more than half a blood vessel's circumference without any fat to separate it), ""encasement"" (when the tumor encloses most of the vessel's circumference), or full vessel involvement.[77]: 22  A resection that includes encased sections of blood vessels may be possible in some cases,[78][79] particularly if preliminary neoadjuvant therapy is feasible,[80][81][82] using chemotherapy[76][77]: 36 [83] and/or radiotherapy.[77]: 29–30 
 Even when the operation appears to have been successful, cancerous cells are often found around the edges (""margins"") of the removed tissue,  when a pathologist examines them microscopically (this will always be done), indicating the cancer has not been entirely removed.[2] Furthermore, cancer stem cells are usually not evident microscopically, and if they are present they may continue to develop and spread.[84][85] An exploratory laparoscopy (a small, camera-guided surgical procedure) may therefore be performed to gain a clearer idea of the outcome of a full operation.[86]
 For cancers involving the head of the pancreas, the Whipple procedure is the most commonly attempted curative surgical treatment. This is a major operation which involves removing the pancreatic head and the curve of the duodenum together (""pancreato-duodenectomy""), making a bypass for food from the stomach to the jejunum (""gastro-jejunostomy"") and attaching a loop of jejunum to the cystic duct to drain bile (""cholecysto-jejunostomy""). It can be performed only if the person is likely to survive major surgery and if the cancer is localized without invading local structures or metastasizing. It can, therefore, be performed only in a minority of cases.  Cancers of the tail of the pancreas can be resected using a procedure known as a distal pancreatectomy, which often also entails removal of the spleen.[2][3] Nowadays, this can often be done using minimally invasive surgery.[2][3]
 Although curative surgery no longer entails the very high death rates that occurred until the 1980s, a high proportion of people (about 30–45%) still have to be treated for a post-operative sickness that is not caused by the cancer itself.  The most common complication of surgery is difficulty in emptying the stomach.[3]  Certain more limited surgical procedures may also be used to ease symptoms (see Palliative care): for instance, if the cancer is invading or compressing the duodenum or colon. In such cases, bypass surgery might overcome the obstruction and improve quality of life but is not intended as a cure.[12]
 After surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine or 5-FU can be offered if the person is sufficiently fit, after a recovery period of one to two months.[4][59]  In people not suitable for curative surgery, chemotherapy may be used to extend life or improve its quality.[3] Before surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy  may be used in cases that are considered to be ""borderline resectable"" (see Staging) in order to reduce the cancer to a level where surgery could be beneficial. In other cases neoadjuvant therapy remains controversial, because it delays surgery.[3][4][87]
 Gemcitabine was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997, after a clinical trial reported improvements in quality of life and a five-week improvement in median survival duration in people with advanced pancreatic cancer.[88] This was the first chemotherapy drug approved by the FDA primarily for a nonsurvival clinical trial endpoint.[89]  Chemotherapy using gemcitabine alone was the standard for about a decade, as a number of trials testing it in combination with other drugs failed to demonstrate significantly better outcomes. However, the combination of gemcitabine with erlotinib was found to increase survival modestly, and erlotinib was licensed by the FDA for use in pancreatic cancer in 2005.[90]
 The FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy regimen using four drugs was found more effective than gemcitabine, but with substantial side effects, and is thus only suitable for people with good performance status.  This is also true of protein-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel), which was licensed by the FDA in 2013 for use with gemcitabine in pancreas cancer.[91] By the end of 2013, both FOLFIRINOX and nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine were regarded as good choices for those able to tolerate the side-effects, and gemcitabine remained an effective option for those who were not.  A head-to-head trial between the two new options is awaited, and trials investigating other variations continue.  However, the changes of the last few years have only increased survival times by a few months.[88]  Clinical trials are often conducted for novel adjuvant therapies.[4]
 The role of radiotherapy as an auxiliary (adjuvant) treatment after potentially curative surgery has been controversial since the 1980s.[3] In the early 2000s the European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer Research (ESPAC) showed prognostic superiority of adjuvant chemotherapy over chemoradiotherapy.[92][93][4] The European Society for Medical Oncology recommends that adjuvant radiotherapy should only be used for people enrolled in clinical trials.[59]  However, there is a continuing tendency for clinicians in the US to be more ready to use adjuvant radiotherapy than those in Europe.  Many clinical trials have tested a variety of treatment combinations since the 1980s, but have failed to settle the matter conclusively.[3][4]
 Radiotherapy may form part of treatment to attempt to shrink a tumor to a resectable state, but its use on unresectable tumors remains controversial as there are conflicting results from clinical trials.  The preliminary results of one trial, presented in 2013, ""markedly reduced enthusiasm"" for its use on locally advanced tumors.[2]
 Treatment of PanNETs, including the less common malignant types, may include a number of approaches.[67][94][95][96]  Some small tumors of less than 1 cm. that are identified incidentally, for example on a CT scan performed for other purposes, may be followed by watchful waiting.[67] This depends on the assessed risk of surgery which is influenced by the site of the tumor and the presence of other medical problems.[67] Tumors within the pancreas only (localized tumors), or with limited metastases, for example to the liver, may be removed by surgery.  The type of surgery depends on the tumor location, and the degree of spread to lymph nodes.[24]
 For localized tumors, the surgical procedure may be much less extensive than the types of surgery used to treat pancreatic adenocarcinoma described above, but otherwise surgical procedures are similar to those for exocrine tumors.  The range of possible outcomes varies greatly; some types have a very high survival rate after surgery while others have a poor outlook.  As all this group are rare, guidelines emphasize that treatment should be undertaken in a specialized center.[24][31] Use of liver transplantation may be considered in certain cases of liver metastasis.[97]
 For functioning tumors, the somatostatin analog class of medications, such as octreotide, can reduce the excessive production of hormones.[24] Lanreotide can slow tumor growth.[98] If the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and is causing symptoms, targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib can reduce symptoms and slow progression of the disease.[31][99][100] Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally not very effective for PanNETs, but may be used when other drug treatments fail to prevent the disease from progressing,[31] or in poorly differentiated PanNET cancers.[101]
 Radiation therapy is occasionally used if there is pain due to anatomic extension, such as metastasis to bone.  Some PanNETs absorb specific peptides or hormones, and these PanNETs may respond to nuclear medicine therapy with radiolabeled peptides or hormones such as iobenguane (iodine-131-MIBG).[102][103][104][105] Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, and hepatic artery embolization may also be used.[106][107]
 Palliative care is medical care which focuses on treatment of symptoms from serious illness, such as cancer, and improving quality of life.[108]  Because pancreatic adenocarcinoma is usually diagnosed after it has progressed to an advanced stage, palliative care as a treatment of symptoms is often the only treatment possible.[109]
 Palliative care focuses not on treating the underlying cancer, but on treating symptoms such as pain or nausea, and can assist in decision-making, including when or if hospice care will be beneficial.[110]  Pain can be managed with medications such as opioids or through procedural intervention, by a nerve block on the celiac plexus (CPB).  This alters or, depending on the technique used, destroys the nerves that transmit pain from the abdomen.  CPB is a safe and effective way to reduce the pain, which generally reduces the need to use opioid painkillers, which have significant negative side effects.[3][111]
 Other symptoms or complications that can be treated with palliative surgery are obstruction by the tumor of the intestines or bile ducts.  For the latter, which occurs in well over half of cases, a small metal tube called a stent may be inserted by endoscope to keep the ducts draining.[34]  Palliative care can also help treat depression that often comes with the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.[3]
 Both surgery and advanced inoperable tumors often lead to digestive system disorders from a lack of the exocrine products of the pancreas (exocrine insufficiency).  These can be treated by taking pancreatin which contains manufactured pancreatic enzymes, and is best taken with food.[12]  Difficulty in emptying the stomach (delayed gastric emptying) is common and can be a serious problem, involving hospitalization. Treatment may involve a variety of approaches, including draining the stomach by nasogastric aspiration and drugs called proton-pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists, which both reduce production of gastric acid.[12] Medications like metoclopramide can also be used to clear stomach contents.
 Pancreatic adenocarcinoma and the other less common exocrine cancers have a very poor prognosis, as they are normally diagnosed at a late stage when the cancer is already locally advanced or has spread to other parts of the body.[2] Outcomes are much better for PanNETs: Many are benign and completely without clinical symptoms, and even those cases not treatable with surgery have an average five-year survival rate of 16%,[65] although the outlook varies considerably according to the type.[33]
 For locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% of cases, numerous trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, but not to more than one year.[2][88] Overall five-year survival for pancreatic cancer in the US has improved from 2% in cases diagnosed in 1975–1977, and 4% in 1987–1989 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–2009.[112] In the less than 20% of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a diagnosis of a localized and small cancerous growth (less than 2 cm in Stage T1), about 20% of Americans survive to five years.[21]
 About 1500 genes are linked to outcomes in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These include both unfavorable genes, where high expression is related to poor outcome, for example C-Met and MUC-1, and favorable genes where high expression is associated with better survival, for example the transcription factor PELP1.[53][54]
 In 2015, pancreatic cancers of all types resulted in 411,600 deaths globally.[8] In 2014, an estimated 46,000 people in the US are expected to be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 40,000 to die of it.[2]  Although it accounts for only 2.5% of new cases, pancreatic cancer is responsible for 6% of cancer deaths each year.[113] It is the seventh-highest cause of death from cancer worldwide.[10] Pancreatic cancer is the fifth most-common cause of death from cancer in the United Kingdom,[19] and the third most-common in the United States.[20]
 Globally, pancreatic cancer is the 11th most-common cancer in women and the 12th most-common in men.[10] The majority of recorded cases occur in developed countries.[10] People from the United States have an average lifetime risk of about 1 in 67 (or 1.5%) of developing the disease,[114] slightly higher than the figure for the UK.[115] The disease is more common in men than women,[2][10] although the difference in rates has narrowed over recent decades, probably reflecting earlier increases in female smoking. In the United States, the risk for African Americans is over 50% greater than for whites, but the rates in Africa and East Asia are much lower than those in North America or Europe. The United States, Central, and eastern Europe, and Argentina and Uruguay all have high rates.[10]
 The annual incidence of clinically recognized pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) is low (about 5 per one million person-years) and is dominated by the non-functioning types.[28] Somewhere between 45% and 90% of PanNETs are thought to be of the non-functioning types.[24][31] Studies of autopsies have uncovered small PanNETs rather frequently, suggesting that the prevalence of tumors that remain inert and asymptomatic may be relatively high.[31] Overall PanNETs are thought to account for about 1 to 2% of all pancreatic tumors.[28] The definition and classification of PanNETs has changed over time, affecting what is known about their epidemiology and clinical relevance.[55]
 The earliest recognition of pancreatic cancer has been attributed to the 18th-century Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Morgagni, the historical father of modern-day anatomic pathology, who claimed to have traced several cases of cancer in the pancreas. Many 18th and 19th-century physicians were skeptical about the existence of the disease, given the similar appearance of pancreatitis. Some case reports were published in the 1820s and 1830s, and a genuine histopathologic diagnosis was eventually recorded by the American clinician Jacob Mendes Da Costa, who also doubted the reliability of Morgagni's interpretations. By the start of the 20th century, cancer of the head of the pancreas had become a well-established diagnosis.[116]
 Regarding the recognition of PanNETs, the possibility of cancer of the islet cells was initially suggested in 1888. The first case of hyperinsulinism due to a tumor of this type was reported in 1927. Recognition of a non-insulin-secreting type of PanNET is generally ascribed to the American surgeons, R. M. Zollinger and E. H. Ellison, who gave their names to Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, after postulating the existence of a gastrin-secreting pancreatic tumor in a report of two cases of unusually severe peptic ulcers published in 1955.[116] In 2010, the WHO recommended that PanNETs be referred to as ""neuroendocrine"" rather than ""endocrine"" tumors.[30]
 Small precancerous neoplasms for many pancreatic cancers are being detected at greatly increased rates by modern medical imaging. One type, the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) was first described by Japanese researchers in 1982. It was noted in 2010 that: ""For the next decade, little attention was paid to this report; however, over the subsequent 15 years, there has been a virtual explosion in the recognition of this tumor.""[66]
 The first reported partial pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed by the Italian surgeon Alessandro Codivilla in 1898, but the patient only survived 18 days before succumbing to complications. Early operations were compromised partly because of mistaken beliefs that people would die if their duodenum were removed, and also, at first, if the flow of pancreatic juices stopped. Later it was thought, also mistakenly, that the pancreatic duct could simply be tied up without serious adverse effects; in fact, it will very often leak later on. In 1907–1908, after some more unsuccessful operations by other surgeons, experimental procedures were tried on corpses by French surgeons.[117]
 In 1912 the German surgeon Walther Kausch was the first to remove large parts of the duodenum and pancreas together (en bloc). This was in Breslau, now Wrocław, in Poland. In 1918 it was demonstrated, in operations on dogs, that it is possible to survive even after complete removal of the duodenum, but no such result was reported in human surgery until 1935, when the American surgeon Allen Oldfather Whipple published the results of a series of three operations at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York. Only one of the patients had the duodenum entirely removed, but he survived for two years before dying of metastasis to the liver.
 The first operation was unplanned, as cancer was only discovered in the operating theater. Whipple's success showed the way for the future, but the operation remained a difficult and dangerous one until recent decades. He published several refinements to his procedure, including the first total removal of the duodenum in 1940, but he only performed a total of 37 operations.[117]
 The discovery in the late 1930s that vitamin K prevented bleeding with jaundice, and the development of blood transfusion as an everyday process, both improved post-operative survival,[117] but about 25% of people never left hospital alive as late as the 1970s.[118] In the 1970s a group of American surgeons wrote urging that the procedure was too dangerous and should be abandoned. Since then outcomes in larger centers have improved considerably, and mortality from the operation is often less than 4%.[26]
 In 2006 a report was published of a series of 1,000 consecutive pancreatico-duodenectomies performed by a single surgeon from Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1969 and 2003. The rate of these operations had increased steadily over this period, with only three of them before 1980, and the median operating time reduced from 8.8 hours in the 1970s to 5.5 hours in the 2000s, and mortality within 30 days or in hospital was only 1%.[117][118] Another series of 2,050 operations at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 1941 and 2011 showed a similar picture of improvement.[119]
 Early-stage research on pancreatic cancer includes studies of genetics and early detection, treatment at different cancer stages, surgical strategies, and targeted therapies, such as inhibition of growth factors, immune therapies, and vaccines.[44][120][121][122][123] Bile acids may have a role in the carcinogenesis of pancreatic cancer.[124]
 A key question is the timing of events as the disease develops and progresses – particularly the role of diabetes,[120][36] and how and when the disease spreads.[125] The knowledge that new onset of diabetes can be an early sign of the disease could facilitate timely diagnosis and prevention if a workable screening strategy can be developed.[120][36][126] The European Registry of Hereditary Pancreatitis and Familial Pancreatic Cancer (EUROPAC) trial is aiming to determine whether regular screening is appropriate for people with a family history of the disease.[127]
 Keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) rather than Whipple's procedure, particularly in terms of recovery time, is being evaluated.[128] Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique with potential for downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease, especially for tumors in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma.[129][130]
 Efforts are underway to develop new drugs, including those targeting molecular mechanisms for cancer onset,[131][132] stem cells,[85] and cell proliferation.[132][133] A further approach involves the use of immunotherapy, such as oncolytic viruses.[134] Galectin-specific mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment are under study.[135]
 The nanoparticles assist in the sustained and targeted release of a drug regimen to cancer/tumor-specific sites rather than affecting healthy cells, leading to negligible or no toxicity.[136]

 Parkinson's disease is a condition in which parts of the brain become progressively damaged over many years. The main symptoms of Parkinson's disease are: A person with Parkinson's disease can also experience a wide range of other physical and psychological symptoms. These include: See a GP if you're concerned that you may have symptoms of Parkinson's disease. They'll ask about the problems you're experiencing and may refer you to a specialist for further tests. Find out more about diagnosing Parkinson's disease Parkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This leads to a reduction in a chemical called dopamine in the brain. Dopamine plays a vital role in regulating the movement of the body. A reduction in dopamine is responsible for many of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Exactly what causes the loss of nerve cells is unclear. Most experts think that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is responsible. Most people with Parkinson's start to develop symptoms when they're over 50, although some people with the condition first experience symptoms when they're under 40. Men are slightly more likely to get Parkinson's disease than women. Although there's currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, treatments are available to help reduce the main symptoms and maintain quality of life for as long as possible. These include: You may not need any treatment during the early stages of Parkinson's disease, as symptoms are usually mild. But you may need regular appointments with your specialist so your condition can be monitored. As the condition progresses, the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can get worse and it can become increasingly difficult to carry out everyday activities without help. Many people respond well to treatment and only experience mild to moderate disability, whereas the minority may not respond as well and can, in time, become more severely disabled. Parkinson's disease does not directly cause people to die, but the condition can place great strain on the body, and can make some people more vulnerable to serious and life-threatening infections. But with advances in treatment, most people with Parkinson's disease now have a normal or near-normal life expectancy. Find out more about living with Parkinson's disease It may also be useful to read information and advice on:  Parkinson's UK is the main Parkinson's support and research charity in the UK. They can help if you're living with the disease and let you know about support groups in the area. Find out more about support groups in your local area from the Parkinson's UK website.

"Parkinson’s disease is an age-related degenerative brain condition, meaning it causes parts of your brain to deteriorate. It’s best known for causing slowed movements, tremors, balance problems and more. Most cases happen for unknown reasons, but some are inherited. The condition isn’t curable, but there are many different treatment options. Parkinson’s disease is a condition where a part of your brain deteriorates, causing more severe symptoms over time. While this condition is best known for how it affects muscle control, balance and movement, it can also cause a wide range of other effects on your senses, thinking ability, mental health and more. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy The risk of developing Parkinson’s disease naturally increases with age, and the average age at which it starts is 60 years old. It’s slightly more common in men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB) than in women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB). While Parkinson’s disease is usually age-related, it can happen in adults as young as 20 (though this is extremely rare, and often people have a parent, full sibling or child with the same condition). Parkinson’s disease is very common overall, ranking second among age-related degenerative brain diseases. It’s also the most common motor (movement-related) brain disease. Experts estimate that it affects at least 1% of people over age 60 worldwide. Advertisement Parkinson’s disease causes a specific area of your brain, the basal ganglia, to deteriorate. As this area deteriorates, you lose the abilities those areas once controlled. Researchers have uncovered that Parkinson’s disease causes a major shift in your brain chemistry. Under normal circumstances, your brain uses chemicals known as neurotransmitters to control how your brain cells (neurons) communicate with each other. When you have Parkinson’s disease, you don’t have enough dopamine, one of the most important neurotransmitters. When your brain sends activation signals that tell your muscles to move, it fine-tunes your movements using cells that require dopamine. That’s why lack of dopamine causes the slowed movements and tremors symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. As Parkinson’s disease progresses, the symptoms expand and intensify. Later stages of the disease often affect how your brain functions, causing dementia-like symptoms and depression. “Parkinsonism” is an umbrella term that describes Parkinson’s disease and conditions with similar symptoms. It can refer not only to Parkinson’s disease but also to other conditions like multiple system atrophy or corticobasal degeneration. Advertisement The best-known symptoms of Parkinson’s disease involve loss of muscle control. However, experts now know that muscle control-related issues aren’t the only possible symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Motor symptoms — which means movement-related symptoms — of Parkinson’s disease include the following: Additional motor symptoms can include: Several symptoms are possible that aren’t connected to movement and muscle control. In years past, experts believed non-motor symptoms were risk factors for this disease when seen before motor symptoms. However, there’s a growing amount of evidence that these symptoms can appear in the earliest stages of the disease. That means these symptoms might be warning signs that start years or even decades before motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms (with the potential early warning symptoms in bold) include: Parkinson’s disease can take years or even decades to cause severe effects. In 1967, two experts, Margaret Hoehn and Melvin Yahr, created the staging system for Parkinson’s disease. That staging system is no longer in widespread use because staging this condition is less helpful than determining how it affects each person’s life individually and then treating them accordingly. Today, the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is healthcare providers’ main tool to classify this disease. The MDS-UPDRS examines four different areas of how Parkinson’s disease affects you: Although there are several recognized risk factors for Parkinson’s disease, such as exposure to pesticides, for now, the only confirmed causes of Parkinson’s disease are genetic. When Parkinson’s disease isn’t genetic, experts classify it as “idiopathic” (this term comes from Greek and means “a disease of its own”). That means they don’t know exactly why it happens. Many conditions look like Parkinson’s disease but are instead parkinsonism (which refers to Parkinson’s disease-like conditions) from a specific cause like some psychiatric medications. Parkinson’s disease can have a familial cause, which means you can inherit it from one or both of your parents. However, this only makes up about 10% of all cases. Experts have linked at least seven different genes to Parkinson’s disease. They’ve linked three of those to early onset of the condition (meaning at a younger-than-usual age). Some genetic mutations also cause unique, distinguishing features. Experts believe idiopathic Parkinson’s disease happens because of problems with how your body uses a protein called α-synuclein (alpha sy-nu-clee-in). Proteins are chemical molecules that have a very specific shape. When some proteins don’t have the correct shape — a problem known as protein misfolding — your body can’t use them and can’t break them down. With nowhere to go, the proteins build up in various places or in certain cells (tangles or clumps of these proteins are called Lewy bodies). The buildup of these Lewy bodies (which doesn’t happen with some of the genetic problems that cause Parkinson’s disease) causes toxic effects and cell damage. Protein misfolding is common in many other disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, multiple forms of amyloidosis and more. There are conditions or circumstances experts have linked to parkinsonism. While these aren’t true Parkinson’s disease, they have similar features, and healthcare providers may consider these causes while diagnosing Parkinson’s disease. The possible causes are: Parkinson’s disease isn’t contagious, and you can’t contract it from another person. Diagnosing Parkinson’s disease is mostly a clinical process, meaning it relies heavily on a healthcare provider examining your symptoms, asking questions and reviewing your medical history. Some diagnostic and lab tests are possible, but these are usually needed to rule out other conditions or certain causes. But most lab tests aren’t necessary unless you don’t respond to treatment for Parkinson’s disease, which can indicate you have another condition. When healthcare providers suspect Parkinson’s disease or need to rule out other conditions, various imaging and diagnostic tests are possible. These include: Researchers have found possible ways to test for possible indicators of Parkinson’s disease. Both of these new tests involve the alpha-synuclein protein but test for it in new, unusual ways. While these tests can’t tell you what conditions you have because of misfolded alpha-synuclein proteins, that information can still help your provider make a diagnosis. The two tests use the following methods. For now, Parkinson’s disease isn’t curable, but there are multiple ways to manage its symptoms. The treatments can also vary from person to person, depending on their specific symptoms and how well certain treatments work. Medications are the primary way to treat this condition. A secondary treatment option is surgery to implant a device that will deliver a mild electrical current to part of your brain (this is known as deep brain stimulation). There are also some experimental options, such as stem cell-based treatments, but their availability often varies, and many aren’t an option for people with Parkinson’s disease. Medication treatments for Parkinson’s disease fall into two categories: Direct treatments and symptom treatments. Direct treatments target Parkinson’s itself. Symptom treatments only treat certain effects of the disease. Medications that treat Parkinson’s disease do so in multiple ways. Because of that, drugs that do one or more of the following are most likely: Several medications treat specific symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Symptoms treated often include the following: In years past, surgery was an option to intentionally damage and scar a part of your brain that was malfunctioning because of Parkinson’s disease. Today, that same effect is possible using deep-brain stimulation, which uses an implanted device to deliver a mild electrical current to those same areas. The major advantage is that deep-brain stimulation is reversible, while intentional scarring damage is not. This treatment approach is almost always an option in later stages of Parkinson’s disease when levodopa therapy becomes less effective, and in people who have tremor that doesn’t seem to respond to the usual medications. Researchers are exploring other possible treatments that could help with Parkinson’s disease. While these aren’t widely available, they do offer hope to people with this condition. Some of the experimental treatment approaches include: The complications and side effects that happen with Parkinson’s disease treatments depend on the treatments themselves, the severity of the condition, any other health issues you have, and more. Your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you more about the likely side effects and complications that you might experience. They can also tell you what you can do to minimize how those side effects or complications affect your life. More about levodopa The most common and effective treatment for Parkinson’s disease is levodopa. While this medication has greatly improved the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, providers use it cautiously because of how it works. They also commonly prescribe other medications that make levodopa more effective or help with side effects and certain symptoms. Levodopa is often combined with other medications to keep your body from processing it before it enters your brain. That helps avoid other side effects of dopamine, especially nausea, vomiting and low blood pressure when you stand up (orthostatic hypotension). Over time, the way your body uses levodopa changes, and levodopa can also lose its effectiveness. Increasing your dose can help with that, but that increases the chance and severity of side effects, and the dose can only go so high before it reaches toxic levels. Parkinson’s disease isn’t a condition you can self-diagnose, and you shouldn’t try to manage the symptoms without first talking to a healthcare provider. The time it takes to recover and see the effects of Parkinson’s disease treatments depends strongly on the type of treatments, the severity of the condition and other factors. Your healthcare provider is the best person to offer more information about what you can expect from treatment. The information they give you can consider any unique factors that might affect what you experience. Parkinson’s disease happens for either genetic reasons or unpredictably. Neither is preventable, and you can’t reduce your risk of developing it. There are certain high-risk occupations such as farming and welding, but not everyone in these professions develops parkinsonism. Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative condition, meaning the effects on your brain get worse over time. However, this condition usually takes time to get worse. Most people have a normal life span with this condition. You’ll need little to no help in the earlier stages and can keep living independently. As the effects worsen, you’ll need medication to limit how the symptoms affect you. Most medications, especially levodopa, are moderately or even very effective once your provider finds the minimum dose you need to treat your symptoms. Most of the effects and symptoms are manageable with treatment, but the treatments become less effective and more complicated over time. Living independently will also become more and more difficult as the disease worsens. Parkinson’s disease isn’t curable, which means it’s a permanent, lifelong condition. Parkinson’s disease isn’t fatal, but the symptoms and effects are often contributing factors to death. The average life expectancy for Parkinson’s disease in 1967 was a little under 10 years. Since then, the average life expectancy has increased by about 55%, rising to more than 14.5 years. That, combined with the fact that Parkinson’s diagnosis is much more likely after age 60, means this condition doesn’t often affect your life expectancy by more than a few years (depending on the life expectancy in your country). If you have Parkinson’s disease, the best thing you can do is follow the guidance of your healthcare provider on how to take care of yourself. You should see your healthcare provider as recommended, or if you notice changes in your symptoms or the effectiveness of your medication. Adjustments to medications and dosages can make a huge difference in how Parkinson’s affects your life. Your healthcare provider can give you guidance and information on signs or symptoms that mean you should go to the hospital or seek medical care. In general, you should seek care if you fall, especially when you lose consciousness or might have an injury to your head, neck, chest, back or abdomen. Experts don’t know how most cases of Parkinson’s disease happen. About 10% of cases are genetic, meaning you inherit them from one or both parents. However, the remaining 90% or so are idiopathic, which means they happen for reasons that are still unknown. Parkinson’s warning signs can be motor (movement-related) symptoms like slow movements, tremors or stiffness. However, they can also be non-motor symptoms. Many of the possible non-motor symptoms can appear years or even decades ahead of motor symptoms. But non-motor symptoms can also be vague, making it difficult to connect them to Parkinson’s disease. Non-motor symptoms that might be early warning signs include: No, Parkinson’s disease isn’t fatal on its own. But it can contribute to other conditions or problems that are sometimes fatal. No, Parkinson’s disease isn’t curable. However, it is treatable, and many treatments are highly effective. It might also be possible to delay the progress and more severe symptoms of the disease. Parkinson’s disease is a very common condition, and it’s more likely to happen to people as they get older. While Parkinson’s isn't curable, there are many ways to treat this condition. They include several different classes of medications, surgery to implant brain-stimulation devices and more. Thanks to advances in treatment and care, people can live for years or even decades with this condition and can adapt to or receive treatment for the effects and symptoms.

 Parkinson's disease (PD), or simply Parkinson's, is a long-term neurodegenerative disease of mainly the central nervous system that affects both the motor and non-motor systems of the body. The symptoms usually emerge slowly, and as the disease progresses, non-motor symptoms become more common. Usual symptoms include tremors, slowness of movement, rigidity, and difficulty with balance, collectively known as parkinsonism. Parkinson's disease dementia, falls and neuropsychiatric problems such as sleep abnormalities, psychosis, mood swings, or behavioral changes may arise in advanced stages as well.
 Most of the cases of Parkinson's disease are sporadic but a few contributing factors have been identified. Pathophysiology is characterized by nerve cell death in the locus coeruleus and substantia nigra, the latter being a midbrain region that supplies dopamine to the basal ganglia which are involved in voluntary motor control. The cause of this cell death is poorly understood but includes the alpha-synuclein aggregation into Lewy bodies within the neurons. Other possible factors involve genetic and environmental mechanisms as well as medications, lifestyle or previous conditions.
 Diagnosis is mainly based on signs and symptoms, usually motor-related, found via neurological examination, though medical imaging like neuromelanin MRI can support the diagnosis. Usual onset is in people over 60 years of age of whom about one percent are affected. In those younger than 50, it is termed early-onset PD.
 No cure is known, and treatment aims to mitigate symptoms. Initial treatment typically includes L-DOPA, MAO-B inhibitors, or dopamine agonists. As the disease progresses, these medications become less effective and produce a side effect marked by involuntary muscle movements. Diet and certain forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms. Deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce severe motor symptoms where drugs are ineffective. There is little evidence for treatment of the non-movement-related symptoms, such as sleep disturbances and mood instability. The average life expectancy is near-normal.
 Parkinsonism can be classified into different types, which include the following:[7]
 As of 2024, the classification is based on symptoms, but research aims to establish a biological basis.[8]
 PD can be classified in other ways as well. Parkinson-plus syndrome includes PD, along with other conditions.[9] It is included among the Lewy body diseases[10] and is considered a synucleinopathy, which also encompass dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, and other rarer conditions.[11] Some rare genetic forms of Parkinson's do not exhibit alpha-synuclein aggregation.[12]
 The defining symptoms affect the motor system and include tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. Other symptoms may affect the autonomic or sensory nervous system, mood, behavior, sleep pattern, or cognition.[14]
 Non-motor symptoms may precede the onset of motor symptoms by up to 20 years. These include constipation, anosmia, mood disorders, and REM sleep behavior disorder among others.[15] In general, motor symptoms such as postural instability and gait abnormalities tend to appear as the disease progresses.[16]
 Four motor symptoms are considered as cardinal signs in PD: tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability, collectively known as parkinsonism.[14] However, other motor-associated symptoms are common.
 Tremor is the most common presenting sign and may appear at rest as well as during intentional movement with a frequency between 4–6 hertz (cycles per second).[17] PD tremor tends to occur in the hands, but can affect other parts of the body, such as legs, arms, tongue, or lips, as well. It is often described as ""pill-rolling"", the tendency of the index finger and thumb to touch and perform a circular movement that reminds of the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills. Despite it being the most noticeable sign, tremor is present in only about 70–90 percent of cases.[18][17]
 Bradykinesia is often considered the most important feature of Parkinson's disease and is also present in atypical parkinsonism. It describes difficulties in motor planning, beginning, and executing, resulting in overall slowed movement with reduced amplitude which affects sequential and simultaneous tasks.[19] Hence, it interferes with daily activities such as dressing, feeding and bathing.[20] Facial muscles involved in bradykinesia lead to the characteristic reduced facial expression known as ""masked face"" or hypomimia.[21]
 Rigidity, also referred to as rigor or ""stiffness"", is the increased resistance during passive mobilization of a limb affecting up to 89 percent of cases.[22] It usually occurs after onset of tremor and bradykinesia on one or both sides of the body and can lead to muscle or joint pain as the disease progresses.[23] As of 2024, it remains unclear whether rigidity is caused by a distinct biomechanical process or if it is the manifestation of another cardinal sign of PD.[24]
 Postural instability (PI) is typical in the later stages of the disease, leading to impaired balance and falls, and secondarily to bone fractures, thus, reduced mobility and quality of life. PI is absent in the initial stages and usually occurs 10–15 years after first diagnosis. Within the first three years after disease onset, PI may indicate atypical parkinsonism.[25] While some sources may still refer to the cardinal signs as the classical triad out of tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity, PI is widely accepted as the fourth defining symptom, despite its unknown mechanism, thus forming a symptom tetrad.[26] Together with bradykinesia and rigidity, it is responsible for the typical gait characterized by short shuffling steps and forward-flexed posture.[27]
 Other common motor signs include a slurred and quiet voice, and handwriting that progressively becomes smaller. This latter may occur prior to other typical symptoms, but the exact neurobiological mechanism, and therefore possible connections with other symptoms, remains unknown.[28]
 Transformation of the sensory nervous system can lead to changes in sensation which include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia.[29] Problems with visuospatial function may arise and lead to difficulties in facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines.[30]
 Peripheral neuropathy is known to be present in up to 55 percent of PD patients. While it is responsible for most of paresthesia and pain in PD, its role in postural instability and motor impairment is poorly understood.[29]
 Alterations in the autonomic nervous system, known as dysautonomia, are associated with a variety of symptoms such as gastrointestinal dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, excessive sweating, or urinary incontinence.[31]
 Gastrointestinal issues include constipation, impaired stomach emptying, immoderate production of saliva, and swallowing difficulty (prevalence up to 82 %). Complications resulting from dysphagia include dehydration, malnutrition, weight loss, and aspiration pneumonia.[32] All gastrointestinal features can be severe enough to cause discomfort, endanger health,[33] and complicate disease management.[34] Despite being related to each other, the exact mechanism of these symptoms remains unknown.[35]
 Orthostatic hypotension is the sustained drop of blood pressure by at least 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic within the first three minutes after raising to an upright position that can be seen in 30–50 percent of cases. Low blood pressure can impair the perfusion of organs situated above the heart, particularly the brain, resulting in lightheadedness. This can eventually lead to fainting and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality.[36]
 Other autonomic-related symptoms include excessive sweating, urinary incontinence, and sexual dysfunction.[31]
 Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common and range from mild disturbances to severe impairment, comprising abnormalities in cognition, mood, behavior, or thought which can interfere with daily activities, reduce quality of life, and increase the risk for admission to a nursing home. Some of them, such as depression and anxiety, are known to precede characteristic motor signs by up to several years and may herald the development of PD, while most of them worsen as the disease progresses.[37] Research indicates, that patients with more severe motor symptoms are at higher risk for any NPS. Conversely, NPS can worsen PD.[38][39]
 Depression is the most common NPS and occurs in nearly half of all patients. It features low mood and lack of pleasure and is more prevalent in females. The diagnosis can be challenging, since some symptoms of depression, such as psychomotor retardation, memory problems, or altered appetite, share similarities with psychiatric signs caused by PD.[38] It may result in suicidal ideation which is more prevalent in PD. Nonetheless, suicidal attempts themselves are lower than in general population.[40]
 Apathy is characterized by emotional indifference and arises in about 46 percent of cases. Diagnosis is difficult, as it may become indistinct from symptoms of depression.[38]
 Anxiety disorders (AD) develop in around 43 percent of cases.[38] The most common are panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder.[37] Anxiety is known to cause deterioration in the symptoms of PD.[39]
 Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) is present in around 20 percent of cases[41] and comprises hallucinations, illusions and delusions. It is associated with dopaminergic drugs used to treat the motor symptoms, higher morbidity, mortality, a decrease in health-promoting behaviors, and longer nursing home stays. Additionally, it correlates with depression and may herald onset of dementia in advanced stages. Unlike other psychotic forms, PDP typically presents with a clear sensorium.[42] It might overlap with other psychiatric symptoms, making the diagnosis challenging.[43]
 Impulse-control disorders (ICD) can be seen in approximately 19 percent of all patients[38] and, in the context of PD, are grouped along with compulsive behavior and dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) within the broader spectrum of impulsive and compulsive behaviors (ICB). They are characterized by impulsivity and difficulty to control impulsive urges and are positively correlated with the use of dopamine agonists.[44]
 Cognitive disturbances can occur in early stages or before diagnosis, and increase in prevalence and severity with duration of the disease. Ranging from mild cognitive impairment to severe Parkinson's disease dementia, they feature executive dysfunction, slowed cognitive processing speed, and disrupted perception and estimation of time.[45]
 Sleep disorders are common in PD and affect about two thirds of all patients.[46] They comprise insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), restless legs syndrome (RLS), REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and can be worsened by medication. RBD may begin years prior to the initial motor symptoms. Individual presentation of symptoms vary, although most of people affected by PD show an altered circadian rhythm at some point of disease progression.[47][48]
 PD is associated with a variety of skin disorders that include melanoma, seborrheic dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, and rosacea.[49] Seborrheic dermatitis is recognized as a premotor feature that indicates dysautonomia and demonstrates that PD can be detected not only by changes of nervous tissue, but tissue abnormalities outside the nervous system as well.[50]
 As of 2024, the underlying cause of PD is unknown,[9] yet is assumed to be influenced primarily by an interaction of genetic and environmental factors.[51] Nonetheless, the most significant risk factor is age with a prevalence of 1 percent in those aged over 65 and approximately 4.3 percent in age over 85.[52] Genetic components comprise SNCA, LRRK2, and PARK2 among others, while environmental risks include exposure to pesticides or heavy metals.[53] Timing of exposure factor may influence the progression or severity of certain stages.[54]: 46  However, caffeine and nicotine exhibit neuroprotective features, hence lowering the risk of PD.[55][56] About 85 percent of cases occur sporadic, meaning that there is no family history.[57]
 PD, in a narrow sense, can be seen as a genetic disease; heritability is estimated to lie between 22 and 40 percent,[51] across different ethnicities.[58] Around 15 percent of diagnosed individuals have a family history, from which 5–10 percent can be attributed to a causative risk gene mutation, although harboring one of these mutations may not lead to the disease.[57]
 As of 2024, around 90 genetic risk variants across 78 genomic loci have been identified.[59] Notable risk genes include SNCA, LRRK2, and VPS35 for autosomal dominant inheritance, and PRKN, PINK1, and DJ1 for autosomal recessive inheritance.[51] Additionally, mutations in the GBA1 gene, linked to Gaucher's disease, are found in 5–10 percent of PD cases.[60]
 Alpha-synuclein (aSyn), a protein encoded by SNCA gene, is thought to be primarily responsible Lewy body aggregation.[61] ASyn activates ATM serine/threonine kinase, a major DNA damage-repair signaling kinase,[62] and non-homologous end joining DNA repair pathway.[62]
 Identifying environmental risk factors and causality is difficult due to the disease's often decade-long prodromal period.[54]: 46  Most noteworthy environmental factors include pesticide exposure and contact with heavy metals.
 In particular, exposure to pesticides such as paraquat, rotenone, benomyl, and mancozeb causes one in five cases,[63] implying an association with the onset of PD.[54] Risk is increased by co-exposure to, for example, glyphosate and MPTP.[64]
 Harmful heavy metals include mainly manganese, iron, lead, mercury,[65] aluminium, and cadmium. On the other hand, magnesium shows neuroprotective features.[66]
 Other chemical compounds include trichloroethylene[67] and MPTP.[68]
 Traumatic brain injury is also strongly implicated as a risk factor.[69] Additionally, although the underlying cause is unknown, melanoma is documented to be associated with PD.[70] Low levels of urate in the blood are associated with an increased risk[71] while Helicobacter pylori infection can prevent the absorption of some drugs, including L-DOPA.[72]
 Main pathological feature is cell death of dopamine-releasing neurons within the basal ganglia, more precisely pars compacta of substantia nigra and partially putamen of striatum, thus impeding nigrostriatal pathway of the dopaminergic system which plays a central role in motor control.[73]
 Three major pathways connect the basal ganglia to other brain areas: direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathway, all part of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop.[74]
 Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a protein involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking, intracellular transport, and neurotransmitter release. In PD, it can be overexpressed, misfolded and subsequently form clumps[75] on axon terminals and other structures inside a neuron, for example the mitochondria and nucleus. This aggregation forms Lewy bodies which are involved in neuronal necrosis and dysfunction of neurotransmitters.[citation needed]
 A vicious cycle linked to neurodegeneration involves oxidative stress, mitochondria, and neuroimmune function, particularly inflammation. Normal metabolism of dopamine tends to fail, leading to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which is cytotoxic and causes cellular damage to lipids, proteins, DNA, and especially mitochondria.[76] Mitochondrial damage triggers neuroinflammatory responses via damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), resulting in aggregation of neuromelanin, and therefore, fueling further neuroinflammation by activating microglia.[77]
 Ferroptosis is suggested as another significant mechanism in disease progression. It is characterized by cell death through high levels of lipid hydroperoxide.[78]
 One mechanism causing brain cell death results from abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurons forming inclusions, known as Lewy bodies.[79][80] These bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or have early nonmotor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain, and finally, the neocortex.[79] These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD, but Lewy bodies may be protective from cell death (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g. oligomers) that are not aggregated into Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, may in fact be the toxic forms of the protein.[81][80] In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are uncommon unless the person has dementia.[82][page needed]
 Other mechanisms include proteasomal and lysosomal systems dysfunction and reduced mitochondrial activity.[81] Iron accumulation in the substantia nigra is typically observed in conjunction with the protein inclusions. It may be related to oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and neuronal death, but the mechanisms are obscure.[83]
 The neuroimmune interaction is heavily implicated in PD pathology. PD and autoimmune disorders share genetic variations and molecular pathways. Some autoimmune diseases may even increase one's risk of developing PD, up to 33% in one study.[84] Autoimmune diseases linked to protein expression profiles of monocytes and CD4+ T cells are linked to PD. Herpes virus infections can trigger autoimmune reactions to alpha-synuclein, perhaps through molecular mimicry of viral proteins.[85] Alpha-synuclein, and its aggregate form, Lewy bodies, can bind to microglia. Microglia can proliferate and be over-activated by alpha-synuclein binding to MHC receptors on inflammasomes, bringing about a release of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, IFNγ, and TNFα.[86]
 Activated microglia influence the activation of astrocytes, converting their neuroprotective phenotype to a neurotoxic one. Astrocytes in healthy brains serve to protect neuronal connections. In Parkinson's disease, astrocytes cannot protect the dopaminergic connections in the striatum. Microglia present antigens via MHC-I and MHC-II to T cells. CD4+ T cells, activated by this process, are able to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and release more proinflammatory cytokines, like interferon-γ (IFNγ), TNFα, and IL-1β. Mast cell degranulation and subsequent proinflammatory cytokine release is implicated in BBB breakdown in PD. Another immune cell implicated in PD are peripheral monocytes and have been found in the substantia nigra of people with PD. These monocytes can lead to more dopaminergic connection breakdown. In addition, monocytes isolated from people with Parkinson's disease express higher levels of the PD-associated protein, LRRK2, compared with non-PD individuals via vasodilation.[87] In addition, high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, can lead to the production of C-reactive protein by the liver, another protein commonly found in people with PD, that can lead to an increase in peripheral inflammation.[88][89]
 Peripheral inflammation can affect the gut-brain axis, an area of the body highly implicated in PD. People with PD have altered gut microbiota and colon problems years before motor issues arise.[88][89] Alpha-synuclein is produced in the gut and may migrate via the vagus nerve to the brainstem, and then to the substantia nigra.[undue weight? – discuss][better source needed][90]
 Physician's initial assessment is typically based on medical history and neurological examination.[91] They assess motor symptoms (bradykinesia, rest tremors, etc.) using clinical diagnostic criteria. The finding of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on autopsy is usually considered final proof that the person had PD. The clinical course of the illness over time may diverge from PD, requiring that presentation is periodically reviewed to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis.[91][92]
 Multiple causes can occur for parkinsonism or diseases that look similar. Stroke, certain medications, and toxins can cause ""secondary parkinsonism"" and need to be assessed during visit.[93][92] Parkinson-plus syndromes, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy, must be considered and ruled out appropriately to begin a different treatment and disease progression (anti-Parkinson's medications are typically less effective at controlling symptoms in Parkinson-plus syndromes).[91] Faster progression rates, early cognitive dysfunction or postural instability, minimal tremor, or symmetry at onset may indicate a Parkinson-plus disease rather than PD itself.[94]
 Medical organizations have created diagnostic criteria to ease and standardize the diagnostic process, especially in the early stages of the disease. The most widely known criteria come from the UK Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Disorders and the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The Queen Square Brain Bank criteria require slowness of movement (bradykinesia) plus either rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability. Other possible causes of these symptoms need to be ruled out. Finally, three or more of the following supportive symptoms are required during onset or evolution: unilateral onset, tremor at rest, progression in time, asymmetry of motor symptoms, response to levodopa for at least five years, the clinical course of at least ten years and appearance of dyskinesias induced by the intake of excessive levodopa.[95] Assessment of sudomotor function through electrochemical skin conductance can be helpful in diagnosing dysautonomia.[96]
 When PD diagnoses are checked by autopsy, movement disorders experts are found on average to be 79.6% accurate at initial assessment and 83.9% accurate after refining diagnoses at follow-up examinations. When clinical diagnoses performed mainly by nonexperts are checked by autopsy, the average accuracy is 73.8%. Overall, 80.6% of PD diagnoses are accurate, and 82.7% of diagnoses using the Brain Bank criteria are accurate.[97]
 Computed tomography (CT) scans of people with PD usually appear normal.[98] Magnetic resonance imaging has become more accurate in diagnosis of the disease over time, specifically through iron-sensitive T2* and susceptibility weighted imaging sequences at a magnetic field strength of at least 3T, both of which can demonstrate absence of the characteristic 'swallow tail' imaging pattern in the dorsolateral substantia nigra.[99] In a meta-analysis, absence of this pattern was highly sensitive and specific for the disease.[100] A meta-analysis found that neuromelanin-MRI can discriminate individuals with Parkinson's from healthy subjects.[101] Diffusion MRI has shown potential in distinguishing between PD and Parkinson-plus syndromes, as well as between PD motor subtypes,[102] though its diagnostic value is still under investigation.[98] CT and MRI are used to rule out other diseases that can be secondary causes of parkinsonism, most commonly encephalitis and chronic ischemic insults, as well as less-frequent entities such as basal ganglia tumors and hydrocephalus.[98]
 The metabolic activity of dopamine transporters in the basal ganglia can be directly measured with positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography scans. It has shown high agreement with clinical diagnoses of PD.[103] Reduced dopamine-related activity in the basal ganglia can help exclude drug-induced Parkinsonism. This finding is nonspecific and can be seen with both PD and Parkinson-plus disorders.[98] In the United States, DaTSCANs are only FDA approved to distinguish PD or Parkinsonian syndromes from essential tremor.[104]
 Iodine-123-meta-iodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy can help locate denervation of the muscles of the heart which can support a PD diagnosis.[93]
 Secondary parkinsonism – The multiple causes of parkinsonism can be differentiated through careful history, physical examination, and appropriate imaging.[93][105] Other Parkinson-plus syndromes can have similar movement symptoms but have a variety of associated symptoms. Some of these are also synucleinopathies. Lewy body dementia involves motor symptoms with early onset of cognitive dysfunction and hallucinations which precede motor symptoms. Alternatively, multiple systems atrophy or MSA usually has early onset of autonomic dysfunction (such as orthostasis), and may have autonomic predominance, cerebellar symptom predominance, or Parkinsonian predominance.[106]
 Other Parkinson-plus syndromes involve tau, rather than alpha-synuclein. These include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). PSP predominantly involves rigidity, early falls, bulbar symptoms, and vertical gaze restriction; it can be associated with frontotemporal dementia symptoms. CBS involves asymmetric parkinsonism, dystonia, alien limb, and myoclonic jerking.[107] Presentation timelines and associated symptoms can help differentiate similar movement disorders from idiopathic Parkinson disease.[medical citation needed]
 Vascular parkinsonism is the phenomenon of the presence of Parkinson's disease symptoms combined with findings of vascular events (such as a cerebral stroke). The damaging of the dopaminergic pathways is similar in cause for both vascular parkinsonism and idiopathic PD, and so present with similar symptoms. Differentiation can be made with careful bedside examination, history evaluation, and imaging.[108][109]
 Parkinson-plus syndrome – Multiple diseases can be considered part of the Parkinson's plus group, including corticobasal syndrome, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and dementia with Lewy bodies. Differential diagnosis can be narrowed down with careful history and physical exam (especially focused on the sequential onset of specific symptoms), progression of the disease, and response to treatment.[110][105] Some key symptoms:[111][105]
 Other conditions that can have similar presentations to PD include:[105][111]
 Exercise in middle age may reduce the risk of PD later in life.[112] A review of studies regarding how physical activity (exercise) prevents Parkinson's disease noted a 34% reduction in risk amongst individuals who perform moderate to vigorous physical activity. The potential benefits of exercise in individuals with Parkinson's disease are being researched.[113]
 Caffeine appears protective with a greater decrease in risk occurring with a larger intake of caffeinated beverages such as coffee.[114]
 Antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, have been proposed to protect against the disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been shown.[115] The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory.[115] Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and calcium channel blockers may be protective.[116] A 2010 meta-analysis found that NSAIDs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15% (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction in the incidence of the development of PD.[117] As of 2019[update] meta-analyses have failed to confirm this link. Multiple studies have demonstrated a link between the use of ibuprofen and a decreased risk of Parkinson's development.[118]
 Despite ongoing research efforts, Parkinson's disease has no known cure. Patients are typically managed by a holistic approach that combines lifestyle modifications with physical therapy. Certain medications may also be used to provide symptomatic relief and improve the patient's quality of life. The medications used in Parkinson's disease work by either increasing endogenous dopamine levels or by directly mimicking dopamine's effect on the patient's brain. Levodopa (L-dopa) is the most effective for motor symptoms and is often combined with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (such as carbidopa or benserazide).[119] Other agents include COMT inhibitors, dopamine agonists, and MAO-B inhibitors. The patient's age at disease onset as well as the stage of the disease often help determine which of the aforementioned drug groups is most effective.
 Braak staging classifies the degree of pathology in patients with Parkinson's disease into six stages that correlate with early, middle, and late presentations of the disease.[120] Treatment in the first stage aims for an optimal trade-off between symptom control and medication side effects. For example, the administration of levodopa in this stage may be delayed in favor of other agents, such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists, due to its notable risk of complications.[121] However, levodopa-related dyskinesias still correlate more strongly with the duration and severity of the disease than the duration of levodopa treatment.[122] A careful consideration of the risks and benefits of starting treatment is crucial to optimize patient outcomes. In the middle stages of Parkinson's disease, the primary aim is to reduce patient symptoms. Episodes of medication overuse or any sudden withdrawals from medication must be promptly managed.[121] If medications prove ineffective, surgery (such as deep brain stimulation or high-intensity focused ultrasound[123]), subcutaneous waking-day apomorphine infusion, and enteral dopa pumps may be useful.[124] Late-stage Parkinson's disease presents challenges requiring a variety of treatments, including those for psychiatric symptoms particularly depression, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, and erectile dysfunction.[124] In the final stages of the disease, palliative care is provided to improve a person's quality of life.[125]
 A 2020 Cochrane review found no certain evidence that cognitive training is beneficial for people with Parkinson's disease, dementia or mild cognitive impairment.[126] The findings are based on low certainty evidence of seven studies.
 No standard treatment for PD-associated anxiety exists.[127][page needed]
 Levodopa is usually the first drug of choice when treating Parkinson's disease and has been the most widely used PD treatment since the 1980s.[121][128] The motor symptoms of PD are the result of reduced dopamine production in the brain's basal ganglia. Dopamine fails to cross the blood–brain barrier so it cannot be taken as a medicine to boost the brain's depleted levels of dopamine. A precursor of dopamine, levodopa, can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to dopamine. Administration of levodopa temporarily diminishes the motor symptoms of PD.
 Only 5–10% of levodopa crosses the blood–brain barrier. Much of the remainder is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of side-effects, including nausea, vomiting, and orthostatic hypotension.[129] Carbidopa and benserazide are dopa decarboxylase inhibitors that fail to cross the blood–brain barrier and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing side-effects and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of these drugs is usually taken along with levodopa and is available combined with levodopa in the same pill.[130]
 Prolonged use of levodopa is associated with the development of complications, such as involuntary movements (dyskinesias) and fluctuations in the impact of the medication.[121] When fluctuations occur, a person can cycle through phases with good response to medication and reduced PD symptoms (""on state""), and phases with poor response to medication and increased PD symptoms (""off state"").[121][131] Using lower doses of levodopa may reduce the risk and severity of these levodopa-induced complications.[132] A former strategy, called ""drug holidays"", to reduce levodopa-related dyskinesia and fluctuations was to withdraw levodopa medication for some time,[128] which can bring on dangerous side-effects such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and is discouraged.[121] Most people with PD eventually need levodopa and later develop levodopa-induced fluctuations and dyskinesias.[121] Adverse effects of levodopa, including dyskinesias, may mistakenly influence people affected by the disease and sometimes their healthcare professionals to delay treatment, which reduces potential for optimal results.[medical citation needed]
 Levodopa is available in oral, inhalation, and infusion form; inhaled levodopa can be used when oral levodopa therapy has reached a point where ""off"" periods have increased in length.[133][134]
 During the course of PD, affected people can experience a wearing-off phenomenon, where a recurrence of symptoms occurs after a dose of levodopa, but right before their next dose.[93] Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a protein that degrades levodopa before it can cross the blood–brain barrier and COMT inhibitors allow for more levodopa to cross.[136] They are normally used in the management of later symptoms, but can be used in conjunction with levodopa/carbidopa when a person is experiencing the wearing off-phenomenon with their motor symptoms.[93][128]
 Three COMT inhibitors are used to treat adults with PD and end-of-dose motor fluctuations – opicapone, entacapone, and tolcapone.[93] Tolcapone has been available for but its usefulness is limited by possible liver damage complications requiring liver-function monitoring.[137][93][136][111] Entacapone and opicapone cause little alteration to liver function.[136][138][139] Licensed preparations of entacapone contain entacapone alone or in combination with carbidopa and levodopa.[140][111][141] Opicapone is a once-daily COMT inhibitor.[142][93]
 Dopamine agonists that bind to dopamine receptors in the brain have similar effects to levodopa.[121] These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy, thus delaying the onset of levodopa's complications.[121][143] Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine, and lisuride.
 Though dopamine agonists are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms, they are effective enough to manage these symptoms in the first years of treatment.[144] Dyskinesias due to dopamine agonists are rare in younger people who have PD, but along with other complications, become more common with older age at onset.[144] Thus, dopamine agonists are the preferred initial treatment for younger-onset PD, and levodopa is preferred for older-onset PD.[144]
 Dopamine agonists produce side effects, including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation.[121][128] Side effects appear with minimal clinically effective doses giving the physician reason to search for a different drug.[121] Agonists have been related to impulse-control disorders (such as increased sexual activity, eating, gambling, and shopping) more strongly than other antiparkinson medications.[145][128]
 Apomorphine, a dopamine agonist, may be used to reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD.[121] It is administered only by intermittent injections or continuous subcutaneous infusions.[121] Secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored.[121] Two dopamine agonists administered through skin patches (lisuride and rotigotine) are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in advanced states.[146][page needed] Due to an increased risk of cardiac fibrosis with ergot-derived dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, cabergoline, dihydroergocryptine, lisuride, and pergolide), they should only be considered for adjunct therapy to levodopa.[128]
 MAO-B inhibitors (safinamide, selegiline and rasagiline) increase the amount of dopamine in the basal ganglia by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase B, an enzyme that breaks down dopamine.[121] They have been found to help alleviate motor symptoms when used as monotherapy (on their own); when used in conjunction with levodopa, time spent in the off phase is reduced.[147][128] Selegiline has been shown to delay the need for beginning levodopa, suggesting that it might be neuroprotective and slow the progression of the disease.[148] An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this has been refuted.[149]
 Common side effects are nausea, dizziness, insomnia, sleepiness, and (in selegiline and rasagiline) orthostatic hypotension.[148][93] MAO-Bs are known to increase serotonin and cause a potentially dangerous condition known as serotonin syndrome.[148]
 Other drugs such as amantadine may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms, but evidence for use is lacking.[121][150] Anticholinergics should not be used for dyskinesia or motor fluctuations but may be considered topically for drooling.[128] A diverse range of symptoms beyond those related to motor function can be treated pharmaceutically.[151] Examples are the use of quetiapine or clozapine for psychosis, cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine for dementia, and modafinil for excessive daytime sleepiness.[151][152][128] In 2016, pimavanserin was approved for the management of PD psychosis.[153] Doxepin and rasagline may reduce physical fatigue in PD.[154]
 Treating motor symptoms with surgery was once a common practice but the discovery of levodopa has decreased the amount of procedures.[155] Studies have led to great improvements in surgical techniques, so surgery can be used in people with advanced PD for whom drug therapy is no longer sufficient.[155] Surgery for PD can be divided in two main groups – lesional and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Target areas for DBS or lesions include the thalamus, globus pallidus, or subthalamic nucleus.[155] DBS involves the implantation of a medical device called a neurostimulator, which sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain. DBS is recommended for people who have PD with motor fluctuations and tremor inadequately controlled by medication, or to those who are intolerant to medication lacking severe neuropsychiatric problems.[156] Other less common surgical therapies involve intentional formation of lesions to suppress overactivity of specific subcortical areas. For example, pallidotomy involves surgical destruction of the globus pallidus to control dyskinesia.[155]
 Four areas of the brain have been treated with neural stimulators in PD.[157] These are the globus pallidus interna, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, and pedunculopontine nucleus. DBS of the globus pallidus interna improves motor function, while DBS of the thalamic DBS improves tremor, but has little impact on bradykinesia or rigidity. DBS of the subthalamic nucleus is usually avoided if a history of depression or neurocognitive impairment is present. DBS of the subthalamic nucleus is associated with a reduction in medication. Pedunculopontine nucleus DBS remains experimental at present. Generally, DBS is associated with 30–60% improvement in motor score evaluations.[157]
 Exercise programs are recommended in people with PD and recent reviews (2023) have demonstrated their efficacy.[158][needs update][112] Some evidence shows that speech or mobility problems can improve with rehabilitation, although studies are scarce and of low quality.[159][160] Regular physical exercise with or without physical therapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life.[160] When an exercise program is performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist, more improvements occur in motor symptoms, mental and emotional functions, daily living activities, and quality of life compared with a self-supervised exercise program at home.[161] Clinical exercises may be an effective intervention targeting overall well-being of individuals with Parkinson's. Improvement in motor function and depression may happen.[162]
 In improving flexibility and range of motion for people experiencing rigidity, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking have been found to decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, diaphragmatic breathing, and meditation techniques.[163] As for gait and addressing the challenges associated with the disease such as hypokinesia, shuffling, and decreased arm swing, physiotherapists have a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety. Areas of interest concerning gait during rehabilitation programs focus on improving gait speed, the base of support, stride length, and trunk and arm-swing movement. Strategies include using assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual, and auditory), exercises (marching and PNF patterns), and altering environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed).[164] Strengthening exercises have shown improvements in strength and motor function for people with primary muscular weakness and weakness related to inactivity with mild to moderate PD, but reports show an interaction between strength and the time the medications were taken. Therefore, people with PD should perform exercises 45 minutes to one hour after medications when they are capable.[165] Deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises are beneficial in improving chest-wall mobility and vital capacity decreased by a forward flexed posture and respiratory dysfunctions in advanced PD.[166] Exercise may improve constipation.[167] Whether exercise reduces physical fatigue in PD remains unclear.[154]
 Strength training exercise has been shown to increase manual dexterity in people with PD after exercising with manual putty. Improvements in both manual dexterity and strength can have a favorable impact on people with Parkinson's disease, fostering increased independence in daily activities that require grasping objects.[168]
 The Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT) is one of the most widely practiced treatments for speech disorders associated with PD.[159][169] Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve speech.[159] Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in a large percentage of their daily living activities.[159] Few studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of OT, and their quality is poor, although with some indication that it may improve motor skills and quality of life for the duration of the therapy.[159][170]
 The goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life for both the patient and family by providing relief from the symptoms and stress of illnesses.[171] As Parkinson's is uncurable, treatments focus on slowing decline and improving quality of life and are therefore palliative.[172]
 Palliative care should be involved earlier, rather than later, in the disease course.[173][174] Palliative care specialists can help with physical symptoms, emotional factors such as loss of function and jobs, depression, fear, and existential concerns.[173][174][175]
 Along with offering emotional support to both the affected person and family, palliative care addresses goals of care. People with PD may have difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses, such as wishes for feeding tube, noninvasive ventilator or tracheostomy, wishes for or against cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and when to use hospice care.[172] Palliative-care team members can help answer questions and guide people with PD on these complex and emotional topics to help them make decisions based on values.[174][176]
 Muscles and nerves that control the digestive process may be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (prolonged emptying of stomach contents).[167] A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended, and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize the consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction.[167] As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may appear. Using thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating may be useful; both measures reduce the risk of choking. Gastrostomy can be used to deliver food directly into the stomach.[167]
 Levodopa and proteins use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access.[167] Taking them together results in reduced effectiveness of the drug.[167] Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive protein consumption is discouraged in favour of a well-balanced Mediterranean diet. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons.[167] To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals.[167] At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.[167]
 PD invariably progresses with time. A severity rating method known as the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) is the most commonly used metric for a clinical study. A modified version known as the MDS-UPDRS is also used. An older scaling method known as the Hoehn and Yahr scale (originally published in 1967), and a similar scale known as the Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale, have been used. The Hoehn and Yahr scale defines five basic stages of progression.
 Motor symptoms may advance aggressively in the early stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, individuals are expected to lose independent ambulation after an average of eight years and be bedridden after 10 years. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms. In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years.
 Two distinct subtypes of PD progression have been described and were validated in several PD cohorts: First, a fast-progressing PD subtype characterized by a more rapid progression of cognitive, neuropsychiatric and autonomic symptoms, higher gait impairment, increased mortality, and a faster neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra. Second, a slow-progressing PD subtype with milder disease progression and lower mortality.[177]
 Predicting what course the disease will take for a given individual is difficult.[177][178] Higher age, earlier onset of RBD symptoms, lower education and less asymmetry of PD motor symptoms are associated with a faster disease progression.[177] The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.[81]
 No hard correlation between PD progression and PD disability as a whole has been found as of 2023; however, initial PD disability often mainly concerns the motor symptoms, whereas in later stages it is often mainly related to the non-motor symptoms of the disease. Therapies exist that can improve or alleviate these latter symptoms to some extent.[81][178] As the disease advances, disability is more related to motor symptoms that are uncontrollable by medication (such as dysphagia, dysarthria, and problems with gait or balance) and to levodopa-induced complications, which appear in up to 50% of individuals after five years of levodopa usage. Finally, after ten years most people with the disease have autonomic disturbances, sleep problems, mood alterations and cognitive decline; these symptoms, especially cognitive decline, greatly increase disability.[81][178]
 The life expectancy of people with PD is reduced. Mortality ratios are around twice those of unaffected people. Cognitive decline and dementia, old age at onset, a more advanced disease state, and presence of swallowing problems are all mortality risk factors. A disease pattern mainly characterized by tremor as opposed to rigidity, though, predicts an improved survival. Aspiration pneumonia is the leading cause of death and  twice as common in individuals with PD as in the healthy population.[178][179]
 In 2016, PD resulted in about 211,000 deaths globally, an increase of 161% since 1990.[180] The overall death rate increased by 19% to 1.81 per 100,000 people during that time.[180]
 A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared with the general population.[91][181] Up to 78% of people with PD have Parkinson's disease dementia.[182] Dementia is associated with a reduced quality of life in people with PD and their caregivers, increased mortality, and a higher probability of needing nursing home care.[181]
 PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and affects approximately six million people globally.[183] As of 2021, Parkinson's was the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disease globally in both death and prevalence.[184] The proportion in a population at a given time is about 0.3% in industrialized countries. PD is more common in the elderly and rates rise from 1% in those over 60 years of age to 4% of the population over 80.[115][185] The mean age of onset is around 60 years, although 5–10% begin between the ages of 20 and 50 is classified as young onset PD.[144] Males are affected at a ratio of around 3:2 compared with females.[116] PD may be less prevalent in those of African and Asian ancestry (including South Asians), although this finding is disputed.[115] The number of new diagnoses per year of PD is between 8–18 per 100,000 person–years.[115]
 China is predicted to have nearly half of the Parkinson's disease population in the world in 2030.[186] By 2040 the number of patients is expected to grow to approximately 14 million people; this growth has been referred to as the Parkinson's pandemic.[187]
 The prevalence of dementia increases with age, and to a lesser degree, duration of the disease.[188]
 Early sources, including an Egyptian papyrus, an ayurvedic medical treatise, the Bible, and Galen's writings, describe symptoms resembling those of PD.[191] After Galen, no references unambiguously related to PD appear until the 17th century.[191] In the 17th and 18th centuries, Franciscus Sylvius, Hieronymus David Gaubius, John Hunter and Auguste François Chomel wrote about elements of the disease.[191][192][193]
 Despite that the first systematic description of the disease is attributed to James Parkinson,  the disease itself with all four cardinal signs (tremor, bradykinesia, rigor and postural instability) was described in 1690 by Ferenc Pápai Páriz, in a Hungarian medical text over 120 years before the classical description of James Parkinson. However, as it was published in Hungarian language, his book was ignored in the western medical literature.[194][195][196]
 In 1817, James Parkinson published his essay reporting six people with paralysis agitans.[197] An Essay on the Shaking Palsy described the characteristic resting tremor, abnormal posture and gait, paralysis and diminished muscle strength, and the way that the disease progresses over time.[198][199] Early neurologists who made further additions to the knowledge of the disease include Trousseau, Gowers, Kinnier Wilson and Erb, and Jean-Martin Charcot, whose studies between 1868 and 1881 increased the understanding of the disease.[197] Among other advances, Charcot made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and bradykinesia.[197] He championed the renaming of the disease in honor of James Parkinson.[197]
 In 1912, Frederic Lewy described microscopic particles in affected brains, later named Lewy bodies.[197] In 1919, Konstantin Tretiakoff reported that the substantia nigra was the main cerebral structure affected, but this finding was rejected until it was confirmed by further studies published by Rolf Hassler in 1938.[197] The underlying biochemical changes in the brain were identified in the 1950s, due largely to the work of Arvid Carlsson on the neurotransmitter dopamine and Oleh Hornykiewicz on its role on PD.[200] In 1997, alpha-synuclein was found to be the main component of Lewy bodies by Spillantini, Trojanowski, Goedert, and others.[80]
 Anticholinergics and surgery (lesioning of the corticospinal pathway or some of the basal ganglia structures) were the only treatments until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically.[192][201] Levodopa was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received little attention until the mid 20th century.[200] It entered clinical practice in 1967 and brought about a revolution in the management of PD.[200][202] By the late 1980s deep brain stimulation introduced by Alim Louis Benabid and colleagues at Grenoble, France, emerged as a possible treatment.[203]
 An illustration of advanced Parkinson's disease by William Richard Gowers was published in 1886 in A Manual of Diseases of the Nervous System, based on 1879 photographs attributed to Albert Londe.[189][190] A new image was created in 2020 to represent diversity in levels of severity.[204][205]
 For some people with PD, masked facial expressions and difficulty moderating facial expressions of emotion or recognizing other people's facial expressions can impact social well-being.[206] As the condition progresses, tremor, other motor symptoms, difficulty communicating, or issues with mobility may interfere with social engagement, causing individuals with PD to feel isolated.[207] Public perception and awareness of PD symptoms such as shaking, hallucinating, slurring speech, and being off balance is lacking in some countries and can lead to stigma.[207]
 The costs of PD to society are high; in 2007, the largest share of direct cost came from inpatient care and nursing homes, while the share coming from medication was substantially lower.[208] Indirect costs are high, due to reduced productivity and the burden on caregivers.[208] In addition to economic costs, PD reduces quality of life of those with the disease and their caregivers.[208]
 A study based on 2017 data estimated the US economic PD burden at $51.9 billion, including direct medical costs of $25.4 billion and $26.5 billion in indirect and non-medical costs. The projected total economic burden surpasses $79 billion by 2037. These findings highlight the need for interventions to reduce PD incidence, delay disease progression, and alleviate symptom burden that may reduce the future economic burden of PD.[209]
 The birthday of James Parkinson, 11 April, has been designated as World Parkinson's Day.[197] A red tulip was chosen by international organizations as the symbol of the disease in 2005; it represents the 'James Parkinson' tulip cultivar, registered in 1981 by a Dutch horticulturalist.[210]
 Advocacy organizations include the National Parkinson Foundation, which has provided more than $180 million in care, research, and support services since 1982,[211] Parkinson's Disease Foundation, which has distributed more than $115 million for research and nearly $50 million for education and advocacy programs since its founding in 1957 by William Black;[212][213] the American Parkinson Disease Association, founded in 1961;[214] and the European Parkinson's Disease Association, founded in 1992.[215]
 In the 21st century, the diagnosis of Parkinson's among notable figures has increased the public's understanding of the disorder.[216]
 Actor Michael J. Fox was diagnosed with PD at 29 years old,[217] and has used his diagnosis to increase awareness of the disease.[218] To illustrate the effects of the disease, Fox has appeared without medication in television roles and before the United States Congress.[219] The Michael J. Fox Foundation, which he founded in 2000, has raised over $2 billion for Parkinson's research.[220] Boxer Muhammad Ali showed signs of PD when he was 38, but was undiagnosed until he was 42, and has been called the ""world's most famous Parkinson's patient"".[221] Whether he had PD or parkinsonism related to boxing is unresolved.[222][223] Cyclist and Olympic medalist Davis Phinney, diagnosed with Parkinson's at 40, started the Davis Phinney Foundation in 2004 to support PD research.[224][225] Deng Xiaoping, former paramount leader of China, had advanced Parkinson's disease.[226][227][228]
 At the time of his suicide in 2014, Robin Williams, the American actor and comedian, had been diagnosed with PD,[229] but his autopsy revealed dementia with Lewy bodies, highlighting difficulties in accurate diagnosis.[229][230][231][232][233]
 As of 2022[update], no disease-modifying drugs (drugs that target the causes or damage) are approved for Parkinson's, so this is a major focus of Parkinson's research.[234][235] Active research directions include the search for new animal models of the disease and studies of the potential usefulness of gene therapy, stem cell transplants, and neuroprotective agents.[236] To aid in earlier diagnosis, research criteria for identifying prodromal biomarkers of the disease have been established.[237]
 Gene therapy typically involves the use of a noninfectious virus[238] to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. Approaches have involved the expression of growth factors to prevent damage (Neurturin – a GDNF-family growth factor), and enzymes such as glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD – the enzyme that produces GABA), tyrosine hydroxylase (the enzyme that produces L-DOPA) and catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT – the enzyme that converts L-DOPA to dopamine). No safety concerns have been reported but the approaches have largely failed in phase two clinical trials.[236] The delivery of GAD showed promise in phase two trials in 2011, but while effective at improving motor function, was inferior to DBS. Follow-up studies in the same cohort have suggested persistent improvement.[239]
 A vaccine that primes the human immune system to destroy alpha-synuclein, PD01A, entered clinical trials and a phase one report in 2020 suggested safety and tolerability.[240][241] In 2018, an antibody, PRX002/RG7935, showed preliminary safety evidence in stage I trials supporting continuation to stage II trials.[242]
 In contrast to other neurodegenerative disorders, many Parkinson's symptoms can be attributed to the loss of a single cell type: mesencephalic dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Consequently, DA neuron regeneration is a promising therapeutic approach.[243] Although most initial research sought to generate DA neuron precursor cells from fetal brain tissue,[244] pluripotent stem cells—particularly induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)—have become an increasingly popular tissue source.[245][246]
 Both fetal and iPSC-derived DA neurons have been transplanted into patients in clinical trials.[247][248]: 1926  Although some patients see improvements, the results are highly variable. Adverse effects, such as dyskinesia arising from excess dopamine release by the transplanted tissues, have also been observed.[249][250]
 Antagonists of adenosine receptors (specifically A2A) have been explored for Parkinson's.[251] Of these, istradefylline has emerged as the most successful medication and was approved for medical use in the United States in 2019.[252] It is approved as an add-on treatment to the levodopa/carbidopa regime.[252] LRRK2 kinase inhibitors are also of interest.[253]
 Neurodegeneration is proposed to originate in the brainstem and olfactory bulb.[254]

"Porphyria (por-FEAR-e-uh) refers to a group of rare disorders that result from a buildup of natural chemicals called porphyrins in the body. Porphyrins are needed to make heme, a part of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells. It carries oxygen to the body's organs and tissues. Eight enzymes are needed to change porphyrins into heme. Without enough of any of these enzymes, porphyrins build up in the body. High levels of porphyrins can cause major problems, mainly in the nervous system and skin. There are two general types of porphyrias. Acute porphyrias start rapidly and mainly affect the nervous system. Cutaneous porphyrias mainly affect the skin. A few types of porphyrias affect both the nervous system and the skin. Symptoms of porphyria vary, depending on the specific type of porphyria and how severe it is. Porphyria is usually inherited. One or both parents pass along a changed gene to their child. Although porphyria can't be cured, medicines and certain lifestyle changes may help you manage it. Treatment for symptoms depends on the type of porphyria you have. Symptoms can vary widely by type of porphyria and in how severe the symptoms are. Symptoms also can vary among people with the condition. Some people with a gene change that causes porphyria never have any symptoms. Acute porphyrias include forms of the disease that usually cause nervous system symptoms. A few forms also can affect the skin. Symptoms appear quickly and can be severe. Symptoms may last hours, days or weeks. The most common form of acute porphyria is called acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP may last hours or days. Intermittent means that the symptoms may go away but return later. When the symptoms occur they are sometimes called attacks. Symptoms of acute porphyrias may include: Cutaneous porphyrias include forms of the disease that cause skin symptoms as a result of sensitivity to sunlight. These forms usually don't affect the nervous system. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common type of all the porphyrias. Sun exposure may cause: Erythropoietic protoporphyria (uh-rith-roe-poi-ET-ik pro-toe-por-FEAR-e-uh), also called EPP, is a rare type of cutaneous porphyria. It's the most common childhood porphyria. Sun or artificial light exposure quickly results in painful skin burning, irritation and swelling. Small bumps and blisters also appear. Repeated exposures can cause thick, leathery skin and scarring. Many symptoms of porphyria are like those of other, more common conditions. This can make it difficult to know if you're having an attack of porphyria. If you have symptoms that could be porphyria, get medical attention. Prompt treatment is important. In an autosomal dominant disorder, the changed gene is a dominant gene. It's located on one of the nonsex chromosomes, called autosomes. Only one changed gene is needed for someone to be affected by this type of condition. A person with an autosomal dominant condition — in this example, the father — has a 50% chance of having an affected child with one changed gene and a 50% chance of having an unaffected child. In an autosomal dominant disorder, the changed gene is a dominant gene. It's located on one of the nonsex chromosomes, called autosomes. Only one changed gene is needed for someone to be affected by this type of condition. A person with an autosomal dominant condition — in this example, the father — has a 50% chance of having an affected child with one changed gene and a 50% chance of having an unaffected child. To have an autosomal recessive disorder, you inherit two changed genes, sometimes called mutations. You get one from each parent. Their health is rarely affected because they have only one changed gene. Two carriers have a 25% chance of having an unaffected child with two unaffected genes. They have a 50% chance of having an unaffected child who also is a carrier. They have a 25% chance of having an affected child with two changed genes. To have an autosomal recessive disorder, you inherit two changed genes, sometimes called mutations. You get one from each parent. Their health is rarely affected because they have only one changed gene. Two carriers have a 25% chance of having an unaffected child with two unaffected genes. They have a 50% chance of having an unaffected child who also is a carrier. They have a 25% chance of having an affected child with two changed genes. All types of porphyria involve a problem making heme. Heme is a part of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. Heme also plays a role in clearing drugs and hormones from the body. Heme is made in the bone marrow and liver. This process involves eight different enzymes that turn porphyrins into heme. A shortage or change in any of these enzymes causes a buildup of porphyrins. Which enzyme is affected determines the type of porphyria. In cutaneous porphyrias, porphyrins build up in the skin. When exposed to sunlight, they cause symptoms. In acute porphyrias, the buildup affects the nervous system, causing symptoms. Most forms of porphyria are caused by a gene change passed down from one or both parents. Porphyria can occur if you inherit: Just because you inherit a gene or genes that can cause porphyria doesn't mean that you'll have symptoms. You might never have symptoms. This also is the case for most carriers of the changed genes. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) usually is not passed down in families. In PCT, certain triggers can cause a buildup of porphyrins that may cause symptoms. Examples of triggers include: In addition to genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors may trigger symptoms in porphyria. When exposed to the trigger, the body's demand for heme production increases. This overwhelms the low level of a needed enzyme, setting in motion a process that causes a buildup of porphyrins. Examples of triggers include: Possible complications depend on the form of porphyria: In rare cases, a bone marrow transplant or liver transplant may be needed. Although there's no way to prevent porphyria, if you have the condition, avoid triggers to help prevent symptoms. Because porphyria is usually an inherited disorder, your siblings and other family members may want to consider genetic testing to determine if they have the condition. Genetic counseling is important to help understand test results and risks.

 Porphyria is a group of disorders in which substances called porphyrins build up in the body, adversely affecting the skin or nervous system.[1] The types that affect the nervous system are also known as acute porphyria, as symptoms are rapid in onset and short in duration.[1] Symptoms of an attack include abdominal pain, chest pain, vomiting, confusion, constipation, fever, high blood pressure, and high heart rate.[1][2][4] The attacks usually last for days to weeks.[2] Complications may include paralysis, low blood sodium levels, and seizures.[4] Attacks may be triggered by alcohol, smoking, hormonal changes, fasting, stress, or certain medications.[2][4] If the skin is affected, blisters or itching may occur with sunlight exposure.[2]
 Most types of porphyria are inherited from one or both of a person's parents and are due to a mutation in one of the genes that make heme.[2] They may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked dominant manner.[1] One type, porphyria cutanea tarda, may also be due to hemochromatosis (increased iron in the liver), hepatitis C, alcohol, or HIV/AIDS.[1] The underlying mechanism results in a decrease in the amount of heme produced and a build-up of substances involved in making heme.[1] Porphyrias may also be classified by whether the liver or bone marrow is affected.[1] Diagnosis is typically made by blood, urine, and stool tests.[2] Genetic testing may be done to determine the specific mutation.[2] Hepatic porphyrias are those in which the enzyme deficiency occurs in the liver. Hepatic porphyrias include acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), variegate porphyria (VP), aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ALAD), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and porphyria cutanea tarda.[5]
 Treatment depends on the type of porphyria and the person's symptoms.[2] Treatment of porphyria of the skin generally involves the avoidance of sunlight, while treatment for acute porphyria may involve giving intravenous heme or a glucose solution.[2] Rarely, a liver transplant may be carried out.[2]
 The precise prevalence of porphyria is unclear, but it is estimated to affect between 1 and 100 per 50,000 people.[1] Rates are different around the world.[2] Porphyria cutanea tarda is believed to be the most common type.[1] The disease was described as early as 370 BC by Hippocrates.[6] The underlying mechanism was first described by German physiologist and chemist Felix Hoppe-Seyler in 1871.[6] The name porphyria is from the Greek πορφύρα, porphyra, meaning ""purple"", a reference to the color of the urine that may be present during an attack.[6]
 Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), variegate porphyria (VP), aminolevulinic acid dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ALAD) and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). These diseases primarily affect the nervous system, resulting in episodic crises known as acute attacks. The major symptom of an acute attack is abdominal pain, often accompanied by vomiting, hypertension (elevated blood pressure), and tachycardia (an abnormally rapid heart rate).[4]
 The most severe episodes may involve neurological complications: typically motor neuropathy (severe dysfunction of the peripheral nerves that innervate muscle), which leads to muscle weakness and potentially to quadriplegia (paralysis of all four limbs) and central nervous system symptoms such as seizures and coma. Occasionally, there may be short-lived psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, and, very rarely, overt psychosis. All these symptoms resolve once the acute attack passes.[citation needed]
 Given the many presentations and the relatively low occurrence of porphyria, patients may initially be suspected to have other, unrelated conditions. For instance, the polyneuropathy of acute porphyria may be mistaken for Guillain–Barré syndrome, and porphyria testing is commonly recommended in those situations.[7] Elevation of aminolevulinic acid from lead-induced disruption of heme synthesis results in lead poisoning having symptoms similar to acute porphyria.[8][9][10][11][12][13]
 The non-acute porphyrias are X-linked dominant protoporphyria (XLDPP), congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), and erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). None of these are associated with acute attacks; their primary manifestation is with skin disease. For this reason, these four porphyrias—along with two acute porphyrias, VP and HCP, that may also involve skin manifestations—are sometimes called cutaneous porphyrias.
 Skin disease is encountered where excess porphyrins accumulate in the skin. Porphyrins are photoactive molecules, and exposure to light results in promotion of electrons to higher energy levels. When these return to the resting energy level or ground state, energy is released. This accounts for the property of fluorescence typical of the porphyrins. This causes local skin damage.
 Two distinct patterns of skin disease are seen in porphyria:
 The porphyrias are generally considered genetic in nature.[citation needed]
 Subtypes of porphyrias depend on which enzyme is deficient.
 X-linked dominant protoporphyria is a rare form of erythropoietic protoporphyria caused by a gain-of-function mutation in ALAS2 characterized by severe photosensitivity.[22][23]
 In the autosomal recessive types, if a person inherits a single gene they may become a carrier. Generally they do not have symptoms, but may pass the gene onto offspring.[24]
 Acute porphyria can be triggered by a number of drugs, most of which are believed to trigger it by interacting with enzymes in the liver which are made with heme. Such drugs include:[25][26][27]
 In humans, porphyrins are the main precursors of heme, an essential constituent of hemoglobin, myoglobin, catalase, peroxidase, and P450 liver cytochromes.[28]
 The body requires porphyrins to produce heme, which is used to carry oxygen in the blood among other things, but in the porphyrias there is a deficiency (inherited or acquired) of the enzymes that transform the various porphyrins into others, leading to abnormally high levels of one or more of these substances. Porphyrias are classified in two ways, by symptoms and by pathophysiology. Physiologically, porphyrias are classified as liver or erythropoietic based on the sites of accumulation of heme precursors, either in the liver or in the bone marrow and red blood cells.[29]
 Deficiency in the enzymes of the porphyrin pathway leads to insufficient production of heme. Heme function plays a central role in cellular metabolism. This is not the main problem in the porphyrias; most heme synthesis enzymes—even dysfunctional enzymes—have enough residual activity to assist in heme biosynthesis. The principal problem in these deficiencies is the accumulation of porphyrins, the heme precursors, which are toxic to tissue in high concentrations. The chemical properties of these intermediates determine the location of accumulation, whether they induce photosensitivity, and whether the intermediate is excreted (in the urine or feces).[citation needed]
 There are eight enzymes in the heme biosynthetic pathway, four of which—the first one and the last three—are in the mitochondria, while the other four are in the cytosol. Defects in any of these can lead to some form of porphyria. The hepatic porphyrias are characterized by acute neurological attacks (seizures, psychosis, extreme back and abdominal pain, and an acute polyneuropathy), while the erythropoietic forms present with skin problems, usually a light-sensitive blistering rash and increased hair growth. Variegate porphyria (also porphyria variegata or mixed porphyria), which results from a partial deficiency in PROTO oxidase, manifests itself with skin lesions similar to those of porphyria cutanea tarda combined with acute neurologic attacks. Hereditary coproporphyria, which is characterized by a deficiency in coproporphyrinogen oxidase, coded for by the CPOX gene, may also present with both acute neurologic attacks and cutaneous lesions. All other porphyrias are either skin- or nerve-predominant.[30]
 Porphyria is diagnosed through biochemical analysis of blood, urine, and stool.[17][31] In general, urine estimation of porphobilinogen (PBG) is the first step if acute porphyria is suspected. As a result of feedback, the decreased production of heme leads to increased production of precursors, PBG being one of the first substances in the porphyrin synthesis pathway.[32] In nearly all cases of acute porphyria syndromes, urinary PBG is markedly elevated except for the very rare ALA dehydratase deficiency or in patients with symptoms due to hereditary tyrosinemia type I.[33] In cases of
mercury- or arsenic poisoning-induced porphyria, other changes in porphyrin profiles appear, most notably elevations of uroporphyrins I & III, coproporphyrins I & III, and pre-coproporphyrin.[34]
 As most porphyrias are rare conditions, general hospital labs typically do not have the expertise, technology, or staff time to perform porphyria testing. In general, testing involves sending samples of blood, stool, and urine to a reference laboratory.[17] All samples to detect porphyrins must be handled properly. Samples should be taken during an acute attack; otherwise a false negative result may occur. Samples must be protected from light and either refrigerated or preserved.[17]
 If all the porphyrin studies are negative, one must consider pseudoporphyria. A careful medication review often will find the cause of pseudoporphyria.[citation needed]
 Further diagnostic tests of affected organs may be required, such as nerve conduction studies for neuropathy or an ultrasound of the liver. Basic biochemical tests may assist in identifying liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and other organ problems.[35]
 •Other Diagnosis
 Clinical Evaluation: A thorough medical history and physical examination focusing on symptoms related to photosensitivity, skin lesions, abdominal pain, and neurological manifestations.
 Genetic Testing: Molecular genetic testing to identify specific gene mutations associated with congenital porphyrias.
 Other Tests: Liver function tests, iron studies, and imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI may be conducted to evaluate liver and spleen involvement.
 Often, empirical treatment is required if the diagnostic suspicion of a porphyria is high since acute attacks can be fatal. A high-carbohydrate diet is typically recommended; in severe attacks, a dextrose 10% infusion is commenced, which may aid in recovery by suppressing heme synthesis, which in turn reduces the rate of porphyrin accumulation.  However, this can worsen cases of low blood sodium levels (hyponatraemia) and should be done with extreme caution as it can prove fatal.[36]
 Hematin (trade name Panhematin) and heme arginate (trade name NormoSang) are the drugs of choice in acute porphyria, in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. These drugs need to be given very early in an attack to be effective; effectiveness varies amongst individuals. They are not curative drugs but can shorten attacks and reduce the intensity of an attack. Side effects are rare but can be serious. These heme-like substances theoretically inhibit ALA synthase and hence the accumulation of toxic precursors. In the United Kingdom, supplies of NormoSang are kept at two national centers; emergency supply is available from St Thomas's Hospital, London.[37] In the United States, Lundbeck manufactures and supplies Panhematin for infusion.[38]
 Heme arginate (NormoSang) is used during crises but also in preventive treatment to avoid crises, one treatment every 10 days.[citation needed]
 Any sign of low blood sodium (hyponatremia) or weakness should be treated with the addition of hematin, heme arginate, or even tin mesoporphyrin, as these are signs of impending syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or peripheral nervous system involvement that may be localized or severe, progressing to bulbar paresis and respiratory paralysis.[citation needed]
 Cimetidine has also been reported to be effective for acute porphyric crisis and possibly effective for long-term prophylaxis.[39]
 Pain is severe, frequently out of proportion to physical signs, and often requires the use of opiates to reduce it to tolerable levels. Pain should be treated as early as medically possible. Nausea can be severe; it may respond to phenothiazine drugs but is sometimes intractable. Hot baths and showers may lessen nausea temporarily, though caution should be used to avoid burns or falls.[citation needed]
 It is recommended that patients with a history of acute porphyria, and even genetic carriers, wear an alert bracelet or other identification at all times. This is in case they develop severe symptoms, or in case of accidents where there is a potential for drug exposure, and as a result they are unable to explain their condition to healthcare professionals. Some drugs are absolutely contraindicated for patients with any form of porphyria.[40]
 Patients who experience frequent attacks can develop chronic neuropathic pain in extremities as well as chronic pain in the abdomen.[41] Intestinal pseudo-obstruction, ileus, intussusception, hypoganglionosis, and encopresis in children have been associated with porphyrias. This is thought to be due to axonal nerve deterioration in affected areas of the nervous system and vagal nerve dysfunction. Pain treatment with long-acting opioids, such as morphine, is often indicated, and, in cases where seizure or neuropathy is present, gabapentin is known to improve outcome.[42]
 Seizures often accompany this disease. Most seizure medications exacerbate this condition. Treatment can be problematic: barbiturates especially must be avoided. Some benzodiazepines are safe and, when used in conjunction with newer anti-seizure medications such as gabapentin, offer a possible regimen for seizure control. Gabapentin has the additional feature of aiding in the treatment of some kinds of neuropathic pain.[42] Magnesium sulfate and bromides have also been used in porphyria seizures; however, development of status epilepticus in porphyria may not respond to magnesium alone. The addition of hematin or heme arginate has been used during status epilepticus.[43]
 Depression often accompanies the disease and is best dealt with by treating the offending symptoms and if needed the judicious use of antidepressants. Some psychotropic drugs are porphyrinogenic, limiting the therapeutic scope. Other psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, depression, mania, hallucinations, delusions, confusion, catatonia, and psychosis may occur.[44]
 Some liver diseases may cause porphyria even in the absence of genetic predisposition. These include hemochromatosis and hepatitis C. Treatment of iron overload may be required.[2]
 Patients with the acute porphyrias (AIP, HCP, VP) are at increased risk over their life for hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) and may require monitoring. Other typical risk factors for liver cancer need not be present.[2]
 Hormonal fluctuations that contribute to cyclical attacks in women have been treated with oral contraceptives and luteinizing hormones to shut down menstrual cycles. However, oral contraceptives have also triggered photosensitivity and withdrawal of oral contraceptives has triggered attacks. Androgens and fertility hormones have also triggered attacks.[45] In 2019, givosiran was approved in the United States for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria.[46][47]
 These are associated with accumulation of porphyrins in erythrocytes and are rare.
 The pain, burning, swelling, and itching that occur in erythropoietic porphyrias (EP) generally require avoidance of bright sunlight. Most kinds of sunscreen are not effective, but SPF-rated long-sleeve shirts, hats, bandanas, and gloves can help. Chloroquine may be used to increase porphyrin secretion in some EPs.[17] Blood transfusion is occasionally used to suppress innate heme production.[citation needed]
 The rarest is congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), otherwise known as Gunther's disease. The signs may present from birth and include severe photosensitivity, brown teeth that fluoresce in ultraviolet light due to deposition of Type 1 porphyrins, and later hypertrichosis. Hemolytic anemia usually develops. Pharmaceutical-grade beta carotene may be used in its treatment.[48] A bone marrow transplant has also been successful in curing CEP in a few cases, although long-term results are not yet available.[49]
 In December 2014, afamelanotide received authorization from the European Commission as a treatment for the prevention of phototoxicity in adult patients with EPP.[50] In a 2023 industry-funded phase 2 trial, dersimelagon, an orally administered, selective melanocortin 1 receptor agonist that increases levels of skin eumelanin, was reported to have increased the duration of symptom-free sunlight exposure and quality of life compared to placebo in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria.[51]
 Rates of all types of porphyria taken together have been estimated to be approximately one in 25,000 in the United States.[52] The worldwide prevalence has been estimated to be between one in 500 and one in 50,000 people.[53]
 Porphyrias have been detected in all races and in multiple ethnic groups on every continent. There are high incidence reports of AIP in areas of India and Scandinavia. More than 200 genetic variants of AIP are known, some of which are specific to families, although some strains have proven to be repeated mutations.[citation needed]
 The epidemiology of congenital porphyrias varies depending on the specific type of porphyria. Here's a general overview:
 1. Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP): EPP is relatively rare, with an estimated prevalence of 1 to 9 cases per 100,000 individuals worldwide. It affects both males and females, typically presenting in childhood or early adulthood.
 2. Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria (CEP): CEP is extremely rare, with fewer than 200 cases reported worldwide. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning both parents must carry a mutated gene for a child to develop the condition. CEP occurs with higher frequency in certain populations, including individuals of Northern European descent.
 3. Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT): PCT is the most common form of porphyria, with an estimated prevalence of 1 to 2 cases per 10,000 individuals in the general population. It predominantly affects adults, with a higher prevalence in men than in women. PCT can be sporadic or familial and is often associated with underlying liver disease, alcohol abuse, hepatitis C infection, or certain medications.
 These prevalence estimates may vary across different regions and populations, and the actual prevalence of congenital porphyrias may be underreported due to challenges in diagnosis and awareness. Additionally, advances in genetic testing and increased awareness of porphyria may lead to more accurate epidemiological data in the future.
 The underlying mechanism was first described by the German physiologist Felix Hoppe-Seyler in 1871,[54] and acute porphyrias were described by the Dutch physician Barend Stokvis in 1889.[55][56]
 The links between porphyrias and mental illness have been noted for decades. In the early 1950s, patients with porphyrias (occasionally referred to as ""porphyric hemophilia""[57]) and severe symptoms of depression or catatonia were treated with electroshock therapy.
 Porphyria has been suggested as an explanation for the origin of vampire and werewolf legends, based upon certain perceived similarities between the condition and the folklore.
 In January 1964, L. Illis's 1963 paper, ""On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves,"" was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine. Later, Nancy Garden argued for a connection between porphyria and the vampire belief in her 1973 book, Vampires. In 1985, biochemist David Dolphin's paper for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, ""Porphyria, Vampires, and Werewolves: The Aetiology of European Metamorphosis Legends,"" gained widespread media coverage, popularizing the idea.[citation needed]
 The theory has been rejected by a few folklorists and researchers as not accurately describing the characteristics of the original werewolf and vampire legends or the disease, and as potentially stigmatizing people with porphyria.[58][59]
 A 1995 article from the Postgraduate Medical Journal (via NIH) explains:
 As it was believed that the folkloric vampire could move about freely in daylight hours, as opposed to the 20th century variant, congenital erythropoietic porphyria cannot readily explain the folkloric vampire but may be an explanation of the vampire as we know it in the 20th century. In addition, the folkloric vampire, when unearthed, was always described as looking quite healthy (""as they were in life""), while due to disfiguring aspects of the disease, sufferers would not have passed the exhumation test. Individuals with congenital erythropoietic porphyria do not crave blood. The enzyme (hematin) necessary to alleviate symptoms is not absorbed intact on oral ingestion, and drinking blood would have no beneficial effect on the sufferer. Finally, and most important, the fact that vampire reports were literally rampant in the 18th century, and that congenital erythropoietic porphyria is an extremely rare manifestation of a rare disease, makes it an unlikely explanation of the folkloric vampire.[60] Stated or implied references to porphyria are included in some literature, particularly gothic literature. These include the following:

"Treatment for porphyria depends on the type of porphyria you have and your symptoms. For people living with cutaneous porphyrias, avoiding sunlight is key to recovery. The term porphyria describes a group of eight disorders that affect the skin and nervous system. Most of these disorders are inherited (passed down from family members). One type of porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), isn’t always inherited. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Porphyria is rare. Doctors don’t know the exact number of people living with this condition, because many have no symptoms of the disease. However, it has been estimated that all forms of porphyria combined affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Each type of porphyria is caused by low levels of a specific enzyme (a specific enzyme [chemical] for each type of porphyria) that is needed during the making of heme. Heme is an iron-containing pigment that is vital for all the body’s organs. Heme is part of the hemoglobin in your blood. Hemoglobin carries oxygen to body tissues and gives red blood cells their color. Heme is also part of proteins in the liver that help the liver function properly. In the several-step process of making heme, several other compounds – called porphyrins and porphyrin precursors – are created. If there is a low level of any one of the enzymes needed to make heme, these porphyrin and porphyrin precursors build up in the liver, skin, and other body tissues. When they build up, people may develop symptoms of one of the types of porphyria. Advertisement The specific names of the eight types of porphyrias are: Doctors classify porphyrias in several different ways. Besides defining by each specific type, doctors also classify porphyria in two broad categories: Doctors also classify porphyria by which body system becomes overactive: The symptoms of porphyria vary depending on type. Symptoms range from mild to severe. Some people with porphyria have no symptoms. In some cases, symptoms can be life-threatening unless treated. People living with cutaneous types of porphyria, which affects the skin, often experience symptoms including: Acute porphyrias can cause symptoms that affect the nervous system. These symptoms generally occur suddenly and usually last a short period of time. Symptoms of acute porphyrias include: Advertisement Porphyria most often results from genetic mutations passed down from parent to child. You are more at risk for porphyria if a parent has the disorder. Unlike the other types of porphyrias, porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) occurs when an inactive acquired disease, like hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), becomes active in the body. The disease’s activity causes a deficiency in the enzymes needed to produce heme. Factors that can trigger PCT include: Symptoms of other types of porphyria can be triggered by: Diagnosis can be difficult because symptoms of the porphyrias can resemble the symptoms of many other diseases. If doctors suspect you have porphyria, blood and urine tests screen for porphyrins and other porphyrin precursors. Feces (stool) tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Doctors also diagnose porphyria using genetic testing of a blood sample. This type of test is very accurate. Doctors often use it if family members are known to have porphyria. Treatment for porphyria depends on the type of porphyria you have and your symptoms. For people living with cutaneous porphyrias, avoiding sunlight is key to recovery. Your doctor may also recommend that you avoid substances, like alcohol, that trigger symptoms. Some people with cutaneous porphyria benefit from therapeutic phlebotomy (blood draw). This type of blood draw reduces the amount of iron in the liver. Treatment for acute porphyria involves intravenous (IV) heme or glucose infusions (adding heme or glucose directly into a vein). These therapies decrease the number of porphyrins or porphyrin precursors produced in the liver. Other drugs are under investigation and may be available through clinical trials. Ask your doctor if a clinical trial is something to consider for your specific type of porphyria. Dietary changes, including eating high amounts of carbohydrates and calorie-rich foods, also help manage symptoms. Patients with acute porphyria who have severe symptoms or who have other types of porphyria may require more invasive treatments to manage symptoms. Treatment options may include blood transfusions, surgery to remove the spleen, and liver and bone marrow transplantation. For some people, erythropoietic porphyria leads to liver failure. If this occurs, a liver transplant can be a life-saving treatment. Some types of acute porphyrias cause muscle weakness. Muscle problems can be life-threatening if weakness affects the muscles that make respiration (breathing) possible. Hospitalization is required if porphyria affects the respiratory muscles. Because genetic mutations cause most types of porphyria, the disorder can’t be prevented. However, you can avoid triggers that may cause symptoms. These triggers include smoking, alcohol consumption, and exposure to sunlight. Drugs that may need to be avoided include barbiturates, tranquilizers, birth control pills, and sedatives. Most people with porphyria recover from their symptoms. Because genetic mutations cause this condition, you may experience symptoms throughout your life. If you develop any symptoms of porphyria, or if your symptoms get worse, contact your doctor immediately. They can find the cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan tailored to your individual needs. Last reviewed on 02/15/2018. Learn more about our editorial process.

"Porphyrias are a group of rare inherited blood disorders. People with these disorders have problems making a substance called heme in their bodies. Heme is made of body chemicals called porphyrin, which are bound to iron. Heme is a component of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. It helps red blood cells carry oxygen and gives them their red color.  Heme is also found in myoglobin, a protein in the heart and skeletal muscles. The body goes through several steps to make heme. In people with porphyria, the body lacks certain enzymes needed to complete this process.  This causes porphyrin to accumulate in tissues and blood, which may cause a variety of symptoms, ranging from mild to severe.  The most common symptoms of porphyria are: The symptoms of porphyria vary and depend on which enzyme is missing. There are several types of porphyria, which are classified into two categories:  Hepatic forms of the disorder are caused by problems in the liver. They’re associated with symptoms such as abdominal pain and problems with the central nervous system.  Erythropoietic forms are caused by problems in red blood cells. They’re associated with light sensitivity. ALAD porphyria (ADP) is a deficiency of the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and is one of the more severe and rare forms of porphyria. Only about 10 cases have been reported worldwide, and all have been in males.  Symptoms present as an acute attack, often as severe abdominal cramping with vomiting and constipation. Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a deficiency of the enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS). Many with an HMBS gene mutation don’t show symptoms unless triggered by one or more of the following:  Women going through puberty are especially likely to have symptoms. These may include: Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX).  Similar to AIP, symptoms may not occur unless triggered by behavioral, environmental, or hormonal changes. Both men and women are affected equally, though women are more likely to experience symptoms. Attacks can include symptoms such as: Symptoms can vary greatly including skin symptoms, neurological symptoms, or both. Sun sensitivity including blistering skin is the most common skin symptom of Variegate porphyria (VP).  Acute attacks of VP often begin with abdominal pain. VP is more common in South Africa in people of Dutch ancestry with up to 3 in 1,000 people in the white population affected. Reports suggest that women are more likely to carry the gene mutation. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) results from the deficient function of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen lll cosynthase (UROS).  The most common symptom is hypersensitivity of the skin to sunlight and some forms of artificial light. Blistering and lesions can often occur from exposure. CEP is a very rare disorder with just over 200 cases having been reported worldwide. According to the American Porphyria Foundation, Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common type of porphyria. It’s associated with extreme sensitivity to sunlight and painful, blistering lesions on the skin. PCT is mostly an acquired disease, but some people have a genetic deficiency of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) that contributes to the development of PCT. Men and women can both be affected, but PCT is most common in women over age 30. Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP) is the autosomal recessive form of familial porphyria vutanea tarda (f-PCT) and presents with similar symptoms.  Skin sensitivity to light often leads to severe blistering, sometimes with mutilation or loss of fingers or facial features. Skin symptoms usually begin in infancy. People may also experience hair growth (hypertrichosis), brown- or red-colored teeth (erythrodontia), and red- or purple-colored urine.  HEP is very rare, with only about 40 cases reported worldwide. Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is an inherited metabolic disorder causing skin hypersensitivity to light. The skin often becomes itchy and red after exposure and a burning sensation can occur. Onset usually begins in infancy and is the most common porphyria in children. Though both men and women can experience EPP symptoms, it’s often more servere in men. Symptoms depend on the type of porphyria. Severe abdominal pain is present in all types, as well as urine that’s reddish-brown in color. This is caused by the buildup of porphyrins and typically occurs after an attack. Symptoms associated with hepatic disease include: Symptoms associated with erythropoietic disease include: There’s no cure for porphyria. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms. Most cases are treated with medication. Treatments for hepatic disease include: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved givosiran in November 2019 for the treatment of adults with acute hepatic porphyria. The treatment was determined to have decreased the rate at which the liver produces toxic byproducts, leading to less attacks. Treatments for erythropoietic disease include: Porphyria is a genetic disease. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), most types of porphyria are inherited from an abnormal gene, called a gene mutation, from one parent.  However, certain factors may trigger symptoms of porphyria, known as attacks. Factors include: Many tests can help diagnose this condition.  Tests that look for physical problems include: Tests for blood problems include: Porphyria is incurable and difficult to manage. Complications are common. They include: Porphyria cannot be prevented. However, symptoms can be reduced by avoiding or eliminating triggers. Factors that should be eliminated include: Preventing erythropoietic symptoms focuses on reducing light exposure by: Long-term outlook varies widely, but treatments are being investigated every day. If you manage your symptoms and avoid triggers, you can carry out your everyday activities with few issues. Getting a treatment plan in place early can help prevent permanent damage. Long-term damage can include: Early diagnosis can help you lead a relatively normal life. Management is also very important. If you have an inherited condition, talk to a genetic counselor.

 Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the blood vessels that supply the lungs (pulmonary arteries). It's a serious condition that can damage the right side of the heart. The walls of the pulmonary arteries become thick and stiff, and cannot expand as well to allow blood through. The reduced blood flow makes it harder for the right side of the heart to pump blood through the arteries. If the right side of your heart has to continually work harder, it can gradually become weaker. This can lead to heart failure. Pulmonary hypertension is a rare condition that can affect people of all ages, but it's more common in people who have another heart or lung condition. Symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include: The symptoms often get worse during exercise, which can limit your ability to take part in physical activities. If you have a type of pulmonary hypertension known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), you may not have any symptoms until the condition is quite advanced. See a GP if you have any symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. They may ask you about your symptoms and medical history, and they may carry out a physical examination. Call 999 or go to A&E if you get sudden chest pain that does not stop after a few minutes, or you have heart palpitations with chest pain, shortness of breath or feeling faint. These could be a sign of another condition such as a blood clot in your lungs or a serious heart problem. Correctly diagnosing pulmonary hypertension can sometimes take time because its symptoms are similar to those of many other heart and lung conditions. Tests you may have include a type of heart scan called an echocardiogram, and right heart catheterisation, where a thin, flexible tube is inserted into your pulmonary artery. Read more about how pulmonary hypertension is diagnosed. The changes in the pulmonary arteries that lead to pulmonary hypertension can be caused by: Read more about the causes of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension cannot be cured, but treatment can reduce the symptoms and help you manage your condition.  Pulmonary hypertension usually gets worse over time. Left untreated, it may cause heart failure, which can be fatal, so it's important treatment is started as soon as possible. If another condition is causing pulmonary hypertension, the underlying condition should be treated first. This can sometimes prevent the pulmonary arteries being permanently damaged. Treatments for pulmonary hypertension may include anticoagulant medicines to reduce the blood's ability to thicken (clot) and diuretics to remove excess fluid as a result of heart failure. You may also be offered medicine to widen the blood vessels. Home oxygen therapy may also be prescribed if the level of oxygen in your blood is low. Read more about treating pulmonary hypertension. The outlook for pulmonary hypertension varies, depending on factors such as: The specialist in charge of your care will be able to give you more detailed information. Having pulmonary hypertension can affect your ability to carry out everyday activities. The charity Pulmonary Hypertension Association UK offers practical information and support for people living with pulmonary hypertension and their friends and families.

"Pulmonary hypertension (PH or PHTN) is a condition of increased blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs.[7] Symptoms include shortness of breath, fainting, tiredness, chest pain, swelling of the legs, and a fast heartbeat.[7][2] The condition may make it difficult to exercise.[7] Onset is typically gradual.[8]
According to the definition at the 6th World Symposium of Pulmonary Hypertension in 2018, a patient is deemed to have pulmonary hypertension if the pulmonary mean arterial pressure is greater than 20mmHg at rest, revised down from a purely arbitrary 25mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) greater than 3 Wood units.
 The cause is often unknown.[1] Risk factors include a family history, prior pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs), HIV/AIDS, sickle cell disease, cocaine use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea, living at high altitudes, and problems with the mitral valve.[5][4] The underlying mechanism typically involves inflammation and subsequent remodeling of the arteries in the lungs.[5] Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes.[1]
 As of 2022[update] there was no cure for pulmonary hypertension,[6] although research to find a cure is ongoing. Treatment depends on the type of disease.[6] A number of supportive measures such as oxygen therapy, diuretics, and medications to inhibit blood clotting may be used.[1] Medications specifically used to treat pulmonary hypertension include epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost, bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan, and sildenafil, tadalafil, selexipag, riociguat.[1] Lung transplantation may be an option in severe cases.[6]
 The frequency of occurrence is estimated at 1,000 new cases per year in the United States.[4][2] Females are more often affected than males.[2] Onset is typically between 20 and 60 years of age.[4] Pulmonary hypertension was identified by Ernst von Romberg in 1891.[9][1]
 According to WHO classification there are 5 groups of PH, where Group I (pulmonary arterial hypertension) is further subdivided into Group I' and Group I'' classes.[10][11] The WHO classification system in 2022 (with adaptations from the more recent ESC/ERS guidelines shown in italics) can be summarized as follows:[11][12]
 WHO Group I – Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
 WHO Group I' – Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD), pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH)
 WHO Group I"" – Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn
 WHO Group II – Pulmonary hypertension secondary to left heart disease
 WHO Group III – Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease, chronic hypoxia
 WHO Group IV – chronic arterial obstruction
 WHO Group V – Pulmonary hypertension with unclear or multifactorial mechanisms
 The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include the following:[3][12][15]
 Less common signs/symptoms include non-productive cough and exercise-induced nausea and vomiting.[12] Coughing up of blood may occur in some patients, particularly those with specific subtypes of pulmonary hypertension such as heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension, Eisenmenger syndrome and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.[16] Pulmonary venous hypertension typically presents with shortness of breath while lying flat or sleeping (orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), while pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) typically does not.[17]
 Other typical signs of pulmonary hypertension include an accentuated pulmonary component of the second heart sound, a right ventricular third heart sound, and parasternal heave indicating a hypertrophied right ventricle. Signs of systemic congestion resulting from right-sided heart failure include jugular venous distension, ascites, and hepatojugular reflux.[12][15][18] Evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and pulmonic regurgitation is also sought and, if present, is consistent with the presence of pulmonary hypertension.[12][15][19]
 Pulmonary hypertension is a pathophysiologic condition with many possible causes. Indeed, this condition frequently accompanies severe heart or lung conditions.[12] A 1973 World Health Organization meeting was the first attempt to classify pulmonary hypertension by its cause, and a distinction was made between primary PH (resulting from a disease of the pulmonary arteries) and secondary PH (resulting secondary to other, non-vascular causes). Further, primary PH was divided into the ""arterial plexiform"", ""veno-occlusive"" and ""thromboembolic"" forms.[20] In 1998, a second conference at Évian-les-Bains addressed the causes of secondary PH.[21] Subsequent third,[22] fourth,[10] and fifth (2013)[11] World Symposia on PAH have further defined the classification of PH.  The classification continues to evolve based on improved understanding of the disease mechanisms.[citation needed]
 Most recently in 2015, the WHO guidelines were updated by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Respiratory Society (ERS).[12] These guidelines are endorsed by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, and provide the current framework for understanding and treatment of pulmonary hypertension.[23]
 Mutations in several genes have been associated with this condition[24][25] these include bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (EIF2AK4). 80% of familial pulmonary arterial hypertension and 20% of sporadic variants have mutations in BMPR2.[26] BMPR2 is involved in endothelial proliferation and remodeling. Other mutations associated with PAH include ACVRL1 (which encodes activin receptor–like kinase 1) and ENG encoding endoglin, two proteins which also participate in BMPR2 signaling.[26] The SMAD transcription factor family, including SMAD1, SMAD4, and SMAD9 are involved in signaling pathways downstream from BMPR2 and are also implicated in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension.[26]
 The pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I) involves the narrowing of blood vessels connected to and within the lungs. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood through the lungs, as it is much harder to make water flow through a narrow pipe as opposed to a wide one. Over time, the affected blood vessels become stiffer and thicker, in a process known as fibrosis. The mechanisms involved in this narrowing process include vasoconstriction, thrombosis, and vascular remodeling (excessive cellular proliferation, fibrosis, and reduced apoptosis/programmed cell death in the vessel walls, caused by inflammation, disordered metabolism and dysregulation of certain growth factors).[27][28] This further increases the blood pressure within the lungs and impairs their blood flow. In common with other types of pulmonary hypertension, these changes result in an increased workload for the right side of the heart.[15][29] The right ventricle is normally part of a low pressure system, with systolic ventricular pressures that are lower than those that the left ventricle normally encounters. As such, the right ventricle cannot cope as well with higher pressures, and although right ventricular adaptations (hypertrophy and increased contractility of the heart muscle) initially help to preserve stroke volume, ultimately these compensatory mechanisms are insufficient; the right ventricular muscle cannot get enough oxygen to meet its needs and right heart failure follows.[15][28][29] As the blood flowing through the lungs decreases, the left side of the heart receives less blood. This blood may also carry less oxygen than normal. Therefore, it becomes harder and harder for the left side of the heart to supply sufficient oxygen to the rest of the body, especially during physical activity.[30][31][10] During the end-systolic volume phase of the cardiac cycle, the Gaussian curvature and the mean curvature of right ventricular endocardial wall of PH patients was found to be significantly different as compared to controls.[32]
 In PVOD (WHO Group I'), pulmonary blood vessel narrowing occurs preferentially (though not exclusively) in post-capillary venous blood vessels.[33] PVOD shares several characteristics with PAH, but there are also some important differences, for example differences in prognosis and response to medical therapy.[citation needed]
 Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn occurs when the circulatory system of a newborn baby fails to adapt to life outside the womb; it is characterized by high resistance to blood flow through the lungs, right-to-left cardiac shunting and severe hypoxemia.[15]
 Pathogenesis in pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (WHO Group II) is completely different in that constriction or damage to the pulmonary blood vessels is not the issue. Instead, the left heart fails to pump blood efficiently, leading to pooling of blood in the lungs and back pressure within the pulmonary system. This causes pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.[34] In the absence of pulmonary blood vessel narrowing, the increased back pressure is described as 'isolated post-capillary pulmonary hypertension' (older terms include 'passive' or 'proportionate' pulmonary hypertension or 'pulmonary venous hypertension'). However, in some patients, the raised pressure in the pulmonary vessels triggers a superimposed component of vessel narrowing, which further increases the workload of the right side of the heart. This is referred to as 'post-capillary pulmonary hypertension with a pre-capillary component' or 'combined post-capillary and pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension' (older terms include 'reactive' or 'out-of-proportion' pulmonary hypertension).[12][17][35]
 In pulmonary hypertension due to lung diseases and/or hypoxia (WHO Group III), low levels of oxygen in the alveoli (due to respiratory disease or living at high altitude) cause constriction of the pulmonary arteries. This phenomenon is called hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and it is initially a protective response to stop too much blood flowing to areas of the lung that are damaged and do not contain oxygen. When the alveolar hypoxia is widespread and prolonged, this hypoxia-mediated vasoconstriction occurs across a large portion of the pulmonary vascular bed and leads to an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure, with thickening of the pulmonary vessel walls contributing to the development of sustained pulmonary hypertension.[10][36][37][38]  Prolonged hypoxia also induces the transcription factor HIF1A, which directly activates downstream growth factor signaling that causes irreversible proliferation and remodeling of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, leading to chronic pulmonary arterial hypertension.[citation needed]
 In chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, or CTEPH (WHO Group IV), the initiating event is thought to be blockage or narrowing of the pulmonary blood vessels with unresolved blood clots; these clots can lead to increased pressure and shear stress in the rest of the pulmonary circulation, precipitating structural changes in the vessel walls (remodeling) similar to those observed in other types of severe pulmonary hypertension. This combination of vessel occlusion and vascular remodeling once again increases the resistance to blood flow and so the pressure within the system rises.[39][40]
 The molecular mechanism of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is not known yet, but it is believed that the endothelial dysfunction results in a decrease in the synthesis of endothelium-derived vasodilators such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin.[41] Moreover, there is a stimulation of the synthesis of vasoconstrictors such as thromboxane and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These result in a severe vasoconstriction and vascular smooth muscle  and adventitial hypertrophy characteristic of patients with PAH.[41]
 In normal conditions, the vascular endothelial nitric oxide synthase produces nitric oxide from L-arginine in the presence of oxygen.[42]
 This nitric oxide diffuses into neighboring cells (including vascular smooth muscle cells and platelets), where it increases the activity of the enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase, leading to increased formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP).[43] The cGMP then activates cGMP-dependent kinase or PKG (protein kinase G). Activated PKG promotes vasorelaxation (via a reduction of intracellular calcium levels), alters the expression of genes involved in smooth muscle cell contraction, migration and differentiation, and inhibits platelet activation.[44] Nitric oxide–soluble guanylate cyclase signaling also leads to anti-inflammatory effects.[45]
 Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is abundant in the pulmonary tissue, hydrolyzes the cyclic bond of cGMP. Consequently, the concentration of cGMP (and thus PKG activity) decreases.[46][44]
 Endothelin-1 is a peptide (comprising 21 amino acids) that is produced in endothelial cells. It acts on the endothelin receptors ETA and ETB in various cell types including vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, leading to vasoconstriction, hypertrophy, proliferation, inflammation, and fibrosis. It also acts on ETB receptors in endothelial cells; this leads to the release of both vasoconstrictors and vasodilators from those cells, and clears endothelin-1 from the system.[47][48]
 Prostacyclin is synthesized from arachidonic acid in endothelial cells. In vascular smooth muscle cells, prostacyclin binds mainly to the prostaglandin I receptor. This sends a signal to increase adenylate cyclase activity, which leads to increased synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This in turn leads to increased cAMP-dependent protein kinase or PKA (protein kinase A) activity, ultimately promoting vasodilation and inhibiting cell proliferation. Prostacyclin signaling also leads to anti-thrombotic, anti-fibrotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Levels of cAMP (which mediates most of the biological effects of prostacyclin) are reduced by phosphodiesterases 3 and 4.[49][50]
The vasoconstrictor thromboxane is also synthesized from arachidonic acid. In PAH, the balance is shifted away from synthesis of prostacyclin toward synthesis of thromboxane.[49]
 The three pathways described above are all targeted by currently available medical therapies for PAH. However, several other pathways have been identified that are also altered in PAH and are being investigated as potential targets for future therapies. For example, the mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) is pathologically activated in PAH, causing a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis and leading to increased cell proliferation and impaired apoptosis.[49][51]  Expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide, a potent vasodilator with anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory roles, is reduced in PAH, while expression of its receptor is increased.[49][51]
Plasma levels of serotonin, which promotes vasoconstriction, hypertrophy and proliferation, are increased in patients with PAH, although the role played by serotonin in the pathogenesis of PAH remains uncertain.[15][49] The expression or activity of several growth factors (including platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor) is increased and contributes to vascular remodeling in PAH.[49] Other factors underlying the proliferative state of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells include OPG[52] and TRAIL.[53] Focusing only on the pulmonary vasculature provides an incomplete picture of PAH; the ability of the right ventricle to adapt to the increased workload varies between patients and is an important determinant of survival. The molecular pathology of PAH in the right ventricle is therefore also being investigated, and recent research has shifted to consider the cardiopulmonary unit as a single system rather than two separate systems. Importantly, right ventricular remodeling is associated with increased apoptosis; this is in contrast to pulmonary vascular remodeling which involves inhibition of apoptosis.[28]
 Even though the primary cause of PAH is unknown, inflammation and oxidative stress have been shown to have a key role in vascular remodeling.[54]  These factors are known to cause DNA damage, and may also promote the proliferative and apoptosis-resistant phenotype that is observed in PAH vascular cells.[54] Elevated levels of DNA damage have been reported to occur in PAH lungs and remodeled arteries, and also in animal models of PH, indicating that DNA damage likely contributes to PAH pathogenesis.[54]
 In terms of the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, it has five major types, and a series of tests must be performed to distinguish pulmonary arterial hypertension from venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or unclear multifactorial varieties. PAH is diagnosed after exclusion of other possible causes of pulmonary hypertension.[15]
 A physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension (described above),[55] and a detailed family history is established to determine whether the disease might be heritable.[56][57][58] A history of exposure to drugs such as benfluorex (a fenfluramine derivative), dasatinib, cocaine, methamphetamine, ethanol leading to cirrhosis, and tobacco leading to emphysema is considered significant.[15][59][11] Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) is associated with an increased risk of the baby developing persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.[11]
 If pulmonary hypertension is suspected based on the above assessments, echocardiography is performed as the next step.[12][15][58] A meta-analysis of Doppler echocardiography for predicting the results of right heart catheterization reported a sensitivity and specificity of 88% and 56%, respectively.[60] Thus, Doppler echocardiography can suggest the presence of pulmonary hypertension, but right heart catheterization (described below) remains the gold standard for diagnosis of PAH.[12][15]
Echocardiography can also help to detect congenital heart disease as a cause of pulmonary hypertension.[12]
 If the echocardiogram is compatible with a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, common causes of pulmonary hypertension (left heart disease and lung disease) are considered and further tests are performed accordingly. These tests generally include electrocardiography (ECG), pulmonary function tests including lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and arterial blood gas measurements, X-rays of the chest and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning.[12][15][58][61]
 If heart disease and lung disease have been excluded, a ventilation/perfusion scan is performed to rule out CTEPH. If unmatched perfusion defects are found, further evaluation by CT pulmonary angiography, right heart catheterization, and selective pulmonary angiography is performed.[12][58]
 Signs of pulmonary hypertension on CT scan of the chest are:
 Although pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) can be estimated on the basis of echocardiography,[63] pressure measurements with a Swan-Ganz catheter inserted through the right side of the heart provide the most definite assessment.[42] Pulmonary hypertension is defined as a mean PAP of at least 20 mm Hg (3300 Pa) at rest, and PAH is defined as precapillary pulmonary hypertension (i.e. mean PAP ≥ 20 mm Hg with pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure [PAOP] ≤ 15 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] > 3 Wood Units).[58] PAOP and PVR cannot be measured directly with echocardiography. Therefore, diagnosis of PAH requires right-sided cardiac catheterization. A Swan-Ganz catheter can also measure the cardiac output; this can be used to calculate the cardiac index, which is far more important in measuring disease severity than the pulmonary arterial pressure.[12][64]
Mean PAP (mPAP) should not be confused with systolic PAP (sPAP), which is often reported on echocardiogram reports. A systolic pressure of 40 mm Hg typically implies a mean pressure of more than 25 mm Hg. Roughly, mPAP = 0.61•sPAP + 2.[65] Due to the invasive nature of this procedure, the use of computational fluid dynamics based hemodynamic indices have been postulated.[66][67]
 For people considered likely to have PAH based on the above tests, the specific associated condition is then determined based on the physical examination, medical/family history and further specific diagnostic tests (for example, serological tests to detect underlying connective tissue disease, HIV infection or hepatitis, ultrasonography to confirm the presence of portal hypertension, echocardiography/cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for congenital heart disease, laboratory tests for schistosomiasis, and high-resolution CT for PVOD and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis). Routine lung biopsy is discouraged in patients with PAH, because of the risk to the patient and because the findings are unlikely to alter the diagnosis and treatment.[12][29][58]
 Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is determined by whether the PH is arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or miscellaneous. If it is caused by left heart disease, the treatment is to optimize left ventricular function by the use of medication or to repair/replace the mitral valve or aortic valve.[68] Patients with left heart failure or hypoxemic lung diseases (groups II or III pulmonary hypertension) should not routinely be treated with vasoactive agents including prostanoids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or endothelin antagonists, as these are approved for the different condition called primary pulmonary arterial hypertension.[69] To make the distinction, doctors at a minimum will conduct cardiac catheterization of the right heart, echocardiography, chest CT, a seven-minute walk test, and pulmonary function testing.[69] Using treatments for other kinds of pulmonary hypertension in patients with these conditions can harm the patient and wastes substantial medical resources.[69]
 High-dose calcium channel blockers are useful in only 5% of IPAH patients who are vasoreactive by Swan-Ganz catheter. Unfortunately, calcium channel blockers have been largely misused, being prescribed to many patients with non-vasoreactive PAH, leading to excess morbidity and mortality.[19] The criteria for vasoreactivity have changed. Only those patients whose mean pulmonary artery pressure falls by more than 10 mm Hg to less than 40 mm Hg with an unchanged or increased cardiac output when challenged with adenosine, epoprostenol, or nitric oxide are considered vasoreactive.[70] Of these, only half of the patients are responsive to calcium channel blockers in the long term.[71]
 A number of agents have recently been introduced for primary and secondary PAH. The trials supporting the use of these agents have been relatively small, and the only measure consistently used to compare their effectivity is the ""six-minute walk test"". Many have no data on mortality benefit or time to progression.[72]
 Sotatercept (Winrevair) was approved for medical use in the United States in March 2024.[73]
 Exercise-based rehabilitation
 A 2023 Cochrane review found that exercise-based rehabilitation may lead to a large increase in exercise capacity and an improvement in health related quality of life, without significantly increasing adverse events.[74]
 Many pathways are involved in the abnormal proliferation and contraction of the smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary arteries in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Three of these pathways are important since they have been targeted with drugs — endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, and prostacyclin derivatives.[75]
 Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) is commonly considered the most effective treatment for PAH. Epoprostenol (synthetic prostacyclin) is given via continuous infusion that requires a semi-permanent central venous catheter. This delivery system can cause sepsis and thrombosis. Prostacyclin is unstable, and therefore has to be kept on ice during administration. Since it has a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes, the infusion has to be continuous, and interruption can be fatal.[76] Other prostanoids have therefore been developed. Treprostinil can be given intravenously or subcutaneously, but the subcutaneous form can be very painful. An increased risk of sepsis with intravenous Remodulin has been reported by the CDC. Iloprost is also used in Europe intravenously and has a longer half life. Iloprost was the only inhaled form of prostacyclin approved for use in the US and Europe, until the inhaled form of treprostinil was approved by the FDA in July 2009.[77]
 Moderate quality evidence suggests that endothelin receptor antagonists improve exercise capacity and decrease symptoms severity.[78] The dual (ETA and ETB) endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan was approved in 2001. Macitentan is another ETA and ETB dual endothelin receptor blocker that is used.[26] Sitaxentan (Thelin) was approved for use in Canada, Australia, and the European Union,[79] but not in the United States. In 2010, Pfizer withdrew sitaxentan worldwide because of fatal liver complications.[80] A similar drug, ambrisentan (which is a ETA endothelin receptor blocker) is sold under the brand name Letairis in the US by Gilead Sciences.[81]
 The US FDA approved sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), for the treatment of PAH in 2005. It is marketed for PAH as Revatio. In 2009, they also approved tadalafil, another PDE5 inhibitor, marketed under the name Adcirca.[82] PDE5 inhibitors are believed to increase pulmonary artery vasodilation, and inhibit vascular remodeling, thus lowering pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance.[83]
 Tadalafil is taken orally, as well as sildenafil, and it is rapidly absorbed (serum levels are detectable at 20 minutes). The T1/2 (biological half-life) hovers around 17.5 hours in healthy subjects.[84] Moreover, if we consider pharmacoeconomic implications, patients that take tadalafil would pay two-thirds of the cost of sildenafil therapy.[85] However, there are some adverse effects of this drug such as headache, diarrhea, nausea, back pain, dyspepsia, flushing and myalgia.[86]
 The combination medication macitentan/tadalafil (Opsynvi) was approved for medical use in Canada in October 2021,[87] and in the United States in March 2024.[88][89]
 Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is the intracellular receptor for NO. As of April 2009[update], the sGC activators cinaciguat and riociguat were undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of PAH.[90]
 Atrial septostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a communication between the right and left atria. It relieves pressure on the right side of the heart, but at the cost of lower oxygen levels in blood (hypoxemia). Lung transplantation replaces a chronic condition with the ongoing need for treatment.[91] There is a post-surgical median survival of just over five years.[92]
 Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) is a surgical procedure that is used for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. It is the surgical removal of an organized thrombus (clot) along with the lining of the pulmonary artery; it is a very difficult, major procedure that is currently performed in a few select centers.[93]
 Established clinical practice guidelines dictate the frequency of pulmonary nodule evaluation and surveillance,[69][94]
patients are normally monitored through commonly available tests such as:[citation needed]
 PAH is considered a universally fatal illness, although survival time may vary between individuals. The prognosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I) has an untreated median survival of 2–3 years from time of diagnosis, with the cause of death usually being right ventricular failure (cor pulmonale).[96] The survival time is variable and depends on many factors.[97] A recent outcome study of those patients who had started treatment with bosentan (Tracleer) showed that 89% of patients were alive at 2 years.[98] With new therapies, survival rates are increasing. For 2,635 patients enrolled in The Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Disease Management (REVEAL Registry) from March 2006 to December 2009, 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year survival rates were 85%, 68%, 57%, and 49%, respectively. For patients with idiopathic/familial PAH, survival rates were 91%, 74%, 65%, and 59%.[99] Levels of mortality are very high in pregnant women with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I). Pregnancy is sometimes described as contraindicated in these women.[100][101][102]
 The epidemiology of IPAH is about 125–150 deaths per year in the U.S., and worldwide the incidence is similar at 4 cases per million. However, in parts of Europe (France), indications are 6 cases per million of IPAH. Females have a higher incidence rate than males (2–9:1).[103]
Other forms of PH are far more common. In systemic scleroderma, the incidence has been estimated to be 8 to 12% of all patients;[104] in rheumatoid arthritis it is rare.[105] However, in systemic lupus erythematosus it is 4 to 14%,[106] and in sickle cell disease, it ranges from 20 to 40%.[107] Up to 4% of people who develop a pulmonary embolism go on to develop chronic thromboembolic disease including pulmonary hypertension.[40] A small percentage of patients with COPD develop pulmonary hypertension with no other disease to explain the high pressure.[108] On the other hand, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome is very commonly associated with right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension.[109]
 For people that inherited the disease, gene therapy is being studied.[110]

"Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries, which carry oxygen-poor blood from your heart to your lungs. The earliest symptom is shortness of breath during your usual routine. The most common causes are heart disease, lung disease and hypoxia. Early diagnosis and treatment can help you enjoy a better quality of life. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a general diagnosis that means you have high blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries. These are the blood vessels that carry oxygen-poor blood from your heart to your lungs. Pulmonary hypertension has many different causes. It’s usually a complication of heart disease or lung disease. But many other diseases and environmental factors can raise your risk for PH. Pulmonary hypertension is dangerous because it disrupts the flow of blood through your heart and lungs. High blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries causes these arteries to become narrow. As a result, your heart must work harder to pump oxygen-poor blood to your lungs. Over time, PH damages your heart and causes problems throughout your body. It can be fatal without treatment. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Pulmonary hypertension can cause serious problems in your body, including: PH is dangerous for people who are pregnant. It can cause complications for both the birthing parent and fetus. Without treatment, pulmonary hypertension can overtax your heart and eventually be fatal. High blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries forces your heart to work harder to send oxygen-poor blood to your lungs. Your right ventricle (lower right chamber) is responsible for pumping this blood to your lungs. So, over time, PH causes your right ventricle to get bigger due to the extra work. This condition (right ventricular hypertrophy) can lead to right-sided heart failure. Right-sided heart failure has a ripple effect throughout your body. It can disrupt the normal workings of many organs and systems. Because pulmonary hypertension can affect your entire body, it’s essential that you’re diagnosed and treated as early as possible. Your provider will prescribe treatment based on what’s causing your PH. No matter the cause, untreated PH is life-threatening. The World Health Organization (WHO) divides pulmonary hypertension into five groups based on its cause. Advertisement Pulmonary hypertension can affect adults at any age. It commonly affects people who have heart or lung conditions. It’s also more common among people with other medical conditions. PH affects: PH usually affects adults. But rarely, it can affect newborns. This is called persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Infants with this condition may need treatment in the intensive care unit. Some types of PH are rare, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and PH caused by blood clots. But other types are much more common, especially PH caused by heart or lung problems. We don’t know exactly how many people around the world have pulmonary hypertension. But some estimates show PH may affect 1 in 100 people. This means 50 million to 70 million people are living with PH. PH is even more common among older adults. Around the world, about 1 in 10 adults over age 65 have PH. Researchers believe the number of people diagnosed with PH will rise in the next few decades. Advertisement The first symptom of pulmonary hypertension is shortness of breath during your daily activities. These may include climbing stairs or grocery shopping. You may also feel short of breath when you exercise. At the start of pulmonary hypertension, you may not have any symptoms. When you do start to notice symptoms, they may be mild. But PH symptoms get worse over time, making it harder for you to do your usual activities. As PH progresses, you’ll feel shortness of breath even when you’re not moving around. Other symptoms include: PH symptoms make it hard for you to exercise or carry out your normal daily routine. There are four main stages of pulmonary hypertension. The World Health Organization (WHO) calls these “functional classes.” They’re based on the symptoms you feel and refer to how well you can carry out your daily activities. As PH gets worse, the symptoms become more noticeable and more disruptive to your daily life. Causes of pulmonary hypertension vary widely depending on the type of PH you have. They include a range of diseases and underlying conditions as well as environmental exposures (toxins and drugs). There are many causes of pulmonary arterial hypertension. They include: Some people develop PAH without any clear cause. These cases are known as “idiopathic.” Heart problems are a common cause of pulmonary hypertension. Because the left and right sides of your heart work together, a problem with the left side also affects the right side. The right side of your heart is responsible for pumping blood into your pulmonary arteries. So, left-sided heart problems cause a chain reaction that affects the rest of your heart, your pulmonary arteries and your lungs. Left-sided heart problems that can cause pulmonary hypertension include: Lung problems are another common cause of pulmonary hypertension. Some people with left-sided heart disease also have lung disease or a lack of oxygen (hypoxia). Lung issues that can cause pulmonary hypertension include: This form of PH is usually caused by chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). CTEPH is a condition that involves blood clots and scarring in the arteries in your lungs. A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that travels from somewhere else in your body and gets stuck in a blood vessel in your lungs. These blood clots are often treatable, but they may leave behind scar tissue. These scars can make it harder for blood to flow through your pulmonary arteries. As a result, the blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries goes up. Many other conditions cause pulmonary hypertension in ways that scientists don’t yet understand. Scientists don’t know the exact mechanisms that cause these conditions to trigger PH. What they do know is that there’s an association between these conditions and PH. That means people with these conditions may face a higher risk of developing PH. Such conditions include: Your provider will perform a physical exam and run tests to reach a pulmonary hypertension diagnosis. First, you’ll have a physical exam to check for signs of pulmonary hypertension as well as other heart or lung issues. During this exam, your provider will: Pulmonary hypertension can be difficult to diagnose since many signs of PH are similar to those of other conditions. So, after your physical exam, your provider may run some tests to get more information. Your provider may also refer you to a pulmonologist or cardiologist. Your provider may use several different tests for different purposes. These tests measure the blood pressure in your pulmonary arteries: These tests look for the underlying cause of pulmonary hypertension: Your provider may also perform a six-minute walk test. This test shows how much exercise you can handle and how much oxygen is circulating in your blood as you exercise. The results indicate if your pulmonary hypertension is mild or severe. Pulmonary hypertension treatment depends on the type of PH you have and your other medical conditions. Your healthcare team will tailor treatment to your individual needs. Right now, only two types of PH can be treated directly: Treatment for other types of PH involves managing the underlying medical conditions. Treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) includes: Treatment for CTEPH includes: Treatment for PH caused by heart or lung problems focuses on managing the underlying conditions. Because so many different heart and lung conditions cause PH, treatment plans can be vastly different from person to person. Talk with your provider about what’s best for you. In general, your provider may recommend: Treatments for PH caused by other medical conditions (WHO Group 5) are still evolving. Your provider will work with you to determine the best care plan. A last resort option for some people with severe pulmonary hypertension is a lung transplant. Pulmonary vasodilators are medications that treat PAH and CTEPH. They can’t be used for other types of PH, including those caused by underlying heart or lung issues. Pulmonary vasodilators help your pulmonary arteries relax. This lowers blood pressure and eases the load on the right side of your heart. People with PH may take a variety of other medications based on their underlying conditions. You may be taking many different medications to treat PH and other medical conditions. It can be a lot to keep track of. Here’s some advice. Risk factors for developing pulmonary hypertension include: Certain medical conditions also raise your risk. These include: Talk with your provider about your risk factors and what you can do to lower your risk. It’s not always possible to prevent pulmonary hypertension. Some risk factors are out of your control. If you have risk factors, your provider may recommend preventive screenings to check your heart and lung function. Doing whatever you can to prevent or manage other medical conditions can help lower your risk of pulmonary hypertension. Steps you can take include: The outlook for people with pulmonary hypertension depends on: The outlook for each person is different. Talk with your provider to learn more about your prognosis and how to manage your condition. Most cases of pulmonary hypertension can’t be cured. Your provider may prescribe medications to: Your provider may also recommend lifestyle changes. However, surgery can cure some people with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The life expectancy varies from person to person. It depends how quickly you’re diagnosed and what other medical conditions you have. Talk with your provider about what you can expect in your individual situation. Pulmonary hypertension is a progressive disease. That means it gets worse over time. It progresses more quickly in some people than in others. Treatment can improve your chances of surviving pulmonary hypertension for many years. Without treatment, pulmonary hypertension leads to right-sided heart failure and, ultimately, death. Treatment can help you live longer and give you a better quality of life. Talk with your provider about how to manage and monitor your condition. Your provider will tell you when you need to come in for checkups and tests. Be sure to tell your provider about any new or changing symptoms. Also, talk with your provider about: Your provider will give you specific recommendations. One key step involves reducing your sodium intake. This means: Other dietary changes include: Call your provider if you’re having problems with: Go to the emergency department or call your local emergency number if you have: A note from Cleveland Clinic A pulmonary hypertension diagnosis can cause a range of emotions. It takes time to process the diagnosis, learn what’s going on inside your body and figure out how to move forward. Work with your provider to get the resources you need. Involve your family and friends in your lifestyle changes. Educate them on your condition. And most of all, know it’s OK to ask for help and lean on others as you adjust to your new normal.

"Stargardt disease  is the most common inherited single-gene retinal disease.[1] In terms of the first description of the disease,[2] it follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which has been later linked to bi-allelic ABCA4 gene variants (STGD1). 
However, there are Stargardt-like diseases with mimicking phenotypes that are referred to as STGD3 and STGD4, and have a autosomal dominant inheritance due to defects with ELOVL4 or PROM1 genes, respectively. It is characterized by macular degeneration that begins in childhood, adolescence or adulthood, resulting in progressive loss of vision.[3]
 The presentation usually occurs in childhood or adolescence, though there is no upper age limit for presentation and late-onset is possible. The main symptom is loss of visual acuity, uncorrectable with glasses. This manifests as the lack of the ability to see fine details when reading or viewing distant objects. Symptoms typically develop before age 20 (median age of onset: ~17 years old),[4] and include: wavy vision, blind spots, blurriness, loss of depth perception, sensitivity to glare, impaired colour vision,[4] and difficulty adapting to dim lighting (delayed dark adaptation). There is a wide variation between individuals in the symptoms experienced as well as the rate of deterioration in vision. Vision loss can be attributed to buildup of byproducts of vitamin A in photoreceptor cells and Peripheral vision is usually less affected than fine, central (foveal) vision.[citation needed]
 Historically from Stargardt's first description of his eponymous disease until recently, the diagnosis was based on looking at the phenotype using examination and investigation of the eye. Since the advent of genetic testing, the picture has become more complex. What was thought to be one disease is, in fact, probably at least three different diseases, each related to a different genetic change. Therefore it is currently a little confusing to define what Stargardt's disease is. Stargardt disease (STGD1) is caused by bi-allelic ABCA4 gene variants (i.e., autosomal recessive). Importantly, the exact genotype (i.e., combinations of both ABCA4 variants) is highly prognostic for the age of onset and disease progression.[5][6][7]
 Autosomal-dominant Stargardt-like diseases were linked to genes such as PROM1 (STGD3) or ELOVL4 (STGD4) missense mutations play a role remains to be seen.[citation needed]
 The carrier frequency in the general population of ABCA4 alleles is 5 to 10%.[8] Different combinations of ABCA4 genes will result in widely different age of onset and retinal pathology. The severity of the disease is inversely proportional to ABCA4 function and it is thought that ABCA4 related disease has a role to play in other diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophies and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).[9]
 In STGD1, the genetic defect causes malfunction of the ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA4) protein of the visual phototransduction cycle. Defective ABCA4 leads to improper shuttling of vitamin A throughout the retina, and accelerated formation of toxic vitamin A dimers (also known as bisretinoids), and associated degradation byproducts. Vitamin A dimers and other byproducts are widely accepted as the cause of STGD1. As such, slowing the formation of vitamin A dimers might lead to a treatment for Stargardt. When vitamin A dimers and byproducts damage the retinal cells, fluorescent granules called lipofuscin in the retinal pigmented epithelium of the retina[12] appear, reflecting such damage.
 In STGD4, a butterfly pattern of dystrophy is caused by mutations in a gene that encodes a membrane bound protein that is involved in the elongation of very long chain fatty acids (ELOVL4)[13]
 Diagnosis is firstly clinical through history and examination usually with a Slit-lamp. If characteristic features are found the investigations undertaken will depend on locally available equipment and may include Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy which highlights areas of autofluorescence which are associated with retinal pathology. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, electroretinography and microperimetry are also useful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Fluorescein angiography is used less often than in the past. These investigations may be followed by genetic testing in order to avoid misdiagnosis. Other diseases may have overlapping phenotypic features with Stargardt Disease and the disease itself has multiple variants. In one study, 35% of patients diagnosed with Stargardt Disease through physical ophthalmic examination were found to be misdiagnosed when subsequent genetic testing was done.[14] Genetic testing can be utilized to ensure a proper diagnosis for which the correct treatment can be applied.
 At present there is no gene therapy for Stargardt Disease. However, ophthalmologists recommend measures that could slow the rate of progression. There are no prospective clinical trials to support these recommendations, but they are based on scientific understanding of the mechanisms underlying the disease pathology. There are three strategies doctors recommend for potential harm reduction: reducing retinal exposure to damaging ultraviolet light,  avoiding excess Vitamin A with the hope of lowering lipofuscin accumulation and maintaining good general health and diet.[citation needed]
 MD Stem Cells' approach using Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cells has shown benefit in various retinal diseases. In Stargardt, 94.1% of patients had improved vision or remained stable with results showing high statistical significance (p=0.0004).[15]  Reasons for improvement may include transfer of organelles (mitochondria, lysosomes), enhanced clearing of toxic Vitamin A byproducts, and neuroprotection of photoreceptors.[16]
 Ultra-violet light has more energy and is a more damaging wavelength spectra than visible light. In an effort to mitigate this, some ophthalmologists may recommend that the patient wears a broad-brimmed hat or sunglasses when they are outdoors.[17] Sometimes, doctors also instruct their patients to wear yellow-tinted glasses (which filter out blue light) when indoors and in artificial light or in front of a digital screen.
 Certain foods, especially carrots, are rich in vitamin A, but the amount from food is not harmful.[17] Foods with a high vitamin A content are often yellow or orange in color, such as squash, pumpkin, and sweet potato, but some, such as liver, are not. There are supplements on the market with more than a daily allowance of vitamin A that should be avoided, but each individual should discuss this with their doctor.
 Smoking, overweight or obesity, and poor diet quality may also contribute to more rapid degeneration. On the other hand, the consumption of oily fish, in a diet similar to that which doctors recommend for age related macular degeneration, can be used to slow the progression of the disease.[citation needed]
 Advances in technology have brought devices that help Stargardt patients who are losing their vision maintain their independence. Low-vision aids can range from hand lenses to electronic devices and can allow those losing their vision to be able to carry out daily activities.[17] Some patients may even opt for in-person services.
 The long-term prognosis for patients with Stargardt disease is widely variable and depends on the age of onset and genetic alleles.[5][6][7]
 The majority of patients will progress to legal blindness, which means that central reading vision will be lost. However, perimetry and microperimetry studies indicate that the peripheral light sensitivity is preserved over a long time in a significant fraction of all patients (i.e., >50%).[6][18] Stargardt disease has no impact on general health and life expectancy is normal.[19]  Some patients, usually those with the late-onset form, can maintain excellent visual acuities for extended periods and are therefore able to perform tasks such as reading or driving.[13]
 A 2017 prospective epidemiologic study that recruited 81 patients with STGD over 12 months reported an incidence of between 1 and 1.28 per 10 000 individuals. The median age of presentation was 27 years (range 5–64 years), most (90%) were symptomatic, with a median visual acuity of Snellen equivalent 20/66.[20]
 Karl Stargardt (1875–1927) was a German ophthalmologist born in Berlin. He studied medicine at the University of Kiel, qualifying in 1899. He later became head of the Bonn University's ophthalmology clinic, followed by a post as chair of ophthalmology at the University of Marburg.  In 1909 he described 7 patients with a recessively inherited macular dystrophy, now known as Stargardt's disease, being described as a progressive and severe reduction of central vision, which develops in the first and second decade of life.
[21][2]
 There are several clinical trials in various stages involving several potential therapeutic areas, gene therapy, stem cell therapy, drug therapy and artificial retinas. In general all are testing the safety and benefits of their respective therapies in phase I or II trials. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dose and effectiveness in small number of people in Phase I with Phase II evaluating similar criteria in a larger population but including a greater insight into potential side effects.[citation needed]
 Gene therapy is designed to insert a copy of a corrected gene into retinal cells.  The hope is to return cell function back to normal and the treatment has the potential to stop disease progression. This therapy will not restore impaired vision back to normal.  The research is being undertaken by a partnership between Sanofi and Oxford BioMedica. A Lentiviral vector is used to deliver a normal gene to the target tissue via a subretinal injection. The therapy is known as SAR422459 and it has been terminated prematurely due to halt in developing the drug product.[22]
 Kubota Vision is in Phase III clinical trials of a visual cycle modulator that modulates RPE65 activity to treat Stargardt's. Kubota Vision published the results of a dose range study of a drug known as Emixustat, with findings that will effect dose selection for their phase III trial set to complete in June 2022.[23]
 Stem-cell therapy involves injecting cells with the potential to mature into differentiated and functioning retinal cells. This therapy has the potential stop disease progression and in the long term improve vision.  To improve vision this technique will need to replicate the complex multi-layered and neurally  anatomy of the retina. There are a number of research groups working with stem cells one of which is Ocata Therapeutics.[24]
 Alkeus Pharma is evaluating the potential of deuterated vitamin A as the drug ALK-001. The hope is that the deuterated vitamin A will reduce the build-up of toxic vitamin A metabolites in the retina and therefore slow rate of visual deterioration.  To create deuterated vitamin A some of the hydrogen atoms are replaced with the isotope deuterium  which has an extra neutron and is therefore twice the standard atomic weight of hydrogen. A Phase II clinical trial is taking place using ALK-001 with an estimated completion date of December 2024.[22][25][26]
 MD Stem Cells, a research-physician clinical development company using autologous bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSC), has released results of the Stargardt Disease cohort within their ongoing Stem Cell Ophthalmology Study II (SCOTS2) clinical trial (NCT 03011541).[27] Average visual improvement was 17.96% (95% CI, 16.39 to 19.53%) with 61.8% of eyes improving and 23.5% remaining stable with no adverse events occurring.[28]
 Retinal implants are in the early stages of development and their use could be of benefit to many people with visual impairment though implanting and maintaining an electrical device within the eye that interfaces with the optic nerve presents many challenges.  An example of a device is made by Argus retinal prosthesis, the camera is an external device held on spectacles, the camera signal is processed and then fed via wires into the retina to terminate in some electrodes that interface with the optic nerve.[29]

"Stargardt disease is an inherited condition that leads to progressive loss of central vision. You’ll likely retain your peripheral vision. You may benefit from participating in clinical trials. Stargardt disease is a genetic eye condition that affects vision in the macula and causes you to lose vision over time. People with Stargardt disease have too much of a fatty yellow substance called lipofuscin. Everyone has lipofuscin, but in people with Stargardt disease, it collects over the macula. The macula is the central part of the retina that gives you clear and sharp central vision. The macula contains light-sensing cells called photoreceptors. The blockages in the macula cause these photoreceptors to die. Stargardt disease has other names, including Stargardt macular degeneration, fundus flavimaculatus and ABCA4 retinopathy, which refers to the genetic mutation of the disease. This gene influences the way your body uses vitamin A. Stargardt disease is usually bilateral (in both eyes). Many people are in their teens or twenties when they’re diagnosed, but this can happen earlier than 10 and later than 30. Stargardt disease affects your central vision. People who have Stargardt disease can keep their peripheral vision. It’s unusual for someone to become completely blind, but you will have issues with low vision. While vision starts getting worse (20/40), it usually stops getting worse at 20/200. We usually think of perfect vision as 20/20 vision. People with 20/40 vision see things at 20 feet the way that others with normal vision see things at 40 feet. People with 20/200 vision see things at 20 feet as clearly as others see things at 200 feet. Some 1 in 10,000 people have this condition.

"Stiff-person syndrome (SPS), also known as stiff-man syndrome,[1] is a rare neurological disorder of unclear cause characterized by progressive muscular rigidity and stiffness. The stiffness primarily affects the truncal muscles and is characterised by spasms, resulting in postural deformities. Chronic pain, impaired mobility, and lumbar hyperlordosis are common symptoms.[2][3]
 SPS occurs in about one in a million people and is most commonly found in middle-aged people. A small minority of patients have the paraneoplastic variety of the condition. Variants of the condition, such as stiff-limb syndrome, which primarily affects a specific limb, are often seen.
 SPS was first described in 1956. Diagnostic criteria were proposed in the 1960s and refined two decades later. In the 1990s and 2000s, the role of antibodies in the condition became clearer. SPS patients generally have glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies, which seldom occur in the general population. In addition to blood tests for GAD, electromyography tests can help confirm the condition's presence.
 Benzodiazepine-class drugs are the most common treatment; they are used for symptom relief from stiffness. Other common treatments include baclofen, intravenous immunoglobin, and rituximab. Limited but encouraging therapeutic experience of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation exists for SPS.[2]
 Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is often separated into several subtypes, based on the cause and progression of the disease.
 There are three clinical classifications of SPS:
 Around 70% of those with SPS have the ""classic"" form of the disease.[5] People with classic SPS typically first experience intermittent tightness or aching in the muscles of the trunk.[6] These muscles repeatedly and involuntarily contract, causing them to grow and rigidify.[6] Eventually, rigidified muscles reduce the affected person's range of motion, slow their voluntary movements, and may cause them to have abnormal posture, particularly lumbar hyperlordosis (a distinctive curve in the lower back).[6] Rigid trunk muscles can also prevent the chest and abdomen from expanding, causing shortness of breath and early satiety.[6] In many people with SPS, muscle rigidity eventually progresses from the trunk to the limbs — first affecting muscles closest to the trunk, then further.[6] Stiffened limbs can affect a person's balance and gait, causing awkward 'statue-like' falls, where the affected person cannot put out their arms to soften the impact.[6] Alongside growing stiffness, many with SPS develop bouts of muscle spasms that are triggered by sudden movements and feeling upset or startled.[6] Spasms are sometimes accompanied by elevated blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and sweating.[6] Some experience chronic muscle pain.[6]
 The muscle stiffness initially fluctuates, sometimes for days or weeks, but eventually begins to consistently impair mobility.[7] As the disease progresses, patients sometimes become unable to walk or bend.[8] Chronic pain is common and worsens over time, but sometimes acute pain occurs as well.[9] Stress, cold weather, and infections lead to an increase in symptoms, and sleep decreases them.[7]
 SPS patients experience superimposed spasms and extreme sensitivity to touch and sound.[7] These spasms primarily occur in the proximal limb and axial muscles.[10] Spasms usually last for minutes and can recur over hours. Attacks of spasms are unpredictable and are often caused by fast movements, emotional distress, or sudden sounds or touches.[8] In rare cases, facial muscles, hands, feet, and the chest can be affected, and unusual eye movements and vertigo occur.[11][12] Brisk stretch reflexes and clonus occur in patients.[7] Late in the disease's progression, hypnagogic myoclonus can occur.[13]
 In addition to their physical symptoms, many with SPS experience neurological and psychiatric disorders.[14] Some with SPS have various neurological disorders that affect physical reflexes and the movement of the eyes.[6] Some also experience anxiety, depression, alcohol use disorders, and phobias — particularly agoraphobia.[6] Most patients are psychologically normal and respond reasonably to their situations. [15]
 A minority of people with SPS experience ""partial"" SPS, also called ""stiff-limb syndrome"", where the muscle contractions and stiffness are limited to the limbs, or sometimes a single limb.[5] This syndrome develops into full SPS about 25% of the time.[16] The stiffness begins in one limb and remains most prominent there. Sphincter and brainstem issues often occur with stiff-limb syndrome. [17]
 Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus, another variant of the condition,[9] includes symptoms of SPS, with brainstem issues, autonomic disturbances, and myoclonus.[17] In some cases, the limbic system is affected, too. Most patients have upper motor neuron issues and autonomic disturbances.[18]
 Around 5% of those with SPS experience the symptoms as a paraneoplastic syndrome — a result of a tumor elsewhere in the body releasing bioactive molecules.[5] Paraneoplastic SPS can affect either a single limb, or the trunk and limbs together.[19][20]
 Patients with SPS generally have high glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody levels in their blood.[21] About 80% of SPS patients have GAD antibodies, compared with about 1% of the general population.[22] The overwhelming majority of people who have GAD antibodies do not develop SPS, indicating that systemic synthesis of the antibody is not the sole cause of SPS.[23] GAD, a presynaptic autoantigen, is generally thought to play a key role in the condition, but exact details of the way autoantibodies affect SPS patients are not known.[24] Most SPS patients with high-titer GAD antibodies also have antibodies that inhibit GABA-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP).[7] Autoantibodies against amphiphysin and gephyrin are also sometimes found in SPS patients.[24] The antibodies appear to interact with antigens in the brain neurons and the spinal-cord synapses, causing a functional blockade of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).[7] This leads to GABA impairment, which probably causes the stiffness and spasms that characterize SPS.[21] There are low GABA levels in the motor cortexes of SPS patients. [7]
 Why GAD autoimmunity occurs in SPS patients is unknown,[25] and whether SPS qualifies as a neuroautoimmune disorder has been questioned.[26] Also unknown is whether these antibodies are pathogenic.[25] The level of GAD antibody titers found in SPS patients does not correlate with disease severity,[21] indicating that these titer levels do not need to be monitored.[27] GAD antibodies have not been proven to be the sole cause of SPS, but possibly they are a marker or an epiphenomenon of the condition's cause.[28]
 In SPS patients, motor-unit neurons fire involuntarily in a way that resembles a normal contraction. Motor-unit potentials fire while the patient is at rest, particularly in the muscles that are stiff.[7] The excessive firing of motor neurons may be caused by malfunctions in spinal and suprasegmental inhibitory networks that use GABA.[7] Involuntary actions show up as voluntary on EMG scans;[13] even when the patient tries to relax, agonist and antagonist contractions occur.[22]
 In a minority of patients with SPS, breast, ovarian, or lung cancer manifests paraneoplastically as proximal muscle stiffness. These cancers are associated with the synaptic proteins amphiphysin and gephyrin. Paraneoplastic SPS with amphiphysin antibodies and breast adenocarcinoma tend to occur together. These patients tend not to have GAD antibodies.[7] Passive transfer of SPS by plasma injection has been demonstrated in paraneoplastic SPS, but not in classical SPS.[28]
 Evidence exists of genetic influence on SPS risk. The HLA class II locus makes patients susceptible to the condition. Most SPS patients have the DQB1* 0201 allele.[7] This allele is also associated with type 1 diabetes.[29]
 SPS is diagnosed by evaluating clinical findings and excluding other conditions.[7] No specific laboratory test confirms its presence.[5] Due to the rarity and varied symptoms of SPS, most affected by the disease wait several years before they are correctly diagnosed.[5]
 The presence of antibodies against GAD is the best indication of the condition that can be detected by blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. Anti-GAD65 is found in about 80% of SPS patients. Antithyroid, antiintrinsic factor, antinuclear, anti-RNP, and antigliadin antibodies are also often found in blood tests. Electromyography  demonstrates involuntary motor unit firing in SPS patients.[7] It can confirm the SPS diagnosis by noting spasms in distant muscles as a result of subnoxious stimulation of cutaneous or mixed nerves.[13] Responsiveness to diazepam helps confirm that the patient has SPS, as this drug decreases stiffness and motor-unit firing.[7]
 The same general criteria are used to diagnose paraneoplastic SPS as for the normal form of the condition.[15] Once SPS is diagnosed, poor response to conventional therapies and the presence of cancer indicate that it may be paraneoplastic.[7] CT scans are indicated for SPS patients who respond poorly to therapy to determine if cancer is the cause.[30]
 A variety of conditions have similar symptoms to SPS, including myelopathies, dystonias, spinocerebellar degenerations, primary lateral sclerosis, neuromyotonia, and some psychogenic disorders.[7] Tetanus, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperpyrexia, chronic spinal interneuronitis, serotonin syndrome,[31] multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease should also be excluded.[31]
 Patients' fears and phobias often incorrectly lead doctors to think their symptoms are psychogenic,[32] and they are sometimes suspected of malingering.[12] An average of six years pass after the onset of symptoms before the disease is diagnosed.[32]
 No evidence-based treatment has been found for SPS, nor have large, controlled trials of treatments for the condition been conducted. The rarity of the disease complicates efforts to establish guidelines.[31]
 The progression of SPS depends on whether it is a typical or abnormal form of the condition, and the presence of comorbidities.[33] Early recognition and neurological treatment can limit its progression. SPS is generally responsive to treatment,[34] but the condition usually progresses and stabilizes periodically.[35] Even with treatment, quality of life generally declines as stiffness precludes many activities.[9] Some patients require mobility aids due to the risk of falls.[12] About 65% of SPS patients are unable to function independently.[36] About 10% require intensive care at some point;[35] sudden death occurs in about the same percentage of patients.[34] These deaths are usually caused by metabolic acidosis or an autonomic crisis.[35]
 SPS is estimated to have a prevalence of about one or two per million people.[37] It affects women up to three times as frequently as men.[37] In the United Kingdom, 119 cases were identified between 2000 and 2005.[36] It does not predominantly occur in any racial or ethnic group.[21] SPS can start at any age,[5] though it most frequently occurs in people in their 40s.[21] About 35% of SPS patients have type I diabetes.[7]
 SPS was first described by Frederick Moersch and Henry Woltman in 1956, who named it ""stiff-man syndrome"". Their description of the disease was based on 14 cases that they had observed over 32 years. Using electromyography, they noted that motor-unit firing suggested that contractions of voluntary muscle were occurring in their patients.[36] Previously, cases of SPS had been dismissed as psychogenic problems.[38] Clinical diagnostic criteria were developed by Gordon et al. in 1967. They observed ""persistent tonic contraction reflected in constant firing, even at rest"" after providing patients with muscle relaxants and examining them with electromyography.[36] In 1989, criteria for an SPS diagnosis were adopted that included episodic axial stiffness, progression of stiffness, lordosis, and triggered spasms.[39] The name of the disease was shifted from ""stiff-man syndrome"" to the gender-neutral ""stiff-person syndrome"" in 1991.[39]
 In 1963, diazepam was determined to help alleviate symptoms of SPS.[7] Corticosteroids were first used to treat the condition in 1988, and plasma exchange was first applied the following year.[24] The first use of intravenous immunoglobulin to treat the condition came in 1994.[24]
 In 1988, Solimena et al. discovered that autoantibodies against GAD played a key role in SPS.[36] Two years later, Solimena found the antibodies in 20 out of 33 patients examined.[40] In the late 1980s, the serum of SPS patients was also found to bind to GABAergic neurons.[25] In 2006, the role of GABARAP in SPS was discovered.[24] The first case of paraneoplastic SPS was found in 1975.[41] In 1993, antiamphiphysin was shown to play a role in paraneoplastic SPS,[24] and seven years later, antigephyrin was also found to be involved in the condition.[24]
 In December 2022, singer Céline Dion announced that she is suffering from this syndrome, resulting in cancelled performances.[42]

"Stiff person syndrome is a rare, chronic condition that causes muscle stiffness and painful muscle spasms. The severity of symptoms varies from person to person. There’s no cure for stiff person syndrome, but treatment can help manage symptoms and slow the progression of the condition. Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder that causes muscle stiffness in your trunk and abdomen (the middle part of your body). Over time, you may also develop stiffness (rigidity) and spasms in your legs and other muscles. Walking may be difficult, and you may become more prone to falls and injury. Understanding and managing your stiff person syndrome diagnosis can be overwhelming. Your healthcare team will create a treatment plan that’s unique to you and your symptoms, as they vary from person to person. It’s important to make sure you’re getting the support you need to stay healthy by scheduling regular visits with your providers throughout your life. Stiff person syndrome used to be called “stiff man syndrome,” but the name was updated to be more inclusive, as the condition can affect people of any age and sex. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy The two main symptoms of stiff person syndrome are: Symptoms can develop at any age, but they most often begin in your 30s and 40s. Stiff person syndrome symptoms can spread to other areas of your body and/or get worse over time. Symptoms can take several months to a few years to develop. Some people’s symptoms remain the same for years. Others experience slowly worsening symptoms, including more severe spasticity/rigidity, which can limit their ability to perform activities of daily living. In most cases of stiff person syndrome, the first symptom you’ll experience is muscle stiffness in your trunk (abdomen, chest and back muscles). The rigidity causes pain and an aching discomfort. These symptoms can fluctuate (swing) in severity without a clear reason or trigger. They can also affect your arms and legs. As stiffness increases, some people develop an abnormal posture that can make it difficult to walk or move. Painful muscle spasms are another symptom of stiff person syndrome. They can involve your entire body or only a specific area. These spasms can last a few seconds, minutes or, occasionally, a few hours. Symptoms of stiff person syndrome, like muscle spasms, can trigger (happen) after: Due to the unpredictable triggers of muscle spasms, some people with SPS develop anxiety and agoraphobia — an extreme fear of entering open or crowded places or of leaving their homes. This is because it’s more difficult to avoid the triggers of muscle spasms out in public. Researchers don’t know the exact cause of stiff person syndrome. But they think it’s an autoimmune condition. This is a condition in which your immune system attacks healthy cells for unknown reasons. Studies suggest antibodies may play a role in SPS. Many people with stiff person syndrome make antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). GAD makes a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which helps control muscle movement. Researchers don’t yet understand the exact role that GAD plays in the development and worsening of stiff person syndrome. It’s important to note that the presence of GAD antibodies doesn’t mean that you have stiff person syndrome. In fact, a small portion of the general population has GAD antibodies without any adverse effects. There are other antibodies associated with stiff person syndrome, including glycine receptor, amphiphysin and DPPX (dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 6) antibodies. There are also some people with this condition who have no detectable known antibodies. Research is ongoing to discover if other potential antibodies may also cause symptoms. Women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB) are twice as likely to have stiff person syndrome as men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB). Stiff person syndrome may also happen with other autoimmune conditions, like: Stiff person syndrome is very rare. About 1 out of every 1 million people have this condition. Advertisement A healthcare provider will diagnose stiff person syndrome by looking for specific signs of the condition with exams and testing. They’ll ask you questions about your symptoms during a physical exam and neurological exam. If your provider suspects stiff person syndrome, they may offer tests, which could include: Stiff person syndrome can be difficult to diagnose, as it’s rare and its symptoms are similar to other conditions, like ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune conditions. There are several different subtypes or classifications for stiff person syndrome, including: The two main treatment strategies for stiff person syndrome include: Treatment for stiff person syndrome varies based on your symptoms. Treatment aims to manage how symptoms affect you and improve your mobility and comfort. Your healthcare team may include several specialists, including: Medications can help decrease stiffness, rigidity and painful muscle spasms, including: Therapies that may also help manage symptoms include: There’s some evidence to suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment (a type of immunotherapy) can improve stiff person syndrome symptoms. IVIg contains immunoglobulins (natural antibodies your immune system produces) donated by thousands of people with healthy immune systems. Advertisement There’s currently no cure for stiff person syndrome. Treatment can help you manage symptoms. As stiff person syndrome is an autoimmune-related condition, there isn’t anything you can do to prevent it. Stiff person syndrome is a chronic (lifelong) condition. The prognosis (outlook) varies from person to person based on a few factors, including: Starting treatment soon after symptoms begin is essential to prevent or lessen the syndrome’s progression and avoid long-term complications. Most people with stiff person syndrome improve with medications, but it can still be difficult to manage triggers that cause muscle spasms. Over time, walking can become more and more difficult. Your ability to perform daily routine tasks may also decline over time. The increased risk of falls also becomes a growing concern as the condition worsens. You may need to use a cane, walker or wheelchair for assistance. If possible, try to find a healthcare provider who specializes in researching and treating stiff person syndrome. Because the syndrome is rare, this could be difficult. You may have to advocate for yourself to ensure you get the best medical care that can help you have the best quality of life. It’s common for people with stiff person syndrome to experience anxiety or depression related to the condition. If you’re experiencing mental health symptoms, it’s important to talk to your provider or a mental health specialist, like a therapist or psychologist. You and your family may also want to consider joining a support group to meet others who can relate to your experiences. If you have stiff person syndrome, you’ll need to see your healthcare team regularly to check if your treatment is working and to monitor the progression of your symptoms. If you notice new symptoms or side effects of your medications, talk to your provider. If you have stiff person syndrome, it may help to ask your healthcare provider the following questions: It isn’t easy learning that you have a rare condition like stiff person syndrome. You may feel overwhelmed and unsure of what your future may look like. But you don’t have to face this alone. Your care team will be with you to answer any questions and help you manage symptoms as they arise. While your care may focus on your physical health, make sure to monitor your mental health as well. Symptoms affect each person differently. But living with pain, discomfort and unpredictable muscle spasms can take a toll on your emotional well-being. Stiff person syndrome may make going out in public or performing everyday tasks more difficult, so don’t hesitate to contact a healthcare provider in addition to loved ones if you need support.

"Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare autoimmune neurological disorder that causes muscle spasms and stiffness. SPS affects the way your brain and spinal cord control muscle movements. On Dec. 8, 2022, Canadian singer Celine Dion revealed that she had been diagnosed with SPS.  “While we’re still learning about this rare condition, we now know this is what’s been causing all of the spasms that I’ve been having. Unfortunately, these spasms affect every aspect of my daily life, sometimes causing difficulties when I walk and not allowing me to use my vocal cords to sing the way I’m used to,” Dion said in her announcement on Instagram. What is SPS exactly? Read on to learn about the causes and treatment for this condition. An autoimmune disorder occurs when your immune system attacks healthy tissues.  SPS causes you to experience episodes of muscle spasms and stiffness. It is a progressive disorder that can impede walking and other essential daily functioning skills. Without treatment, SPS can significantly interfere with your quality of life. It is a rare disorder affecting only about 1-2 people per million. It has been described as starting between the ages of 30 and 60 and appears more common in females. Most notably, SPS causes muscle stiffness. The symptoms include: SPS spasms can be very strong and may cause you to fall if standing. They can sometimes be strong enough to break bones. The spasms may be worse when you’re anxious or upset. Sudden movements, loud noise, or touching can also trigger involuntary spasms.  When you’re living with SPS, you may also have depression or anxiety. This may be caused by other symptoms you might be experiencing or a decrease in neurotransmitters in the brain.  The potential for emotional distress can increase as SPS progresses. You may notice the spams worsen when you’re out in public. This may lead you to develop anxiety about going out in public.  You may experience increased muscle stiffness and rigidity in the later stages of SPS. Muscle stiffness can also affect other body parts, such as your face. This can include muscles used for eating and talking. Muscles involved in breathing may also be affected, causing life threatening breathing problems.  People with SPS have antibodies that attack proteins in the brain neurons that control muscle movements. These proteins can be glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), gephyrin, or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The reason some people develop SPS is unknown. There are some risk factors, but not everyone who develops SPS has the associated risk factors.  SPS may coexist with other autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anemia, vitiligo, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and autoimmune thyroid disease. Your symptoms may vary depending on the type of SPS you have. Other than its classic presentation, which affects 70% to 80% of people with SPS, SPS can present as: To diagnose SPS, your doctor will examine your medical history and perform a physical exam. Signs of SPS are: They will consider other causes of movement problems with muscle spasms, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson’s disease, which have their own diagnostic criteria. SPS might be considered when the signs and symptoms don’t fit with more common neurological conditions.  The doctor may also do electromyography (EMG) to measure your muscular electrical activity. Your doctor may also order a blood test to detect the GAD or other antibodies. Not everyone with SPS has these antibodies. However, up to 80% of people living with SPS do have elevated GAD antibodies.  There’s no cure for SPS. However, treatments are available to help you manage your symptoms. Certain treatments may also stop the condition from getting worse. Muscle spasms and stiffness may be treated with one or more of the following medications: You may also need to take medications for pain and discomfort. Antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may help with depression and anxiety. However, they have also been found to exacerbate SPS themselves. Additional treatments have been shown to help prevent the disease process of SPS. These include: In addition to medications, your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist. Physical therapy alone can’t treat SPS. However, the exercises may significantly help with your: Depending on your symptoms, your physical therapist will guide you through mobility and relaxation exercises. With the help of your therapist, you may even be able to practice some movements at home.  If you’re living with this condition, you’re more prone to falls because of a lack of stability and reflexes. This can increase your risk for severe injuries and even permanent disability.  Occasionally, SPS can progress and spread to other areas of your body. There’s no cure for SPS. However, treatments can help you manage symptoms. Your overall outlook depends on how well your treatment plan works.  There are different treatments, and it isn’t possible to predict with certainty which treatments will be most effective.

"A stroke is your brain’s equivalent of a heart attack, happening when there’s an issue with blood flow to part of your brain. This can happen when blood vessels are blocked or because of bleeding in your brain. Strokes are a life-threatening emergency, and immediate medical attention is critical to prevent permanent damage or death. A stroke is a life-threatening condition that happens when part of your brain doesn’t have enough blood flow. This most commonly happens because of a blocked artery or bleeding in your brain. Without a steady supply of blood, the brain cells in that area start to die from a lack of oxygen. IMPORTANT: A stroke is a life-threatening emergency condition where every second counts. If you or someone with you has symptoms of a stroke, IMMEDIATELY call 911 (or your local emergency services number). The quicker stroke is treated, the more likely you’ll recover without disability. To recognize the warning signs of a stroke, remember to think BE FAST: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Anybody can have a stroke, from children to adults, but there are some people who have a greater risk than others. Strokes are more common later in life (about two-thirds of strokes happen in people over age 65). There are also certain medical conditions that increase the risk of stroke, including high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia), Type 2 diabetes, and people who have a history of stroke, heart attack or irregular heart rhythms like atrial fibrillation. Strokes are very common. Worldwide, strokes rank second among the top causes of death. In the United States, stroke is the fifth cause of death. Strokes are also a leading cause of disability worldwide. Advertisement Strokes are to your brain what a heart attack is to your heart. When you have a stroke, part of your brain loses its blood supply, which keeps that brain area from getting oxygen. Without oxygen, the affected brain cells become oxygen-starved and stop working properly. If your brain cells go too long without oxygen, they’ll die. If enough brain cells in an area die, the damage becomes permanent, and you may lose the abilities that area once controlled. However, restoring blood flow may prevent that kind of damage or at least limit how severe it is. That’s why time is critical in treating a stroke. There are two main ways that strokes can happen: ischemia and hemorrhage. Ischemia (pronounced “iss-key-me-uh”) is when cells don’t get enough blood flow to supply them with oxygen. This usually happens because something blocks blood vessels in your brain, cutting off blood flow. Ischemic strokes are the most common and account for about 80% of all strokes. Ischemic strokes usually happen in one of the following ways: Hemorrhagic (pronounced “hem-or-aj-ick”) strokes cause bleeding in or around your brain. This happens in one of two ways: Advertisement Different areas of your brain control different abilities, so stroke symptoms depend on the affected area. An example of this is a stroke that affects Broca’s area, a part of your brain that controls how you use muscles in your face and mouth to speak. That’s why some people slur their words or have trouble speaking when they have a stroke. The symptoms of stroke can involve one or more of the following: A transient ischemic attack (TIA) — sometimes called a “mini-stroke” — is like a stroke, but the effects are temporary. These are often warning signs that a person has a very high risk of having a true stroke in the near future. Because of that, a person who has a TIA needs emergency medical care as soon as possible. Ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes can happen for many reasons. Ischemic strokes usually happen because of blood clots. These can happen for various reasons, such as: Hemorrhagic strokes can happen for several reasons also, including: Several other conditions and factors can contribute to a person’s stroke risk. These include: Strokes aren’t contagious and you can’t pass them to or get them from other people. A healthcare provider can diagnose a stroke using a combination of a neurological examination, diagnostic imaging and other tests. During a neurological examination, a provider will have you do certain tasks or answer questions. As you perform these tasks or answer these questions, the provider will look for telltale signs that show a problem with how part of your brain works. The most common tests that happen when a healthcare provider suspects a stroke include: Treating a stroke depends on many different factors. The most important factor in determining treatment is what kind of stroke a person has. The medications and treatments used vary depending on the type of stroke and how soon a person receives treatment after the stroke. There are also long-term treatments for stroke. These happen in the days and months after emergency treatment deals with a stroke’s immediate threat. Overall, your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you what kind of treatment(s) they recommend. They can tailor the information they provide to your specific case, including your medical history, personal circumstances and more. Some examples of treatments for stroke are as follows:  Thrombolytic drugs (their name is a combination of the Greek words “thrombus,” which means “clot,” and “lysis,” which means “loosening/dissolving”) are an option within the first three hours after stroke symptoms start. These medications dissolve existing clots. But they’re only an option within that three- to four-and-a-half hour time frame because after that, they increase the risk of dangerous bleeding complications. In some cases, especially ones where thrombolytic drugs aren’t an option, a catheterization procedure known as mechanical thrombectomy is an option. Thrombectomy procedures are also time-sensitive, and the best window for these procedures is within 24 hours after symptoms start. This procedure involves inserting a catheter (tube-like) device into a major blood vessel and steering it up to the clot in your brain. Once there, the catheter has a tool at its tip that can remove the clot. Because high blood pressure is usually why hemorrhagic strokes happen, lowering blood pressure is a key part of treating them. Lowering blood pressure limits bleeding and makes it easier for clotting to seal the damaged blood vessel. Your body’s clotting ability relies on a process called hemostasis to stop bleeding and repair injuries. Supporting hemostasis involves infusion of medications or blood factors that make it easier for clotting to happen. Examples include vitamin K therapy, prothrombin or clotting factor infusions, and more. This treatment is most common with hemorrhagic strokes, and can help control bleeding (especially for people who take blood-thinning medications). In some cases, surgery is necessary to relieve the pressure on your brain. This is especially true with subarachnoid hemorrhages, which are easier to reach because they’re on the outer surface of your brain. There are several other ways that stroke treatment can happen. Some of these treatments are supportive directly, while others help avoid complications. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about these other treatments and which ones they recommend and why. One of the most important ways to treat stroke is to help a person recover or adapt to the changes in their brain. That’s especially true when it comes to helping them regain abilities they had before the stroke. Stroke rehabilitation is a major part of recovery for most people who have a stroke. That rehabilitation can take many forms, including: Other therapies are possible, depending on your case and circumstances. Your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you what kind of treatments can benefit you. The side effects of stroke treatments depend greatly on the type of stroke, the treatments used, your medical history and more. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the side effects you can or should expect and what you can do to manage or even prevent them. A stroke is a life-threatening medical emergency, and you shouldn't try to self-diagnose or self-treat it. If you have — or someone with you has — stroke symptoms, you should immediately call 911 (or your local emergency services number). The longer it takes for stroke treatment to begin, the greater the risk of permanent brain damage or death. The recovery time and how long it takes to feel better after treatment both depend on many factors. Your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you what you can expect and the likely timeline for your recovery. There are many things you can do to reduce your risk of having a stroke. While this doesn’t mean you can prevent a stroke, it can lower your risk. Actions you can take include: If you’re at risk for any kind of stroke, your healthcare provider may recommend changing your diet to avoid increases in blood pressure. Examples of this include: If you have a stroke, many factors affect what you can expect, such as how big it is and where it is in your brain. There are also some key differences between ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. In general, the more severe an ischemic stroke is, the worse the damage. When brain damage is more severe, it’s more likely that you’ll lose certain abilities, at least temporarily. The faster you get medical attention for stroke symptoms, the better your chances that these effects are temporary or less severe. These strokes usually cause much worse symptoms, especially when bleeding is more severe. The symptoms of hemorrhagic stroke tend to get worse quickly. People with hemorrhagic strokes tend to cause severe headaches, seizures and coma. A stroke lasts as long as there’s a lack of blood flow to part of your brain. Without treatment, a stroke will continue until the brain cells in the affected areas of your brain die, causing permanent damage. Even after you receive treatment for a stroke, it’s common for the effects to linger. Most people will take weeks or even months to recover. Most of the progress in recovery happens within the first six months to 18 months (approximately) after a stroke. Further progress is possible after that, but can be harder to achieve or take longer. Your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you when you can return to your usual routine and activities. But it’s important not to push yourself too hard. Without enough time to recover, you could cause another stroke or other complications. Strokes have the potential to cause death when they’re severe or if they go too long without treatment. However, the outlook can still vary widely depending on many factors. Those factors include where in your brain a stroke happens, how severe it is, your health history and more. Your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you more about the outlook for your situation. The information they provide will be the most accurate and most relevant information that you can get. If you have a stroke, your healthcare provider will talk with you about a plan for treatment and the timeline for your recovery. They may also prescribe medications, recommend therapy options and more. It’s important to talk with your healthcare provider about why they recommend these and what they can do for you. Once you and your provider finalize the treatment plan, it’s very important that you follow it as closely as possible. Doing that will give you the best chance to maximize how much you recover. Other things you can do include: You should see your healthcare provider as recommended. You should also see them if you notice any new symptoms affecting you, especially symptoms that might have a connection to your previous stroke. Even symptoms that don’t seem connected might be important, so don’t wait to discuss them with your healthcare provider. You should call 911 (or your local emergency services number) and go to the nearest ER if you experience any symptoms of another stroke (see the FAST criteria at the top of this article to know the symptoms for which you should watch). You should also go to the hospital if you experience any of the symptoms of dangerous complications that are common after a stroke. The most common complicating conditions include: A note from Cleveland Clinic A stroke is your brain’s version of a heart attack, making it a critical, life-threatening medical emergency. Strokes are also time-sensitive, and delays in care can lead to permanent brain damage and death. Strokes can be frightening for those who experience them or people nearby. But the treatment options for stroke are expanding every day thanks to advances in our understanding of the brain, technological leaps in imaging and new medications. If you notice the symptoms of a stroke in yourself or someone you’re with, immediate medical attention is critical. The faster a person having a stroke gets medical care, the more likely the effects of the stroke will be limited or even reversible. Last reviewed on 09/22/2022.

 A stroke is a serious life-threatening medical condition that happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. Strokes are a medical emergency and urgent treatment is essential. The sooner a person receives treatment for a stroke, the less damage is likely to happen. If you suspect that you or someone else is having a stroke, phone 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance. The main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word FAST: Like all organs, the brain needs the oxygen and nutrients provided by blood to function properly. If the supply of blood is restricted or stopped, brain cells begin to die. This can lead to brain injury, disability and possibly death. There are 2 main causes of strokes: There's also a related condition called a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), where the blood supply to the brain is temporarily interrupted. This causes what's known as a mini-stroke. It can last a few minutes or persist up to 24 hours. TIAs should be treated urgently, as they're often a warning sign you're at risk of having a full stroke in the near future. Get medical advice as soon as possible, even if your symptoms get better. Certain conditions increase the risk of having a stroke, including: Treatment depends on the type of stroke you have, including which part of the brain was affected and what caused it. Strokes are usually treated with medicine. This includes medicines to prevent and dissolve blood clots, reduce blood pressure and reduce cholesterol levels. In some cases, procedures may be required to remove blood clots. Surgery may also be needed to treat brain swelling and reduce the risk of further bleeding if this was the cause of your stroke. People who survive a stroke are often left with long-term problems caused by injury to their brain. Some people need a long period of rehabilitation before they can recover their former independence, while many never fully recover and need ongoing support after their stroke. Local authorities should provide free reablement services for anyone assessed as needing them. These services help the person recovering from a stroke learn or relearn the skills they need to live at home independently. Some people will continue to need some form of care or help with their daily activities. For example, a care worker may come to the person's home to help with washing and dressing, or to provide companionship. Read about: If you're recovering from a stroke or caring for someone who is, you may find the social care and support guide useful. It's written for people with care and support needs, as well as their carers and relatives. You can significantly reduce your risk of having a stroke if you: If you have a condition that increases your risk of a stroke, it's important to manage it effectively. For example, taking medicine you've been prescribed to lower high blood pressure or cholesterol levels. If you've had a stroke or TIA in the past, these measures are particularly important because your risk of having another stroke is greatly increased. Stroke does not just affect adults. Every year around 400 children in the UK have a stroke, according to the Stroke Association.

 Stroke (also known as a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or brain attack) is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death.[5] There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding.[5] Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly.[5]
 Signs and symptoms of stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side.[2][3] Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred.[3] If symptoms last less than one or two hours, the stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke.[3] Hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache.[3] The symptoms of stroke can be permanent.[5] Long-term complications may include pneumonia and loss of bladder control.[3]
 The biggest risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure.[7] Other risk factors include high blood cholesterol, tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, a previous TIA, end-stage kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation.[2][7][8] Ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes.[13][14][15] Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain's membranes.[13][16] Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm.[13] Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam and supported by medical imaging such as a CT scan or MRI scan.[9] A CT scan can rule out bleeding, but may not necessarily rule out ischemia, which early on typically does not show up on a CT scan.[10] Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and rule out other possible causes.[9] Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms.[9]
 Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic carotid narrowing, and warfarin in people with atrial fibrillation.[2] Aspirin or statins may be recommended by physicians for prevention.[2] Stroke is a medical emergency.[5] Ischemic strokes, if detected within three to four-and-a-half hours, may be treatable with medication that can break down the clot,[2] while hemorrhagic strokes sometimes benefit from surgery.[2] Treatment to attempt recovery of lost function is called stroke rehabilitation, and ideally takes place in a stroke unit; however, these are not available in much of the world.[2]
 In 2023, 15 million people worldwide had a stroke.[17] In 2015, there were about 42.4 million people who had previously had stroke and were still alive.[11] Between 1990 and 2010 the annual incidence of stroke decreased by approximately 10% in the developed world, but increased by 10% in the developing world.[18] In 2015, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease, accounting for 6.3 million deaths (11% of the total).[12] About 3.0 million deaths resulted from ischemic stroke while 3.3 million deaths resulted from hemorrhagic stroke.[12] About half of people who have had stroke live less than one year.[2] Overall, two thirds of cases of stroke occurred in those over 65 years old.[18]
 Stroke can be classified into two major categories: ischemic and hemorrhagic.[19] Ischemic stroke is caused by interruption of the blood supply to the brain, while hemorrhagic stroke results from the rupture of a blood vessel or an abnormal vascular structure. About 87% of stroke is ischemic, with the rest being hemorrhagic. Bleeding can develop inside areas of ischemia, a condition known as ""hemorrhagic transformation."" It is unknown how many cases of hemorrhagic stroke actually start as ischemic stroke.[2]
 In the 1970s the World Health Organization defined ""stroke"" as a ""neurological deficit of cerebrovascular cause that persists beyond 24 hours or is interrupted by death within 24 hours"",[20] although the word ""stroke"" is centuries old. This definition was supposed to reflect the reversibility of tissue damage and was devised for the purpose, with the time frame of 24 hours being chosen arbitrarily. The 24-hour limit divides stroke from transient ischemic attack, which is a related syndrome of stroke symptoms that resolve completely within 24 hours.[2] With the availability of treatments that can reduce stroke severity when given early, many now prefer alternative terminology, such as ""brain attack"" and ""acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome"" (modeled after heart attack and acute coronary syndrome, respectively), to reflect the urgency of stroke symptoms and the need to act swiftly.[21]
 During ischemic stroke, blood supply to part of the brain is decreased, leading to dysfunction of the brain tissue in that area. There are four reasons why this might happen:
 Stroke without an obvious explanation is termed cryptogenic stroke (idiopathic); this constitutes 30–40% of all cases of ischemic stroke.[2][24]
 There are classification systems for acute ischemic stroke. The Oxford Community Stroke Project classification (OCSP, also known as the Bamford or Oxford classification) relies primarily on the initial symptoms; based on the extent of the symptoms, the stroke episode is classified as total anterior circulation infarct (TACI), partial anterior circulation infarct (PACI), lacunar infarct (LACI) or posterior circulation infarct (POCI). These four entities predict the extent of the stroke, the area of the brain that is affected, the underlying cause, and the prognosis.[25][26] The TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification is based on clinical symptoms as well as results of further investigations; on this basis, stroke is classified as being due to (1) thrombosis or embolism due to atherosclerosis of a large artery, (2) an embolism originating in the heart, (3) complete blockage of a small blood vessel, (4) other determined cause, (5) undetermined cause (two possible causes, no cause identified, or incomplete investigation).[27] Users of stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine are at a high risk for ischemic stroke.[28]
 There are two main types of hemorrhagic stroke:[29][30]
 The above two main types of hemorrhagic stroke are also two different forms of intracranial hemorrhage, which is the accumulation of blood anywhere within the cranial vault; but the other forms of intracranial hemorrhage, such as epidural hematoma (bleeding between the skull and the dura mater, which is the thick outermost layer of the meninges that surround the brain) and subdural hematoma (bleeding in the subdural space), are not considered ""hemorrhagic stroke"".[31]
 Hemorrhagic stroke may occur on the background of alterations to the blood vessels in the brain, such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral arteriovenous malformation and an intracranial aneurysm, which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage.[32]
 In addition to neurological impairment, hemorrhagic stroke usually causes specific symptoms (for instance, subarachnoid hemorrhage classically causes a severe headache known as a thunderclap headache) or reveal evidence of a previous head injury.
 Stroke symptoms typically start suddenly, over seconds to minutes, and in most cases do not progress further. The symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected. The more extensive the area of the brain affected, the more functions that are likely to be lost. Some forms of stroke can cause additional symptoms. For example, in intracranial hemorrhage, the affected area may compress other structures. Most forms of stroke are not associated with a headache, apart from subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral venous thrombosis and occasionally intracerebral hemorrhage.[32]
 Systems have been proposed to increase recognition of stroke. Sudden-onset face weakness, arm drift (i.e., if a person, when asked to raise both arms, involuntarily lets one arm drift downward) and abnormal speech are the findings most likely to lead to the correct identification of a case of stroke, increasing the likelihood by 5.5 when at least one of these is present. Similarly, when all three of these are absent, the likelihood of stroke is decreased (– likelihood ratio of 0.39).[33] While these findings are not perfect for diagnosing stroke, the fact that they can be evaluated relatively rapidly and easily make them very valuable in the acute setting.
 A mnemonic to remember the warning signs of stroke is FAST (facial droop, arm weakness, speech difficulty, and time to call emergency services),[34] as advocated by the Department of Health (United Kingdom) and the Stroke Association, the American Stroke Association, and the National Stroke Association (US). FAST is less reliable in the recognition of posterior circulation stroke.[35] The revised mnemonic BE FAST, which adds balance (sudden trouble keeping balance while walking or standing) and eyesight (new onset of blurry or double vision or sudden, painless loss of sight)  to the assessment, has been proposed to address this shortcoming and improve early detection of stroke even further.[36][37] Other scales for prehospital detection of stroke include the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS)[38] and the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS),[39] on which the FAST method was based.[40] Use of these scales is recommended by professional guidelines.[41]
 For people referred to the emergency room, early recognition of stroke is deemed important as this can expedite diagnostic tests and treatments. A scoring system called ROSIER (recognition of stroke in the emergency room) is recommended for this purpose; it is based on features from the medical history and physical examination.[41][42]
 Loss of consciousness, headache, and vomiting usually occur more often in hemorrhagic stroke than in thrombosis because of the increased intracranial pressure from the leaking blood compressing the brain.
 If symptoms are maximal at onset, the cause is more likely to be a subarachnoid hemorrhage or an embolic stroke.
 If the area of the brain affected includes one of the three prominent central nervous system pathways—the spinothalamic tract, corticospinal tract, and the dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway, symptoms may include:
 In most cases, the symptoms affect only one side of the body (unilateral). Depending on the part of the brain affected, the defect in the brain is usually on the opposite side of the body. However, since these pathways also travel in the spinal cord and any lesion there can also produce these symptoms, the presence of any one of these symptoms does not necessarily indicate stroke. In addition to the above central nervous system pathways, the brainstem gives rise to most of the twelve cranial nerves. A brainstem stroke affecting the brainstem and brain, therefore, can produce symptoms relating to deficits in these cranial nerves:[citation needed]
 If the cerebral cortex is involved, the central nervous system pathways can again be affected, but can also produce the following symptoms:
 If the cerebellum is involved, ataxia might be present and this includes:
 In the days before a stroke (generally in the previous 7 days, even the previous one), a considerable proportion of patients have a ""sentinel headache"": a severe and unusual headache that indicates a problem.[44] Its appearance makes it advisable to seek medical review and to consider prevention against stroke.
 In thrombotic stroke, a thrombus[45] (blood clot) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques. Since blockage of the artery is gradual, onset of symptomatic thrombotic stroke is slower than that of hemorrhagic stroke. A thrombus itself (even if it does not completely block the blood vessel) can lead to an embolic stroke (see below) if the thrombus breaks off and travels in the bloodstream, at which point it is called an embolus. Two types of thrombosis can cause stroke:
 Anemia causes increase blood flow in the blood circulatory system. This causes the endothelial cells of the blood vessels to express adhesion factors which encourages the clotting of blood and formation of thrombus.[50] Sickle-cell anemia, which can cause blood cells to clump up and block blood vessels, can also lead to stroke. Stroke is the second leading cause of death in people under 20 with sickle-cell anemia.[51] Air pollution may also increase stroke risk.[52]
 An embolic stroke refers to an arterial embolism (a blockage of an artery) by an embolus, a traveling particle or debris in the arterial bloodstream originating from elsewhere. An embolus is most frequently a thrombus, but it can also be a number of other substances including fat (e.g., from bone marrow in a broken bone), air, cancer cells or clumps of bacteria (usually from infectious endocarditis).[53]
 Because an embolus arises from elsewhere, local therapy solves the problem only temporarily. Thus, the source of the embolus must be identified. Because the embolic blockage is sudden in onset, symptoms are usually maximal at the start. Also, symptoms may be transient as the embolus is partially resorbed and moves to a different location or dissipates altogether.
 Emboli most commonly arise from the heart (especially in atrial fibrillation) but may originate from elsewhere in the arterial tree. In paradoxical embolism, a deep vein thrombosis embolizes through an atrial or ventricular septal defect in the heart into the brain.[53]
 Causes of stroke related to the heart can be distinguished between high- and low-risk:[54]
 Among those who have a complete blockage of one of the carotid arteries, the risk of stroke on that side is about one percent per year.[55]
 A special form of embolic stroke is the embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). This subset of cryptogenic stroke is defined as a non-lacunar brain infarct without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic sources. About one out of six cases of ischemic stroke could be classified as ESUS.[56]
 Cerebral hypoperfusion is the reduction of blood flow to all parts of the brain. The reduction could be to a particular part of the brain depending on the cause. It is most commonly due to heart failure from cardiac arrest or arrhythmias, or from reduced cardiac output as a result of myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion, or bleeding.[citation needed] Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen content) may precipitate the hypoperfusion. Because the reduction in blood flow is global, all parts of the brain may be affected, especially vulnerable ""watershed"" areas—border zone regions supplied by the major cerebral arteries. A watershed stroke refers to the condition when the blood supply to these areas is compromised. Blood flow to these areas does not necessarily stop, but instead it may lessen to the point where brain damage can occur.
 Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis leads to stroke due to locally increased venous pressure, which exceeds the pressure generated by the arteries. Infarcts are more likely to undergo hemorrhagic transformation (leaking of blood into the damaged area) than other types of ischemic stroke.[23]
 It generally occurs in small arteries or arterioles and is commonly due to hypertension,[57] intracranial vascular malformations (including cavernous angiomas or arteriovenous malformations), cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or infarcts into which secondary hemorrhage has occurred.[2] Other potential causes are trauma, bleeding disorders, amyloid angiopathy, illicit drug use (e.g., amphetamines or cocaine). The hematoma enlarges until pressure from surrounding tissue limits its growth, or until it decompresses by emptying into the ventricular system, CSF or the pial surface. A third of intracerebral bleed is into the brain's ventricles. ICH has a mortality rate of 44 percent after 30 days, higher than ischemic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage (which technically may also be classified as a type of stroke[2]).
 Other causes may include spasm of an artery. This may occur due to cocaine.[58]
 Silent stroke is stroke that does not have any outward symptoms, and people are typically unaware they had experienced stroke. Despite not causing identifiable symptoms, silent stroke still damages the brain and places the person at increased risk for both transient ischemic attack and major stroke in the future. Conversely, those who have had major stroke are also at risk of having silent stroke.[59] In a broad study in 1998, more than 11 million people were estimated to have experienced stroke in the United States. Approximately 770,000 of these were symptomatic and 11 million were first-ever silent MRI infarcts or hemorrhages. Silent stroke typically causes lesions which are detected via the use of neuroimaging such as MRI. Silent stroke is estimated to occur at five times the rate of symptomatic stroke.[60][61] The risk of silent stroke increases with age, but they may also affect younger adults and children, especially those with acute anemia.[60][62]
 Ischemic stroke occurs because of a loss of blood supply to part of the brain, initiating the ischemic cascade.[63] Atherosclerosis may disrupt the blood supply by narrowing the lumen of blood vessels leading to a reduction of blood flow by causing the formation of blood clots within the vessel or by releasing showers of small emboli through the disintegration of atherosclerotic plaques.[64] Embolic infarction occurs when emboli formed elsewhere in the circulatory system, typically in the heart as a consequence of atrial fibrillation, or in the carotid arteries, break off, enter the cerebral circulation, then lodge in and block brain blood vessels. Since blood vessels in the brain are now blocked, the brain becomes low in energy, and thus it resorts to using anaerobic metabolism within the region of brain tissue affected by ischemia. Anaerobic metabolism produces less adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but releases a by-product called lactic acid. Lactic acid is an irritant which could potentially destroy cells since it is an acid and disrupts the normal acid-base balance in the brain. The ischemia area is referred to as the ""ischemic penumbra"".[65] After the initial ischemic event the penumbra transitions from a tissue remodeling characterized by damage to a remodeling characterized by repair.[66]
 As oxygen or glucose becomes depleted in ischemic brain tissue, the production of high energy phosphate compounds such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) fails, leading to failure of energy-dependent processes (such as ion pumping) necessary for tissue cell survival. This sets off a series of interrelated events that result in cellular injury and death. A major cause of neuronal injury is the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. The concentration of glutamate outside the cells of the nervous system is normally kept low by so-called uptake carriers, which are powered by the concentration gradients of ions (mainly Na+) across the cell membrane. However, stroke cuts off the supply of oxygen and glucose which powers the ion pumps maintaining these gradients. As a result, the transmembrane ion gradients run down, and glutamate transporters reverse their direction, releasing glutamate into the extracellular space. Glutamate acts on receptors in nerve cells (especially NMDA receptors), producing an influx of calcium which activates enzymes that digest the cells' proteins, lipids, and nuclear material. Calcium influx can also lead to the failure of mitochondria, which can lead further toward energy depletion and may trigger cell death due to programmed cell death.[67]
 Ischemia also induces production of oxygen free radicals and other reactive oxygen species. These react with and damage a number of cellular and extracellular elements. Damage to the blood vessel lining or endothelium may occur. These processes are the same for any type of ischemic tissue and are referred to collectively as the ischemic cascade. However, brain tissue is especially vulnerable to ischemia since it has little respiratory reserve and is completely dependent on aerobic metabolism, unlike most other organs.
 The brain can compensate inadequate blood flow in a single artery by the collateral system. This system relies on the efficient connection between the carotid and vertebral arteries through the circle of Willis and, to a lesser extent, the major arteries supplying the cerebral hemispheres. However, variations in the circle of Willis, caliber of collateral vessels, and acquired arterial lesions such as atherosclerosis can disrupt this compensatory mechanism, increasing the risk of brain ischemia resulting from artery blockage.[68]
 The extent of damage depends on the duration and severity of the ischemia. If ischemia persists for more than 5 minutes with perfusion below 5% of normal, some neurons will die. However, if ischemia is mild, the damage will occur slowly and may take up to 6 hours to completely destroy the brain tissue. In case of severe ischemia lasting more than 15 to 30 minutes, all of the affected tissue will die, leading to infarction. The rate of damage is affected by temperature, with hyperthermia accelerating damage and hypothermia slowing it down and  other factors. Prompt restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissues can reduce or reverse injury, especially if the tissues are not yet irreversibly damaged. This is particularly important for the moderately ischemic areas (penumbras) surrounding areas of severe ischemia, which may still be salvageable due to collateral flow.[68][69][70]
 Hemorrhagic stroke is classified based on their underlying pathology. Some causes of hemorrhagic stroke are hypertensive hemorrhage, ruptured aneurysm, ruptured AV fistula, transformation of prior ischemic infarction, and drug-induced bleeding.[71] They result in tissue injury by causing compression of tissue from an expanding hematoma or hematomas. In addition, the pressure may lead to a loss of blood supply to affected tissue with resulting infarction, and the blood released by brain hemorrhage appears to have direct toxic effects on brain tissue and vasculature.[51][72] Inflammation contributes to the secondary brain injury after hemorrhage.[72]
 Stroke is diagnosed through several techniques: a neurological examination (such as the NIHSS), CT scans (most often without contrast enhancements) or MRI scans, Doppler ultrasound, and arteriography. The diagnosis of stroke itself is clinical, with assistance from the imaging techniques. Imaging techniques also assist in determining the subtypes and cause of stroke. There is yet no commonly used blood test for the stroke diagnosis itself, though blood tests may be of help in finding out the likely cause of stroke.[73] In deceased people, an autopsy of stroke may help establishing the time between stroke onset and death.
 A physical examination, including taking a medical history of the symptoms and a neurological status, helps giving an evaluation of the location and severity of stroke. It can give a standard score on e.g., the NIH stroke scale.
 For diagnosing ischemic (blockage) stroke in the emergency setting:[74]
 For diagnosing hemorrhagic stroke in the emergency setting:
 For detecting chronic hemorrhages, an MRI scan is more sensitive.[75]
 For the assessment of stable stroke, nuclear medicine scans such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET/CT) may be helpful. SPECT documents cerebral blood flow, whereas PET with an FDG isotope shows cerebral glucose metabolism.
 CT scans may not detect ischemic stroke, especially if it is small, of recent onset,[10] or in the brainstem or cerebellum areas (posterior circulation infarct). MRI is better at detecting a posterior circulation infarct with diffusion-weighted imaging.[76] A CT scan is used more to rule out certain stroke mimics and detect bleeding.[10] The presence of leptomeningeal collateral circulation in the brain is associated with better clinical outcomes after recanalization treatment.[77] Cerebrovascular reserve capacity is another factor that affects stroke outcome – it is the amount of increase in cerebral blood flow after a purposeful stimulation of blood flow by the physician, such as by giving inhaled carbon dioxide or intravenous acetazolamide. The increase in blood flow can be measured by PET scan or transcranial doppler sonography.[78] However, in people with obstruction of the internal carotid artery of one side, the presence of leptomeningeal collateral circulation is associated with reduced cerebral reserve capacity.[79]
 When stroke has been diagnosed, other studies may be performed to determine the underlying cause. With the treatment and diagnosis options available, it is of particular importance to determine whether there is a peripheral source of emboli. Test selection may vary since the cause of stroke varies with age, comorbidity and the clinical presentation. The following are commonly used techniques:
 For hemorrhagic stroke, a CT or MRI scan with intravascular contrast may be able to identify abnormalities in the brain arteries (such as aneurysms) or other sources of bleeding, and structural MRI if this shows no cause. If this too does not identify an underlying reason for the bleeding, invasive cerebral angiography could be performed but this requires access to the bloodstream with an intravascular catheter and can cause further stroke as well as complications at the insertion site and this investigation is therefore reserved for specific situations.[80] If there are symptoms suggesting that the hemorrhage might have occurred as a result of venous thrombosis, CT or MRI venography can be used to examine the cerebral veins.[80]
 Among people with ischemic stroke, misdiagnosis occurs 2 to 26% of the time.[81] A ""stroke chameleon"" (SC) is stroke which is diagnosed as something else.[81][82]
 People not having stroke may also be misdiagnosed with the condition. Giving thrombolytics (clot-busting) in such cases causes intracerebral bleeding 1 to 2% of the time, which is less than that of people with stroke. This unnecessary treatment adds to health care costs. Even so, the AHA/ASA guidelines state that starting intravenous tPA in possible mimics is preferred to delaying treatment for additional testing.[81]
 Women, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian and Pacific Islanders are more often misdiagnosed for a condition other than stroke when in fact having stroke. In addition, adults under 44 years of age are seven times more likely to have stroke missed than are adults over 75 years of age. This is especially the case for younger people with posterior circulation infarcts.[81] Some medical centers have used hyperacute MRI in experimental studies for people initially thought to have a low likelihood of stroke, and in some of these people, stroke has been found which were then treated with thrombolytic medication.[81]
 Given the disease burden of stroke, prevention is an important public health concern.[83] Primary prevention is less effective than secondary prevention (as judged by the number needed to treat to prevent one stroke per year).[83] Recent guidelines detail the evidence for primary prevention in stroke.[84] About the use of aspirin as a preventive medication for stroke, in healthy people aspirin does not appear beneficial and thus is not recommended,[85]  but in people with high cardiovascular risk, or those who have had a myocardial infarction, it provides some protection against a first stroke.[86][87] In those who have previously had stroke, treatment with medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole may be beneficial.[86] The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening for carotid artery stenosis in those without symptoms.[88]
 The most important modifiable risk factors for stroke are high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation, although the size of the effect is small; 833 people have to be treated for 1 year to prevent one stroke.[89][90] Other modifiable risk factors include high blood cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, end-stage kidney disease,[8] cigarette smoking[91][92] (active and passive), heavy alcohol use,[93] drug use,[94] lack of physical activity, obesity, processed red meat consumption,[95] and unhealthy diet.[96] Smoking just one cigarette per day increases the risk more than 30%.[97] Alcohol use could predispose to ischemic stroke, as well as intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage via multiple mechanisms (for example, via hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rebound thrombocytosis and platelet aggregation and clotting disturbances).[98] Drugs, most commonly amphetamines and cocaine, can induce stroke through damage to the blood vessels in the brain and acute hypertension.[71][99] Migraine with aura doubles a person's risk for ischemic stroke.[100][101] Untreated, celiac disease regardless of the presence of symptoms can be an underlying cause of stroke, both in children and adults.[102] According to a 2021 WHO study, working 55+ hours a week raises the risk of stroke by 35% and the risk of dying from heart conditions by 17%, when compared to a 35-40-hour week.[103]
 High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of stroke by about 26%.[104] There is a lack of high quality studies looking at promotional efforts to improve lifestyle factors.[105] Nonetheless, given the large body of circumstantial evidence, best medical management for stroke includes advice on diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol use.[106] Medication is the most common method of stroke prevention; carotid endarterectomy can be a useful surgical method of preventing stroke.
 High blood pressure accounts for 35–50% of stroke risk.[107] Blood pressure reduction of 10 mmHg systolic or 5 mmHg diastolic reduces the risk of stroke by ~40%.[108] Lowering blood pressure has been conclusively shown to prevent both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.[109][110] It is equally important in secondary prevention.[111] Even people older than 80 years and those with isolated systolic hypertension benefit from antihypertensive therapy.[112][113][114] The available evidence does not show large differences in stroke prevention between antihypertensive drugs—therefore, other factors such as protection against other forms of cardiovascular disease and cost should be considered.[115][116] The routine use of beta-blockers following stroke or TIA has not been shown to result in benefits.[117]
 High cholesterol levels have been inconsistently associated with (ischemic) stroke.[110][118] Statins have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke by about 15%.[119] Since earlier meta-analyses of other lipid-lowering drugs did not show a decreased risk,[120] statins might exert their effect through mechanisms other than their lipid-lowering effects.[119]
 Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of stroke by 2 to 3 times.[clarification needed][citation needed] While intensive blood sugar control has been shown to reduce small blood vessel complications such as kidney damage and damage to the retina of the eye it has not been shown to reduce large blood vessel complications such as stroke.[121][122]
 Oral anticoagulants such as warfarin have been the mainstay of stroke prevention for over 50 years. However, several studies have shown that aspirin and other antiplatelets are highly effective in secondary prevention after stroke or transient ischemic attack.[86] Low doses of aspirin (for example 75–150 mg) are as effective as high doses but have fewer side effects; the lowest effective dose remains unknown.[123] Thienopyridines (clopidogrel, ticlopidine) might be slightly more effective than aspirin and have a decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding but are more expensive.[124] Both aspirin and clopidogrel may be useful in the first few weeks after a minor stroke or high-risk TIA.[125] Clopidogrel has less side effects than ticlopidine.[124] Dipyridamole can be added to aspirin therapy to provide a small additional benefit, even though headache is a common side effect.[126] Low-dose aspirin is also effective for stroke prevention after having a myocardial infarction.[87]
 Those with atrial fibrillation have a 5% a year risk of stroke, and those with valvular atrial fibrillation have an even higher risk.[127] Depending on the stroke risk, anticoagulation with medications such as warfarin or aspirin is useful for prevention with various levels of comparative effectiveness depending on the type of treatment used.[128][129]
 Oral anticoagulants, especially Xa (apixaban) and thrombin (dabigatran) inhibitors, have been shown to be superior to warfarin in stroke reduction and have a lower or similar bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.[129] Except in people with atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulants are not advised for stroke prevention—any benefit is offset by bleeding risk.[130]
 In primary prevention, however, antiplatelet drugs did not reduce the risk of ischemic stroke but increased the risk of major bleeding.[131][132] Further studies are needed to investigate a possible protective effect of aspirin against ischemic stroke in women.[133][134]
 Carotid endarterectomy or carotid angioplasty can be used to remove atherosclerotic narrowing of the carotid artery. There is evidence supporting this procedure in selected cases.[106] Endarterectomy for a significant stenosis has been shown to be useful in preventing further stroke in those who have already had the condition.[135] Carotid artery stenting has not been shown to be equally useful.[136][137] People are selected for surgery based on age, gender, degree of stenosis, time since symptoms and the person's preferences.[106] Surgery is most efficient when not delayed too long—the risk of recurrent stroke in a person who has a 50% or greater stenosis is up to 20% after 5 years, but endarterectomy reduces this risk to around 5%. The number of procedures needed to cure one person was 5 for early surgery (within two weeks after the initial stroke), but 125 if delayed longer than 12 weeks.[138][139]
 Screening for carotid artery narrowing has not been shown to be a useful test in the general population.[140] Studies of surgical intervention for carotid artery stenosis without symptoms have shown only a small decrease in the risk of stroke.[141][142] To be beneficial, the complication rate of the surgery should be kept below 4%. Even then, for 100 surgeries, 5 people will benefit by avoiding stroke, 3 will develop stroke despite surgery, 3 will develop stroke or die due to the surgery itself, and 89 will remain stroke-free but would also have done so without intervention.[106]
 Nutrition, specifically the Mediterranean-style diet, has the potential to decrease the risk of having a stroke by more than half.[143] It does not appear that lowering levels of homocysteine with folic acid affects the risk of stroke.[144][145]
 A number of specific recommendations have been made for women including taking aspirin after the 11th week of pregnancy if there is a history of previous chronic high blood pressure and taking blood pressure medications during pregnancy if the blood pressure is greater than 150 mmHg systolic or greater than 100 mmHg diastolic. In those who have previously had preeclampsia, other risk factors should be treated more aggressively.[146]
 Keeping blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg is recommended.[147] Anticoagulation can prevent recurrent ischemic stroke. Among people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation can reduce stroke by 60% while antiplatelet agents can reduce stroke by 20%.[148] However, a recent meta-analysis suggests harm from anticoagulation started early after an embolic stroke.[149][150] Stroke prevention treatment for atrial fibrillation is determined according to the CHA2DS2–VASc score. The most widely used anticoagulant to prevent thromboembolic stroke in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the oral agent warfarin while a number of newer agents including dabigatran are alternatives which do not require prothrombin time monitoring.[147]
 Anticoagulants, when used following stroke, should not be stopped for dental procedures.[151]
 If studies show carotid artery stenosis, and the person has a degree of residual function on the affected side, carotid endarterectomy (surgical removal of the stenosis) may decrease the risk of recurrence if performed rapidly after stroke.
 Stroke, whether ischemic or hemorrhagic, is an emergency that warrants immediate medical attention.[5][152] The specific treatment will depend on the type of stroke, the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms, and the underlying cause or presence of comorbidities.[152]
 Aspirin reduces the overall risk of recurrence by 13% with greater benefit early on.[153] Definitive therapy within the first few hours is aimed at removing the blockage by breaking the clot down (thrombolysis), or by removing it mechanically (thrombectomy). The philosophical premise underlying the importance of rapid stroke intervention was summed up as Time is Brain! in the early 1990s.[154] Years later, that same idea, that rapid cerebral blood flow restoration results in fewer brain cells dying, has been proved and quantified.[155]
 Tight blood sugar control in the first few hours does not improve outcomes and may cause harm.[156] High blood pressure is also not typically lowered as this has not been found to be helpful.[157][158] Cerebrolysin, a mixture of pig brain-derived neurotrophic factors used widely to treat acute ischemic stroke in China, Eastern Europe, Russia, post-Soviet countries, and other Asian countries, does not improve outcomes or prevent death and may increase the risk of severe adverse events.[159] There is also no evidence that cerebrolysin‐like peptide mixtures which are extracted from cattle brain is helpful in treating acute ischemic stroke.[159]
 Thrombolysis, such as with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), in acute ischemic stroke, when given within three hours of symptom onset, results in an overall benefit of 10% with respect to living without disability.[160][161] It does not, however, improve chances of survival.[160] Benefit is greater the earlier it is used.[160] Between three and four and a half hours the effects are less clear.[162][163][164] The AHA/ASA recommend it for certain people in this time frame.[165] A 2014 review found a 5% increase in the number of people living without disability at three to six months; however, there was a 2% increased risk of death in the short term.[161] After four and a half hours thrombolysis worsens outcomes.[162] These benefits or lack of benefits occurred regardless of the age of the person treated.[166] There is no reliable way to determine who will have an intracranial bleed post-treatment versus who will not.[167] In those with findings of savable tissue on medical imaging between 4.5 hours and 9 hours or who wake up with stroke, alteplase results in some benefit.[168]
 Its use is endorsed by the American Heart Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Neurology as the recommended treatment for acute stroke within three hours of onset of symptoms as long as there are no other contraindications (such as abnormal lab values, high blood pressure, or recent surgery). This position for tPA is based upon the findings of two studies by one group of investigators[169] which showed that tPA improves the chances for a good neurological outcome. When administered within the first three hours thrombolysis improves functional outcome without affecting mortality.[170] 6.4% of people with large stroke developed substantial brain bleeding as a complication from being given tPA thus part of the reason for increased short term mortality.[171] The American Academy of Emergency Medicine had previously stated that objective evidence regarding the applicability of tPA for acute ischemic stroke was insufficient.[172] In 2013 the American College of Emergency Medicine refuted this position,[173] acknowledging the body of evidence for the use of tPA in ischemic stroke;[174] but debate continues.[175][176] Intra-arterial fibrinolysis, where a catheter is passed up an artery into the brain and the medication is injected at the site of thrombosis, has been found to improve outcomes in people with acute ischemic stroke.[177]
 Mechanical removal of the blood clot causing the ischemic stroke, called mechanical thrombectomy, is a potential treatment for occlusion of a large artery, such as the middle cerebral artery. In 2015, one review demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this procedure if performed within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms.[178][179] It did not change the risk of death but did reduce disability compared to the use of intravenous thrombolysis, which is generally used in people evaluated for mechanical thrombectomy.[180][181] Certain cases may benefit from thrombectomy up to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms.[182]
 Stroke affecting large portions of the brain can cause significant brain swelling with secondary brain injury in surrounding tissue. This phenomenon is mainly encountered in stroke affecting brain tissue dependent upon the middle cerebral artery for blood supply and is also called ""malignant cerebral infarction"" because it carries a dismal prognosis. Relief of the pressure may be attempted with medication, but some require hemicraniectomy, the temporary surgical removal of the skull on one side of the head. This decreases the risk of death, although some people – who would otherwise have died – survive with disability.[183][184]
 People with intracerebral hemorrhage require supportive care, including blood pressure control if required. People are monitored for changes in the level of consciousness, and their blood sugar and oxygenation are kept at optimum levels. Anticoagulants and antithrombotics can make bleeding worse and are generally discontinued (and reversed if possible).[citation needed] A proportion may benefit from neurosurgical intervention to remove the blood and treat the underlying cause, but this depends on the location and the size of the hemorrhage as well as patient-related factors, and ongoing research is being conducted into the question as to which people with intracerebral hemorrhage may benefit.[185]
 In subarachnoid hemorrhage, early treatment for underlying cerebral aneurysms may reduce the risk of further hemorrhages. Depending on the site of the aneurysm this may be by surgery that involves opening the skull or endovascularly (through the blood vessels).[186]
 Ideally, people who have had stroke are admitted to a ""stroke unit"", a ward or dedicated area in a hospital staffed by nurses and therapists with experience in stroke treatment. It has been shown that people admitted to stroke units have a higher chance of surviving than those admitted elsewhere in hospital, even if they are being cared for by doctors without experience in stroke.[2][187] Nursing care is fundamental in maintaining skin care, feeding, hydration, positioning, and monitoring vital signs such as temperature, pulse, and blood pressure.[188]
 Stroke rehabilitation is the process by which those with disabling stroke undergo treatment to help them return to normal life as much as possible by regaining and relearning the skills of everyday living. It also aims to help the survivor understand and adapt to difficulties, prevent secondary complications, and educate family members to play a supporting role. Stroke rehabilitation should begin almost immediately with a multidisciplinary approach. The rehabilitation team may involve physicians trained in rehabilitation medicine, neurologists, clinical pharmacists, nursing staff, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, and orthotists. Some teams may also include psychologists and social workers, since at least one-third of affected people manifests post stroke depression. Validated instruments such as the Barthel scale may be used to assess the likelihood of a person who has had stroke being able to manage at home with or without support subsequent to discharge from a hospital.[189]
 Stroke rehabilitation should be started as quickly as possible and can last anywhere from a few days to over a year. Most return of function is seen in the first few months, and then improvement falls off with the ""window"" considered officially by U.S. state rehabilitation units and others to be closed after six months, with little chance of further improvement.[medical citation needed] However, some people have reported that they continue to improve for years, regaining and strengthening abilities like writing, walking, running, and talking.[medical citation needed] Daily rehabilitation exercises should continue to be part of the daily routine for people who have had stroke. Complete recovery is unusual but not impossible and most people will improve to some extent: proper diet and exercise are known to help the brain to recover.
 The body of evidence is uncertain on the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation for reducing the disabling effects of neglect and increasing independence remains unproven.[190] However, there is limited evidence that cognitive rehabilitation may have an immediate beneficial effect on tests of neglect.[190] Overall, no rehabilitation approach can be supported by evidence for spatial neglect.
 The body of evidence is uncertain whether the use of rehabilitation can improve on-road driving skills following stroke.[191] There is limited evidence that training on a driving simulator will improve performance on recognizing road signs after training.[191] The findings are based on low-quality evidence as further research is needed involving large numbers of participants.
 Based on low quality evidence, it is uncertain whether yoga has a significant benefit for stroke rehabilitation on measures of quality of life, balance, strength, endurance, pain, and disability scores.[192] Yoga may reduce anxiety and could be included as part of patient-centred stroke rehabilitation.[192] Further research is needed assessing the benefits and safety of yoga in stroke rehabilitation.
 Low-quality evidence suggests that action observation (a type of physiotherapy that is meant to improve neural plasticity through the mirror-neuronal system) may be of some benefit and has no significant adverse effects, however this benefit may not be clinically significant and further research is suggested.[193]
 The body of scientific evidence is uncertain on the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for attention deficits in patients following stroke.[194] While there may be an immediate effect after treatment on attention, the findings are based on low to moderate quality and small number of studies.[194] Further research is needed to assess whether the effect can be sustained in day-to-day tasks requiring attention.
 The latest evidence supports the short-term benefits of motor imagery (MI) on walking speed in individuals who have had stroke, in comparison to other therapies.[195] MI does not improve motor function after stroke and does not seem to cause significant adverse events.[195] The findings are based on low-quality evidence as further research is needed to estimate the effect of MI on walking endurance and the dependence on personal assistance.
 Physical and occupational therapy have overlapping areas of expertise; however, physical therapy focuses on joint range of motion and strength by performing exercises and relearning functional tasks such as bed mobility, transferring, walking and other gross motor functions. Physiotherapists can also work with people who have had stroke to improve awareness and use of the hemiplegic side. Rehabilitation involves working on the ability to produce strong movements or the ability to perform tasks using normal patterns. Emphasis is often concentrated on functional tasks and people's goals. One example physiotherapists employ to promote motor learning involves constraint-induced movement therapy. Through continuous practice the person relearns to use and adapt the hemiplegic limb during functional activities to create lasting permanent changes.[196] Physical therapy is effective for recovery of function and mobility after stroke.[197] Occupational therapy is involved in training to help relearn everyday activities known as the activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and toileting. Approaches to helping people with urinary incontinence include physical therapy, cognitive therapy, and specialized interventions with experienced medical professionals, however, it is not clear how effective these approaches are at improving urinary incontinence following stroke.[198]
 Treatment of spasticity related to stroke often involves early mobilizations, commonly performed by a physiotherapist, combined with elongation of spastic muscles and sustained stretching through different positions.[43] Gaining initial improvement in range of motion is often achieved through rhythmic rotational patterns associated with the affected limb.[43] After full range has been achieved by the therapist, the limb should be positioned in the lengthened positions to prevent against further contractures, skin breakdown, and disuse of the limb with the use of splints or other tools to stabilize the joint.[43] Cold ice wraps or ice packs may briefly relieve spasticity by temporarily reducing neural firing rates.[43] Electrical stimulation to the antagonist muscles or vibrations has also been used with some success.[43] Physical therapy is sometimes suggested for people who experience sexual dysfunction following stroke.[199]
 With the prevalence of vision problems increasing with age in stroke patients, the overall effect of interventions for age-related visual problems is uncertain. It is also not sure whether people with stroke respond differently from the general population when treating eye problems.[200] Further research in this area is needed as the body of evidence is very low quality.
 Speech and language therapy is appropriate for people with the speech production disorders: dysarthria[201] and apraxia of speech,[202] aphasia,[203] cognitive-communication impairments, and problems with swallowing. 
 Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke improves functional communication, reading, writing and expressive language. Speech and language therapy that is higher intensity, higher dose or provided over a long duration of time leads to significantly better functional communication but people might be more likely to drop out of high intensity treatment (up to 15 hours per week).[204] A total of 20-50 hours of speech and language therapy is necessary for the best recovery. The most improvement happens when 2-5 hours of therapy is provided each week over 4-5 days. Recovery is further improved when besides the therapy people practice tasks at home.[205][206] Speech and language therapy is also effective if it is delivered online through video or by a family member who has been trained by a professional therapist.[205][206]
 Recovery with therapy for aphasia is also dependent on the recency of stroke and the age of the person. Receiving therapy within a month after the stroke leads to the greatest improvements. 3 or 6 months after the stroke more therapy will be needed but symptoms can still be improved. People with aphasia who are younger than 55 years are the most likely to improve but people older than 75 years can still get better with therapy.[207][208]
 People who have had stroke may have particular problems, such as dysphagia, which can cause swallowed material to pass into the lungs and cause aspiration pneumonia. The condition may improve with time, but in the interim, a nasogastric tube may be inserted, enabling liquid food to be given directly into the stomach. If swallowing is still deemed unsafe, then a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is passed and this can remain indefinitely. Swallowing therapy has mixed results as of 2018.[209]
 Often, assistive technology such as wheelchairs, walkers and canes may be beneficial. Many mobility problems can be improved by the use of ankle foot orthoses.[210]
 Stroke can also reduce people's general fitness.[211] Reduced fitness can reduce capacity for rehabilitation as well as general health.[212] Physical exercises as part of a rehabilitation program following stroke appear safe.[211] Cardiorespiratory fitness training that involves walking in rehabilitation can improve speed, tolerance and independence during walking, and may improve balance.[211] There are inadequate long-term data about the effects of exercise and training on death, dependence and disability after stroke.[211] The future areas of research may concentrate on the optimal exercise prescription and long-term health benefits of exercise. The effect of physical training on cognition also may be studied further.
 The ability to walk independently in their community, indoors or outdoors, is important following stroke. Although no negative effects have been reported, it is unclear if outcomes can improve with these walking programs when compared to usual treatment.[213]
 Some current and future therapy methods include the use of virtual reality and video games for rehabilitation. These forms of rehabilitation offer potential for motivating people to perform specific therapy tasks that many other forms do not.[214] While virtual reality and interactive video gaming are not more effective than conventional therapy for improving upper limb function, when used in conjunction with usual care these approaches may improve upper limb function and ADL function.[215] There are inadequate data on the effect of virtual reality and interactive video gaming on gait speed, balance, participation and quality of life.[215] Many clinics and hospitals are adopting the use of these off-the-shelf devices for exercise, social interaction, and rehabilitation because they are affordable, accessible and can be used within the clinic and home.[214]
 Mirror therapy is associated with improved motor function of the upper extremity in people who have had stroke.[216]
 Other non-invasive rehabilitation methods used to augment physical therapy of motor function in people recovering from stroke include transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct-current stimulation.[217] and robotic therapies.[218] Constraint‐induced movement therapy (CIMT), mental practice, mirror therapy, interventions for sensory impairment, virtual reality and a relatively high dose of repetitive task practice may be effective in improving upper limb function. However, further primary research, specifically of CIMT, mental practice, mirror therapy and virtual reality is needed.[219]
 Clinical studies confirm the importance of orthoses in stroke rehabilitation.[220][221][222] The orthosis supports the therapeutic applications and also helps to mobilize the patient at an early stage. With the help of an orthosis, physiological standing and walking can be learned again, and late health consequences caused by a wrong gait pattern can be prevented. A treatment with an orthosis can therefore be used to support the therapy.
 Stroke can affect the ability to live independently and with quality. Self-management programs are a special training that educates stroke survivors about stroke and its consequences, helps them acquire skills to cope with their challenges, and helps them set and meet their own goals during their recovery process. These programs are tailored to the target audience, and led by someone trained and expert in stroke and its consequences (most commonly professionals, but also stroke survivors and peers). A 2016 review reported that these programs improve the quality of life after stroke, without negative effects. People with stroke felt more empowered, happy and satisfied with life after participating in this training.[223]
 Disability affects 75% of stroke survivors enough to decrease their ability to work.[224]
Stroke can affect people physically, mentally, emotionally, or a combination of the three. The results of stroke vary widely depending on size and location of the lesion.[225]
 Some of the physical disabilities that can result from stroke include muscle weakness, numbness, pressure sores, pneumonia, incontinence, apraxia (inability to perform learned movements), difficulties carrying out daily activities, appetite loss, speech loss, vision loss and pain. If the stroke is severe enough, or in a certain location such as parts of the brainstem, coma or death can result. Up to 10% of people following stroke develop seizures, most commonly in the week subsequent to the event; the severity of the stroke increases the likelihood of a seizure.[226][227] An estimated 15% of people experience urinary incontinence for more than a year following stroke.[198] 50% of people have a decline in sexual function (sexual dysfunction) following stroke.[199]
 Emotional and mental dysfunctions correspond to areas in the brain that have been damaged. Emotional problems following stroke can be due to direct damage to emotional centers in the brain or from frustration and difficulty adapting to new limitations. Post-stroke emotional difficulties include anxiety, panic attacks, flat affect (failure to express emotions), mania, apathy and psychosis. Other difficulties may include a decreased ability to communicate emotions through facial expression, body language and voice.[228]
 Disruption in self-identity, relationships with others, and emotional well-being can lead to social consequences after stroke due to the lack of ability to communicate. Many people who experience communication impairments after stroke find it more difficult to cope with the social issues rather than physical impairments. Broader aspects of care must address the emotional impact speech impairment has on those who experience difficulties with speech after stroke.[201] Those who experience a stroke are at risk of paralysis, which could result in a self-disturbed body image, which may also lead to other social issues.[229]
 30 to 50% of stroke survivors develop post-stroke depression, which is characterized by lethargy, irritability, sleep disturbances, lowered self-esteem and withdrawal.[230] Depression can reduce motivation and worsen outcome, but can be treated with social and family support, psychotherapy and, in severe cases, antidepressants. Psychotherapy sessions may have a small effect on improving mood and preventing depression after stroke.[231] Antidepressant medications may be useful for treating depression after stroke but are associated with central nervous system and gastrointestinal adverse events.[231]
 Emotional lability, another consequence of stroke, causes the person to switch quickly between emotional highs and lows and to express emotions inappropriately, for instance with an excess of laughing or crying with little or no provocation. While these expressions of emotion usually correspond to the person's actual emotions, a more severe form of emotional lability causes the affected person to laugh and cry pathologically, without regard to context or emotion.[224] Some people show the opposite of what they feel, for example crying when they are happy.[232] Emotional lability occurs in about 20% of those who have had stroke. Those with a right hemisphere stroke are more likely to have empathy problems which can make communication harder.[233]
 Cognitive deficits resulting from stroke include perceptual disorders, aphasia,[234] dementia,[235][236] and problems with attention[237] and memory.[238] Stroke survivors may be unaware of their own disabilities, a condition called anosognosia. In a condition called hemispatial neglect, the affected person is unable to attend to anything on the side of space opposite to the damaged hemisphere. Cognitive and psychological outcome after stroke can be affected by the age at which the stroke happened, pre-stroke baseline intellectual functioning, psychiatric history and whether there is pre-existing brain pathology.[239]
 Stroke was the second most frequent cause of death worldwide in 2011, accounting for 6.2 million deaths (~11% of the total).[241] Approximately 17 million people had stroke in 2010 and 33 million people have previously had stroke and were still alive.[18] Between 1990 and 2010 the incidence of stroke decreased by approximately 10% in the developed world and increased by 10% in the developing world.[18] Overall, two-thirds of stroke occurred in those over 65 years old.[18] South Asians are at particularly high risk of stroke, accounting for 40% of global stroke deaths.[242] Incidence of ischemic stroke is ten times more frequent than haemorrhagic stroke.[243]
 It is ranked after heart disease and before cancer.[2] In the United States stroke is a leading cause of disability, and recently declined from the third leading to the fourth leading cause of death.[244] Geographic disparities in stroke incidence have been observed, including the existence of a ""stroke belt"" in the southeastern United States, but causes of these disparities have not been explained.
 The risk of stroke increases exponentially from 30 years of age, and the cause varies by age.[245] Advanced age is one of the most significant stroke risk factors. 95% of stroke occurs in people age 45 and older, and two-thirds of stroke occurs in those over the age of 65.[51][230]
 A person's risk of dying if he or she does have stroke also increases with age. However, stroke can occur at any age, including in childhood.[citation needed]
 Family members may have a genetic tendency for stroke or share a lifestyle that contributes to stroke. Higher levels of Von Willebrand factor are more common amongst people who have had ischemic stroke for the first time.[246] The results of this study found that the only significant genetic factor was the person's blood type. Having stroke in the past greatly increases one's risk of future stroke.
 Men are 25% more likely to develop stroke than women,[51] yet 60% of deaths from stroke occur in women.[232] Since women live longer, they are older on average when they have stroke and thus more often killed.[51] Some risk factors for stroke apply only to women. Primary among these are pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and the treatment thereof (HRT).
 Episodes of stroke and familial stroke have been reported from the 2nd millennium BC onward in ancient Mesopotamia and Persia.[247] Hippocrates (460 to 370 BC) was first to describe the phenomenon of sudden paralysis that is often associated with ischemia. Apoplexy, from the Greek word meaning ""struck down with violence"", first appeared in Hippocratic writings to describe this phenomenon.[248][249]
The word stroke was used as a synonym for apoplectic seizure as early as 1599,[250] and is a fairly literal translation of the Greek term. The term apoplectic stroke is an archaic, nonspecific term, for a cerebrovascular accident accompanied by haemorrhage or haemorrhagic stroke.[251] Martin Luther was described as having an apoplectic stroke that deprived him of his speech shortly before his death in 1546.[252]
 In 1658, in his Apoplexia, Johann Jacob Wepfer (1620–1695) identified the cause of hemorrhagic stroke when he suggested that people who had died of apoplexy had bleeding in their brains.[51][248]
Wepfer also identified the main arteries supplying the brain, the vertebral and carotid arteries, and identified the cause of a type of ischemic stroke known as a cerebral infarction when he suggested that apoplexy might be caused by a blockage to those vessels.[51] Rudolf Virchow first described the mechanism of thromboembolism as a major factor.[253]
 The term cerebrovascular accident was introduced in 1927, reflecting a ""growing awareness and acceptance of vascular theories and (...) recognition of the consequences of a sudden disruption in the vascular supply of the brain"".[254] Its use is now discouraged by a number of neurology textbooks, reasoning that the connotation of fortuitousness carried by the word accident insufficiently highlights the modifiability of the underlying risk factors.[255][256][257] Cerebrovascular insult may be used interchangeably.[258]
 The term brain attack was introduced for use to underline the acute nature of stroke according to the American Stroke Association,[258] which has used the term since 1990,[259] and is used colloquially to refer to both ischemic as well as hemorrhagic stroke.[260]
 As of 2017, angioplasty and stents were under preliminary clinical research to determine the possible therapeutic advantages of these procedures in comparison to therapy with statins, antithrombotics, or antihypertensive drugs.[261]

"A stroke is a disruption of blood flow to a part of your brain. Symptoms can come on quickly and without warning. Recognizing stroke symptoms and seeking treatment quickly can lead to a better outcome. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and bleeds or when there’s a blockage in the blood supply to the brain. The rupture or blockage prevents blood and oxygen from reaching the brain’s tissues. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. Every year, more than 795,000 U.S. people have a stroke. Without oxygen, brain cells and tissue become damaged and begin to die within minutes. It’s important to be able to recognize the symptoms of a stroke and to seek a speedy diagnosis and treatment. The loss of blood flow to the brain damages tissues within the brain. Symptoms of a stroke show up in the body parts controlled by the damaged areas of the brain. The sooner a person having a stroke gets care, the better their outcome is likely to be. For this reason, it’s helpful to know the signs of a stroke so you can act quickly. Stroke symptoms can include: Recognizing the symptoms of a stroke in someone can play an important role in improving their outcome. Experts recommend you BE-FAST: Prompt treatment is key to preventing brain damage, long-term disability, or death. It’s better to be overly cautious when dealing with a stroke, so don’t be afraid to get emergency medical help if you think you recognize the signs of a stroke. The cause of a stroke depends on the type of stroke. Strokes fall into three main categories:  The type of stroke you have affects your treatment and recovery process. During an ischemic stroke, the arteries supplying blood to the brain narrow or become blocked. Blood clots or severely reduced blood flow to the brain cause these blockages. Pieces of plaque breaking off and blocking a blood vessel can also cause them. Two types of blockages can lead to ischemic stroke: According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), 87% of strokes are ischemic.  A hemorrhagic stroke happens when an artery in the brain breaks open or leaks blood. The blood from that artery creates excess pressure in the skull and swells the brain, damaging brain cells and tissues. Doctors categorize hemorrhagic strokes into two primary types: The NHLBI states that 10% of strokes are ICH, while 3% are SAH. A TIA, or ministroke, occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked temporarily. Symptoms are similar to those of a full stroke. However, they typically disappear after a few minutes or hours when the blockage moves and blood flow is restored. A blood clot usually causes a TIA. While it’s not technically a full stroke, a TIA serves as a warning that an actual stroke may happen. Because of this, it’s best not to ignore it. Seek the same treatment you would for a major stroke and get emergency medical help. According to the American Stroke Association, close to 1 in 5 people with a TIA will have a full stroke within 3 months.

Some of these complications include:  While you may be able to overcome some complications after time, some may be permanent. Read more: “What Are the Potential Complications of Stroke?” The NHLBI estimates that 82% to 90% of strokes are preventable. While lifestyle changes can’t prevent all strokes, many of these changes can make a significant difference in lowering your risk. Experts recommend you consider the following: Read more: “10 Ways to Lower Your Risk of and Prevent Stroke” To diagnose stroke, a doctor will first ask you or a family member about your symptoms and what you were doing when they arose. They’ll take your medical history to find out your stroke risk factors.

These tests can help them determine whether you had a stroke and, if so: Read more: “What Tests Can Diagnose a Stroke?” Proper medical evaluation and prompt treatment are vital to recovering from a stroke. Treatment will depend on the type of stroke. Since a blood clot or blockage in the brain causes these stroke types, doctors essentially treat them with similar techniques. They can include: Strokes caused by bleeds or leaks in the brain require different treatment strategies. Treatments for hemorrhagic stroke include: In addition to emergency treatment, your healthcare team will advise you on ways to prevent future strokes.

The type of medication your doctor prescribes depends largely on the type of stroke you had. Common stroke medications include: Read more: “Stroke Drugs” Stroke is a leading cause of disability in the United States. While some people will fully recover, many will have long-term disabilities. It’s important that recovery and rehabilitation from a stroke start as soon as possible. In fact, stroke recovery should begin in the hospital. In a hospital, a care team can stabilize your condition and assess the effects of the stroke. They can identify underlying factors and begin therapy to help you regain some of your affected skills. Stroke recovery typically focuses on four main areas: Read more: “Stroke Recovery: What to Expect” If you suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of a stroke, it’s vital you seek emergency medical treatment as soon as possible. Healthcare professionals can only provide clot-busting medication in the first few hours after the signs of a stroke begin. Early treatment is one of the most effective ways to reduce your risk of long-term complications and disability. While it’s not always possible to completely prevent a stroke, certain lifestyle changes can significantly reduce your risk. Medications can also help reduce the risk of blood clots, which can lead to stroke. If your doctor believes you might be at risk of stroke, they will work with you to find a prevention strategy that works for you, including medical intervention and lifestyle changes.

 Tuberculosis (TB) is an infection that usually affects the lungs. It can be treated with antibiotics but can be serious if not treated. There's a vaccine that helps protect some people who are at risk from TB. Symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) usually come on gradually. Common symptoms include: Children may also have difficulty gaining weight or growing. If TB has spread to another part of your body such as your glands (lymph nodes), bones or brain, you may also have other symptoms, including: Sometimes you can have TB in your body but have no symptoms. This is called latent TB. If you have TB and you have symptoms, it's called active TB. You can call 111 or get help from 111 online. These could be signs that tuberculosis (TB) has spread to your brain (meningitis). Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you. If you have symptoms of tuberculosis (TB), tests you may have include: If you have no symptoms but are at risk from TB (for example, you've been in close contact with someone who has TB) you may have a Mantoux test or blood tests to check if you have it. A Mantoux test is a skin test where a small amount of liquid is injected under the skin in your arm. This liquid will cause a small reaction on your skin if you have TB. The main treatment for tuberculosis (TB) is to take antibiotics for at least 6 months. If TB has spread to your brain, spinal cord or the area around your heart, you may also need to take steroid medicine for a few weeks. If you have TB but do not have symptoms (latent TB) you usually need to take antibiotics for 3 to 6 months. It's important to take your antibiotics correctly and until you've completed the course, even if you feel better. If you stop your treatment early, TB could come back. Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria. It can spread through close contact with people who have TB and have symptoms (active TB). When someone with active TB coughs, they release small droplets containing the bacteria. You can catch TB if you regularly breathe in these droplets over a long period of time. Some people have TB in their body but do not get ill or have any symptoms (latent TB). This type of TB cannot be spread to others, but it can turn into active TB in the future. Anyone can get TB, but some people are more likely to get it or get more seriously ill from it, including people who: There is a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) called the BCG vaccine. It's recommended for some people who are at higher risk of catching TB or getting seriously ill from it, including: Find out more about the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis (TB)

"Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious illness that mainly affects the lungs. The germs that cause tuberculosis are a type of bacteria. Tuberculosis can spread when a person with the illness coughs, sneezes or sings. This can put tiny droplets with the germs into the air. Another person can then breathe in the droplets, and the germs enter the lungs. Tuberculosis spreads easily where people gather in crowds or where people live in crowded conditions. People with HIV/AIDS and other people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk of catching tuberculosis than people with typical immune systems. Drugs called antibiotics can treat tuberculosis. But some forms of the bacteria no longer respond well to treatments. When tuberculosis (TB) germs survive and multiply in the lungs, it is called a TB infection. A TB infection may be in one of three stages. Symptoms are different in each stage. Primary TB infection. The first stage is called the primary infection. Immune system cells find and capture the germs. The immune system may completely destroy the germs. But some captured germs may still survive and multiply. Most people don't have symptoms during a primary infection. Some people may get flu-like symptoms, such as: Latent TB infection. Primary infection is usually followed by the stage called latent TB infection. Immune system cells build a wall around lung tissue with TB germs. The germs can't do any more harm if the immune system keeps them under control. But the germs survive. There are no symptoms during latent TB infection. Active TB disease. Active TB disease happens when the immune system can't control an infection. Germs cause disease throughout the lungs or other parts of the body. Active TB disease may happen right after primary infection. But it usually happens after months or years of latent TB infection. Symptoms of active TB disease in the lungs usually begin gradually and worsen over a few weeks. They may include: Active TB disease outside the lungs. TB infection can spread from the lungs to other parts of the body. This is called extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms vary depending on what part of the body is infected. Common symptoms may include: Active TB disease in the voice box is outside the lungs, but it has symptoms more like disease in the lungs. Common sites of active TB disease outside the lungs include: Active TB disease in children. Symptoms of active TB disease in children vary. Typically, symptoms by age may include the following: The symptoms of tuberculosis are similar to symptoms of many different illnesses. See your health care provider if you have symptoms that don't improve with a few days of rest. Get emergency care if you have: Get immediate or urgent care if you: Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. People with active TB disease in the lungs or voice box can spread the disease. They release tiny droplets that carry the bacteria through the air. This can happen when they're speaking, singing, laughing, coughing or sneezing. A person can get an infection after inhaling the droplets. The disease is more likely to spread when people spend a lot of time together in an indoor space. So the disease spreads easily in places where people live or work together for long periods. Also, the disease spreads more easily in crowded gatherings. A person with a latent TB infection cannot pass the disease to other people. A person taking drugs to treat active TB disease usually can't pass the disease after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment. Some forms of the TB bacteria have become drug resistant. This means that drugs that once cured the disease no longer work. This happens, in part, because of naturally occurring genetic changes in bacteria. A random genetic change in a bacterium might give it some quality that makes it more likely to survive the attack of an antibiotic. If it does survive, then it can multiply. When antibiotic drugs aren't used correctly — or drugs fail to kill all the bacteria for another reason — the conditions are ideal for more-resistant versions of the bacteria to get established and multiply. If these bacteria are passed on to other people, a new drug-resistant strain can grow over time. Problems that can lead to such drug-resistant strains of bacteria include the following: Anyone can get tuberculosis, but certain factors increase the risk of getting an infection. Other factors increase the risk of an infection becoming active TB disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a TB test for people who have an increased risk of TB infection or active TB disease. Talk to your health care provider if you have one or more of the following risk factors. Certain living or working conditions make it easier for the disease to pass from one person to another. These conditions increase the risk of getting a TB infection: A weakened immune system increases the risk of a TB infection becoming active TB disease. Conditions or treatments that weaken the immune system include: The risk of a TB infection becoming active TB disease changes with age. If you test positive for latent TB infection, you may need to take drugs to prevent active TB disease. If you have active TB disease, you'll need to take steps to prevent other people from getting an infection. You will take drugs for four, six or nine months. Take all of the drugs as directed during the entire time. During the first 2 to 3 weeks, you will be able to pass TB bacteria to others. Protect others with these steps: In countries where tuberculosis is common, infants often are vaccinated with the bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. This protects infants and toddlers who are more likely to have active TB disease in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The vaccine may not protect against disease in the lungs, which is more likely in the United States. Dozens of new TB vaccines are in various stages of development and testing.

"Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that is also known as TB. It can be fatal if not treated. TB most often affects your lungs, but can also affect other organs like your brain. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that can cause infection in your lungs or other tissues. It commonly affects your lungs, but it can also affect other organs like your spine, brain or kidneys. The word “tuberculosis” comes from a Latin word for ""nodule"" or something that sticks out. Tuberculosis is also known as TB. Not everyone who becomes infected with TB gets sick, but if you do get sick you need to be treated. If you’re infected with the bacterium, but don’t have symptoms, you have inactive tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis infection (also called latent TB). It may seem like TB has gone away, but it’s dormant (sleeping) inside your body. If you’re infected, develop symptoms and are contagious, you have active tuberculosis or tuberculosis disease (TB disease). The three stages of TB are: Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy About 10 million people became ill with TB throughout the world, and about 1.5 million people died from the disease in 2020. TB was once the leading cause of death in the U.S. but the number of cases fell rapidly in the 1940s and 1950s after researchers found treatments. Statistics show that there were 7,860 tuberculosis cases reported in the U.S. in 2021. The national incidence rate is 2.4 cases per 100,000 people. In addition to active or inactive, you might hear about different kinds of TB, including the most common, pulmonary (lung) tuberculosis. But the bacterium can also affect other parts of your body besides the lungs, causing extrapulmonary tuberculosis (or TB outside of the lung). You might also hear about systemic miliary tuberculosis, which can spread throughout your body and cause: Advertisement TB is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The germs are spread through the air and usually infect the lungs, but can also infect other parts of the body. Although TB is infectious, it doesn’t spread easily. You usually have to spend a lot of time in contact with someone who is contagious in order to catch it. TB can be spread when a person with active TB disease releases germs into the air through coughing, sneezing, talking, singing or even laughing. Only people with active pulmonary infection are contagious. Most people who breathe in TB bacteria are able to fight the bacteria and stop it from growing. The bacterium becomes inactive in these individuals, causing a latent TB infection. As many as 13 million people in the U.S. have latent TB. Although the bacteria are inactive, they still remain alive in the body and can become active later. Some people can have a latent TB infection for a lifetime, without it ever becoming active and developing into TB disease. However, TB can become active if your immune system becomes weakened and cannot stop the bacteria from growing. This is when the latent TB infection becomes active TB. Many researchers are working on treatments to stop this from happening. Advertisement People with inactive TB do not exhibit symptoms. However, they may have a positive skin reaction test or blood test. Those with active TB can show any of the following symptoms: There are two kinds of screening tests for TB: the Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) and the blood test, called the interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). For the TST, a healthcare provider will inject a small amount of a substance called purified protein derivative (PPD) under the skin of your forearm. After two to three days, you must go back to the healthcare provider, who will look at the injection site. For the IGRA, a healthcare provider will draw blood and send the sample to the lab. Further tests to determine if an infection is active or if your lungs are infected include: You may want to get tested for TB if: Others who are at risk for TB include: The incidence rates for minority groups in the U.S. are higher than the incidence rates for whites. TB infection and disease is treated with these drugs: You must take all of the medication your provider prescribes, or not all of the bacteria will be killed. You will have to take these medications for as long as you're told — sometimes up to nine months. Some forms of TB have become resistant to medications. It’s very important and likely that your provider will use more than one drug to treat TB. It’s very important to finish your entire prescription. Some people have side effects from the drugs used to treat TB that may include: Talk to your provider about any side effects because some might mean that you're experiencing liver damage. It will probably take weeks before you start having more energy and fewer days with symptoms. However, it will take longer than that to complete your treatment. You’ll need to take your medications for at least six to nine months. Yes, TB is curable. You usually have to be in contact with someone with active TB for a long time before becoming infected. It helps to follow infection prevention guidelines like: In the hospital, the most important measures to stop the spread of TB are having proper ventilation and using the correct types of personal protective equipment. Some countries (but not the U.S.) use a TB vaccine called Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). The vaccine is mostly given to children in countries with high rates of TB to prevent meningitis and a serious form of TB called miliary tuberculosis. The vaccine may make skin tests for TB less accurate. If you have tuberculosis and you’re treated, your outlook is good if you’ve followed directions and taken your medications for as long as you should and in the way you were told. If you’ve been exposed to TB, you should talk to your healthcare provider right away. They can help you make a decision about getting tested. That decision is more important if you’ve developed any symptoms of illness that could mean you’re contagious. Remember, even though tuberculosis can be treated, it can also be fatal if it’s not treated. A note from Cleveland Clinic Tuberculosis is an infection that is spread through the air. Even though it can be treated, it’s still responsible for many deaths around the world. Make sure you contact your healthcare provider if you think you’ve been exposed or have symptoms of TB.

"
 Tuberculosis (TB), also known colloquially as the ""white death"", or historically as consumption,[7] is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria.[1] Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body.[1] Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis.[1] Around 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kill about half of those affected.[1] Typical symptoms of active TB are chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.[1] Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms.[8]
 Tuberculosis is spread from one person to the next through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze.[1][9] People with latent TB do not spread the disease.[1] Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke.[1] Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids.[10] Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.[10]
 Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine.[3][4][5] Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB.[4] Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time.[1] Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem, with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).[1]
 In 2018, one quarter of the world's population was thought to have a latent infection of TB.[6] New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year.[11] In 2022, an estimated 10.6 million people developed active TB, resulting in 1.3 million deaths, making it the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease after COVID-19.[12] As of 2018, most TB cases occurred in the regions of South-East Asia (44%), Africa (24%), and the Western Pacific (18%), with more than 50% of cases being diagnosed in seven countries: India (27%), China (9%), Indonesia (8%), the Philippines (6%), Pakistan (6%), Nigeria (4%), and Bangladesh (4%).[13] By 2021, the number of new cases each year was decreasing by around 2% annually.[12][1] About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive, while 5–10% of people in the United States test positive via the tuberculin test.[14] Tuberculosis has been present in humans since ancient times.[15]
 Tuberculosis has existed since antiquity.[15] The oldest unambiguously detected M. tuberculosis gives evidence of the disease in the remains of bison in Wyoming dated to around 17,000 years ago.[16] However, whether tuberculosis originated in bovines, then transferred to humans, or whether both bovine and human tuberculosis diverged from a common ancestor, remains unclear.[17] A comparison of the genes of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in humans to MTBC in animals suggests humans did not acquire MTBC from animals during animal domestication, as researchers previously believed. Both strains of the tuberculosis bacteria share a common ancestor, which could have infected humans even before the Neolithic Revolution.[18] Skeletal remains show some prehistoric humans (4000 BC) had TB, and researchers have found tubercular decay in the spines of Egyptian mummies dating from 3000 to 2400 BC.[19] Genetic studies suggest the presence of TB in the Americas from about AD 100.[20]
 Before the Industrial Revolution, folklore often associated tuberculosis with vampires. When one member of a family died from the disease, the other infected members would lose their health slowly. People believed this was caused by the original person with TB draining the life from the other family members.[21]
 Although Richard Morton established the pulmonary form associated with tubercles as a pathology in 1689,[22][23] due to the variety of its symptoms, TB was not identified as a single disease until the 1820s.  Benjamin Marten conjectured in 1720 that consumptions were caused by microbes which were spread by people living close to each other.[24] In 1819, René Laennec claimed that tubercles were the cause of pulmonary tuberculosis.[25] J. L. Schönlein first published the name ""tuberculosis"" (German:  Tuberkulose) in 1832.[26][27] Between 1838 and 1845, John Croghan, the owner of Mammoth Cave in Kentucky from 1839 onwards, brought a number of people with tuberculosis into the cave in the hope of curing the disease with the constant temperature and purity of the cave air; each died within a year.[28] Hermann Brehmer opened the first TB sanatorium in 1859 in Görbersdorf (now Sokołowsko) in Silesia.[29] In 1865, Jean Antoine Villemin demonstrated that tuberculosis could be transmitted, via inoculation, from humans to animals and among animals.[30] (Villemin's findings were confirmed in 1867 and 1868 by John Burdon-Sanderson.[31])
 Robert Koch identified and described the bacillus causing tuberculosis, M. tuberculosis, on 24 March 1882.[32][33] In 1905, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery.[34]
 In Europe, rates of tuberculosis began to rise in the early 1600s to a peak level in the 1800s, when it caused nearly 25% of all deaths.[35] In the 18th and 19th century, tuberculosis had become epidemic in Europe, showing a seasonal pattern.[36][37] Tuberculosis caused widespread public concern in the 19th and early 20th centuries as the disease became common among the urban poor. In 1815, one in four deaths in England was due to ""consumption"". By 1918, TB still caused one in six deaths in France.[citation needed] After TB was determined to be contagious, in the 1880s, it was put on a notifiable-disease list in Britain; campaigns started to stop people from spitting in public places, and the infected poor were ""encouraged"" to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons (the sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention).[29] What later became known as the Alexandra Hospital for Children with Hip Disease (tuberculous arthritis) was opened in London in 1867.[38] Whatever the benefits of the ""fresh air"" and labor in the sanatoria, even under the best conditions, 50% of those who entered died within five years (c. 1916).[29]
 Robert Koch did not believe the cattle and human tuberculosis diseases were similar, which delayed the recognition of infected milk as a source of infection. During the first half of the 1900s, the risk of transmission from this source was dramatically reduced after the application of the pasteurization process. Koch announced a glycerine extract of the tubercle bacilli as a ""remedy"" for tuberculosis in 1890, calling it ""tuberculin"". Although it was not effective, it was later successfully adapted as a screening test for the presence of pre-symptomatic tuberculosis.[39] World Tuberculosis Day is marked on 24 March each year, the anniversary of Koch's original scientific announcement. When the Medical Research Council formed in Britain in 1913, it initially focused on tuberculosis research.[40]
 Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin achieved the first genuine success in immunization against tuberculosis in 1906, using attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis. It was called bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG). The BCG vaccine was first used on humans in 1921 in France,[41] but achieved widespread acceptance in the US, Great Britain, and Germany only after World War II.[42]
 By the 1950s mortality in Europe had decreased about 90%.[43] Improvements in sanitation, vaccination, and other public-health measures began significantly reducing rates of tuberculosis even before the arrival of streptomycin and other antibiotics, although the disease remained a significant threat.[43] In 1946, the development of the antibiotic streptomycin made effective treatment and cure of TB a reality. Prior to the introduction of this medication, the only treatment was surgical intervention, including the ""pneumothorax technique"", which involved collapsing an infected lung to ""rest"" it and to allow tuberculous lesions to heal.[44]
 Because of the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections. It involves the removal of infected chest cavities (""bullae"") in the lungs to reduce the number of bacteria and to increase exposure of the remaining bacteria to antibiotics in the bloodstream.[45] Hopes of eliminating TB ended with the rise of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1993.[46]
 Tuberculosis may infect any part of the body, but most commonly occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis).[8] Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside of the lungs, although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.[8]
 General signs and symptoms include fever, chills, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue.[8] Significant nail clubbing may also occur.[48]
 If a tuberculosis infection does become active, it most commonly involves the lungs (in about 90% of cases).[15][49] Symptoms may include chest pain and a prolonged cough producing sputum. About 25% of people may not have any symptoms (i.e., they remain asymptomatic).[15] Occasionally, people may cough up blood in small amounts, and in very rare cases, the infection may erode into the pulmonary artery or a Rasmussen aneurysm, resulting in massive bleeding.[8][50] Tuberculosis may become a chronic illness and cause extensive scarring in the upper lobes of the lungs. The upper lung lobes are more frequently affected by tuberculosis than the lower ones.[8] The reason for this difference is not clear.[14] It may be due to either better air flow,[14] or poor lymph drainage within the upper lungs.[8]
 In 15–20% of active cases, the infection spreads outside the lungs, causing other kinds of TB.[51] These are collectively denoted as extrapulmonary tuberculosis.[52] Extrapulmonary TB occurs more commonly in people with a weakened immune system and young children. In those with HIV, this occurs in more than 50% of cases.[52] Notable extrapulmonary infection sites include the pleura (in tuberculous pleurisy), the central nervous system (in tuberculous meningitis), the lymphatic system (in scrofula of the neck), the genitourinary system (in urogenital tuberculosis), and the bones and joints (in Pott disease of the spine), among others. A potentially more serious, widespread form of TB is called ""disseminated tuberculosis""; it is also known as miliary tuberculosis.[8] Miliary TB currently makes up about 10% of extrapulmonary cases.[53]
 The main cause of TB is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), a small, aerobic, nonmotile bacillus.[8] The high lipid content of this pathogen accounts for many of its unique clinical characteristics.[54] It divides every 16 to 20 hours, which is an extremely slow rate compared with other bacteria, which usually divide in less than an hour.[55] Mycobacteria have an outer membrane lipid bilayer.[56] If a Gram stain is performed, MTB either stains very weakly ""Gram-positive"" or does not retain dye as a result of the high lipid and mycolic acid content of its cell wall.[57] MTB can withstand weak disinfectants and survive in a dry state for weeks. In nature, the bacterium can grow only within the cells of a host organism, but M. tuberculosis can be cultured in the laboratory.[58]
 Using histological stains on expectorated samples from phlegm (also called sputum), scientists can identify MTB under a microscope. Since MTB retains certain stains even after being treated with acidic solution, it is classified as an acid-fast bacillus.[14][57] The most common acid-fast staining techniques are the Ziehl–Neelsen stain[59] and the Kinyoun stain, which dye acid-fast bacilli a bright red that stands out against a blue background.[60] Auramine-rhodamine staining[61] and fluorescence microscopy[62] are also used.
 The M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) includes four other TB-causing mycobacteria: M. bovis, M. africanum, M. canettii, and M. microti.[63] M. africanum is not widespread, but it is a significant cause of tuberculosis in parts of Africa.[64][65] M. bovis was once a common cause of tuberculosis, but the introduction of pasteurized milk has almost eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries.[14][66] M. canettii is rare and seems to be limited to the Horn of Africa, although a few cases have been seen in African emigrants.[67][68] M. microti is also rare and is seen almost only in immunodeficient people, although its prevalence may be significantly underestimated.[69]
 
Other known pathogenic mycobacteria include M. leprae, M. avium, and M. kansasii. The latter two species are classified as ""nontuberculous mycobacteria"" (NTM) or atypical mycobacteria. NTM cause neither TB nor leprosy, but they do cause lung diseases that resemble TB.[70] When people with active pulmonary TB cough, sneeze, speak, sing, or spit, they expel infectious aerosol droplets 0.5 to 5.0 μm in diameter. A single sneeze can release up to 40,000 droplets.[71] Each one of these droplets may transmit the disease, since the infectious dose of tuberculosis is very small (the inhalation of fewer than 10 bacteria may cause an infection).[72]
 People with prolonged, frequent, or close contact with people with TB are at particularly high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate.[73] A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year.[74] Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious.[14] The probability of transmission from one person to another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others.[75] The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active (""overt"") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others.[73] If someone does become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.[76]
 A number of factors make individuals more susceptible to TB infection and/or disease.[77]
 The most important risk factor globally for developing active TB is concurrent HIV infection; 13% of those with TB are also infected with HIV.[78] This is a particular problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV infection rates are high.[79][80] Of those without HIV infection who are infected with tuberculosis, about 5–10% develop active disease during their lifetimes;[48] in contrast, 30% of those co-infected with HIV develop the active disease.[48]
 Use of certain medications, such as corticosteroids and infliximab (an anti-αTNF monoclonal antibody), is another important risk factor, especially in the developed world.[15]
 Other risk factors include: alcoholism,[15] diabetes mellitus (3-fold increased risk),[81] silicosis (30-fold increased risk),[82] tobacco smoking (2-fold increased risk),[83] indoor air pollution, malnutrition, young age,[77] recently acquired TB infection, recreational drug use, severe kidney disease, low body weight, organ transplant, head and neck cancer,[84] and genetic susceptibility[85] (the overall importance of genetic risk factors remains undefined[15]).
 Tobacco smoking increases the risk of infections (in addition to increasing the risk of active disease and death). Additional factors increasing infection susceptibility include young age.[77]
 About 90% of those infected with M. tuberculosis have asymptomatic, latent TB infections (sometimes called LTBI),[87] with only a 10% lifetime chance that the latent infection will progress to overt, active tuberculous disease.[88] In those with HIV, the risk of developing active TB increases to nearly 10% a year.[88] If effective treatment is not given, the death rate for active TB cases is up to 66%.[74]
 TB infection begins when the mycobacteria reach the alveolar air sacs of the lungs, where they invade and replicate within endosomes of alveolar macrophages.[14][89][90] Macrophages identify the bacterium as foreign and attempt to eliminate it by phagocytosis. During this process, the bacterium is enveloped by the macrophage and stored temporarily in a membrane-bound vesicle called a phagosome. The phagosome then combines with a lysosome to create a phagolysosome. In the phagolysosome, the cell attempts to use reactive oxygen species and acid to kill the bacterium.  However, M. tuberculosis has a thick, waxy mycolic acid capsule that protects it from these toxic substances. M. tuberculosis is able to reproduce inside the macrophage and will eventually kill the immune cell.
 The primary site of infection in the lungs, known as the Ghon focus, is generally located in either the upper part of the lower lobe, or the lower part of the upper lobe.[14] Tuberculosis of the lungs may also occur via infection from the blood stream. This is known as a Simon focus and is typically found in the top of the lung.[91] This hematogenous transmission can also spread infection to more distant sites, such as peripheral lymph nodes, the kidneys, the brain, and the bones.[14][92] All parts of the body can be affected by the disease, though for unknown reasons it rarely affects the heart, skeletal muscles, pancreas, or thyroid.[93]
 Tuberculosis is classified as one of the granulomatous inflammatory diseases. Macrophages, epithelioid cells, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and fibroblasts  aggregate to form granulomas, with lymphocytes surrounding the infected macrophages. When other macrophages attack the infected macrophage, they fuse together to form a giant multinucleated cell in the alveolar lumen. The granuloma may prevent dissemination of the mycobacteria and provide a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system.[94] However, more recent evidence suggests that the bacteria use the granulomas to avoid destruction by the host's immune system.  Macrophages and dendritic cells in the granulomas are unable to present antigen to lymphocytes; thus the immune response is suppressed.[95] Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant, resulting in latent infection. Another feature of the granulomas is the development of abnormal cell death (necrosis) in the center of tubercles.  To the naked eye, this has the texture of soft, white cheese and is termed caseous necrosis.[94]
 If TB bacteria gain entry to the blood stream from an area of damaged tissue, they can spread throughout the body and set up many foci of infection, all appearing as tiny, white tubercles in the tissues.[96] This severe form of TB disease, most common in young children and those with HIV, is called miliary tuberculosis.[97] People with this disseminated TB have a high fatality rate even with treatment (about 30%).[53][98]
 In many people, the infection waxes and wanes. Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis.[94] Affected tissue is replaced by scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material. During active disease, some of these cavities are joined to the air passages (bronchi) and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria and thus can spread the infection. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue.[94]
 Diagnosing active tuberculosis based only on signs and symptoms is difficult,[99] as is diagnosing the disease in those who have a weakened immune system.[100] A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.[100] A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation.[100] Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in most of the developing world.[101][102] IGRA have similar limitations in those with HIV.[102][103]
 A definitive diagnosis of TB is made by identifying M. tuberculosis in a clinical sample (e.g., sputum, pus, or a tissue biopsy). However, the difficult culture process for this slow-growing organism can take two to six weeks for blood or sputum culture.[104] Thus, treatment is often begun before cultures are confirmed.[105]
 Nucleic acid amplification tests and adenosine deaminase testing may allow rapid diagnosis of TB.[99] Blood tests to detect antibodies are not specific or sensitive, so they are not recommended.[106]
 The Mantoux tuberculin skin test is often used to screen people at high risk for TB.[100] Those who have been previously immunized with the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine may have a false-positive test result.[107] The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis.[14] Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test.[105] These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results.[108] However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii.[109] IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.[110]
 The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended screening people who are at high risk for latent tuberculosis with either tuberculin skin tests or interferon-gamma release assays.[111] While some have recommend testing health care workers, evidence of benefit for this is poor as of 2019[update].[112] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stopped recommending yearly testing of health care workers without known exposure in 2019.[113]
 Tuberculosis prevention and control efforts rely primarily on the vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases.[15] The World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers.[15] Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.[114]
 The only available vaccine as of 2021[update] is bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG).[115][116] In children it decreases the risk of getting the infection by 20% and the risk of infection turning into active disease by nearly 60%.[117]
 It is the most widely used vaccine worldwide, with more than 90% of all children being vaccinated.[15] The immunity it induces decreases after about ten years.[15] As tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada, Western Europe, and the United States, BCG is administered to only those people at high risk.[118][119][120] Part of the reasoning against the use of the vaccine is that it makes the tuberculin skin test falsely positive, reducing the test's usefulness as a screening tool.[120] Several vaccines are being developed.[15]
 Intradermal MVA85A vaccine in addition to BCG injection is not effective in preventing tuberculosis.[121]
 Public health campaigns which have focused on overcrowding, public spitting and regular sanitation (including hand washing) during the 1800s helped to either interrupt or slow spread which when combined with contact tracing, isolation and treatment helped to dramatically curb the transmission of both tuberculosis and other airborne diseases which led to the elimination of tuberculosis as a major public health issue in most developed economies.[122][123] Other risk factors which worsened TB spread such as malnutrition were also ameliorated, but since the emergence of HIV a new population of immunocompromised individuals was available for TB to infect.
 During the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the US, up to 35% of those affected by TB were also infected by HIV.[124] Handling of TB-infected patients in US hospitals was known to create airborne TB that could infect others, especially in unventilated spaces.[125]
 Multiple US agencies rolled out new public health rules as a result of the TB spread: the CDC brought in new guidelines mandating HEPA filters and HEPA respirators,[126] NIOSH pushed through new 42 CFR 84 respirator regulations in 1995 (like the N95),[127] and OSHA created a proposed rule for TB in 1997, a result of pressure from groups like the Labor Coalition to Fight TB in the Workplace.[128][129]
 However, in 2003, OSHA dropped their proposed TB rules, citing a decline of TB in the US, and public disapproval.[130]
 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared TB a ""global health emergency"" in 1993,[15] and in 2006, the Stop TB Partnership developed a Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis that aimed to save 14 million lives between its launch and 2015.[131] A number of targets they set were not achieved by 2015, mostly due to the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis and the emergence of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis.[15] A tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is used primarily in public health programs.[132] In 2015, it launched the End TB Strategy to reduce deaths by 95% and incidence by 90% before 2035. The goal of tuberculosis elimination is being hampered by the lack of rapid testing, short and effective treatment courses, and completely effective vaccines.[133]
 The benefits and risks of giving anti-tubercular drugs to those exposed to MDR-TB is unclear.[134] Making HAART therapy available to HIV-positive individuals significantly reduces the risk of progression to an active TB infection by up to 90% and can mitigate the spread through this population.[135]
 Treatment of TB uses antibiotics to kill the bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective.[136]
 Active TB is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance.[15] The routine use of rifabutin instead of rifampicin in HIV-positive people with tuberculosis is of unclear benefit as of 2007[update].[137]
 Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) at a dose of 100 mg per day has been shown to improve clinical signs and symptoms, reduce cavitary lesions, lower inflammatory markers, and increase the rate of sputum-negative conversion in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.[138]
 Latent TB is treated with either isoniazid or rifampin alone, or a combination of isoniazid with either rifampicin or rifapentine.[139][140][141]
 The treatment takes three to nine months depending on the medications used.[75][139][142][141] People with latent infections are treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life.[143]
 Education or counselling may improve the latent tuberculosis treatment completion rates.[144]
 The recommended treatment of new-onset pulmonary tuberculosis, as of 2010[update], is six months of a combination of antibiotics containing rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first two months, and only rifampicin and isoniazid for the last four months.[15] Where resistance to isoniazid is high, ethambutol may be added for the last four months as an alternative.[15] Treatment with anti-TB drugs for at least 6 months results in higher success rates when compared with treatment less than 6 months, even though the difference is small. Shorter treatment regimen may be recommended for those with compliance issues.[145] There is also no evidence to support shorter anti-tuberculosis treatment regimens when compared to a 6-month treatment regimen.[146] However, results presented in 2020 from an international, randomized, controlled clinical trial indicate that a four-month daily treatment regimen containing high-dose, or ""optimized"", rifapentine with moxifloxacin (2PHZM/2PHM) is as safe and effective as the existing standard six-month daily regimen at curing drug-susceptible tuberculosis (TB) disease.[147]
 If tuberculosis recurs, testing to determine which antibiotics it is sensitive to is important before determining treatment.[15] If multiple drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is detected, treatment with at least four effective antibiotics for 18 to 24 months is recommended.[15]
 Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics.[148] The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality.[149] There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine.[149] Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker.[149] Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.[150] There is also not enough evidence to support intermittent rifampicin-containing therapy given two to three times a week has equal effectiveness as daily dose regimen on improving cure rates and reducing relapsing rates.[151] There is also not enough evidence on effectiveness of giving intermittent twice or thrice weekly short course regimen compared to daily dosing regimen in treating children with tuberculosis.[152]
 Primary resistance occurs when a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication.[153] Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs.[154] Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs.[155] It was first observed in 2003 in Italy,[156] but not widely reported until 2012,[155][157] and has also been found in Iran and India.[158] There is some efficacy for linezolid to treat those with XDR-TB but side effects and discontinuation of medications were common.[159][160] Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.[161]
 XDR-TB is a term sometimes used to define extensively resistant TB, and constitutes one in ten cases of MDR-TB. Cases of XDR TB have been identified in more than 90% of countries.[158]
 For those with known rifampicin or MDR-TB, molecular tests such as the Genotype MTBDRsl Assay (performed on culture isolates or smear positive specimens) may be useful to detect second-line anti-tubercular drug resistance.[162][163]
 Progression from TB infection to overt TB disease occurs when the bacilli overcome the immune system defenses and begin to multiply. In primary TB disease (some 1–5% of cases), this occurs soon after the initial infection.[14] However, in the majority of cases, a latent infection occurs with no obvious symptoms.[14] These dormant bacilli produce active tuberculosis in 5–10% of these latent cases, often many years after infection.[48]
 The risk of reactivation increases with immunosuppression, such as that caused by infection with HIV. In people coinfected with M. tuberculosis and HIV, the risk of reactivation increases to 10% per year.[14] Studies using DNA fingerprinting of M. tuberculosis strains have shown reinfection contributes more substantially to recurrent TB than previously thought,[165] with estimates that it might account for more than 50% of reactivated cases in areas where TB is common.[166] The chance of death from a case of tuberculosis is about 4% as of 2008[update], down from 8% in 1995.[15]
 In people with smear-positive pulmonary TB (without HIV co-infection), after 5 years without treatment, 50-60% die while 20-25% achieve spontaneous resolution (cure). TB is almost always fatal in those with untreated HIV co-infection and death rates are increased even with antiretroviral treatment of HIV.[167]
 Roughly one-quarter of the world's population has been infected with M. tuberculosis,[6] with new infections occurring in about 1% of the population each year.[11] However, most infections with M. tuberculosis do not cause disease,[168] and 90–95% of infections remain asymptomatic.[87] In 2012, an estimated 8.6 million chronic cases were active.[169] In 2010, 8.8 million new cases of tuberculosis were diagnosed, and 1.20–1.45 million deaths occurred (most of these occurring in developing countries).[78][170] Of these, about 0.35 million occur in those also infected with HIV.[171] In 2018, tuberculosis was the leading cause of death worldwide from a single infectious agent.[172] The total number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2005, while new cases have decreased since 2002.[78]
 Tuberculosis[clarification needed] incidence is seasonal, with peaks occurring every spring and summer.[173][174][175][176] The reasons for this are unclear, but may be related to vitamin D deficiency during the winter.[176][177] There are also studies linking tuberculosis to different weather conditions like low temperature, low humidity and low rainfall. It has been suggested that tuberculosis incidence rates may be connected to climate change.[178]
 Tuberculosis is closely linked to both overcrowding and malnutrition, making it one of the principal diseases of poverty.[15] Those at high risk thus include: people who inject illicit drugs, inhabitants and employees of locales where vulnerable people gather (e.g., prisons and homeless shelters), medically underprivileged and resource-poor communities, high-risk ethnic minorities, children in close contact with high-risk category patients, and health-care providers serving these patients.[179]
 The rate of tuberculosis varies with age. In Africa, it primarily affects adolescents and young adults.[180] However, in countries where incidence rates have declined dramatically (such as the United States), tuberculosis is mainly a disease of the elderly and immunocompromised (risk factors are listed above).[14][181] Worldwide, 22 ""high-burden"" states or countries together experience 80% of cases as well as 83% of deaths.[158]
 In Canada and Australia, tuberculosis is many times more common among the Indigenous peoples, especially in remote areas.[182][183] Factors contributing to this include higher prevalence of predisposing health conditions and behaviours, and overcrowding and poverty. In some Canadian Indigenous groups, genetic susceptibility may play a role.[77]
 Socioeconomic status (SES) strongly affects TB risk. People of low SES are both more likely to contract TB and to be more severely affected by the disease. Those with low SES are more likely to be affected by risk factors for developing TB (e.g., malnutrition, indoor air pollution, HIV co-infection, etc.), and are additionally more likely to be exposed to crowded and poorly ventilated spaces. Inadequate healthcare also means that people with active disease who facilitate spread are not diagnosed and treated promptly; sick people thus remain in the infectious state and (continue to) spread the infection.[77]
 The distribution of tuberculosis is not uniform across the globe; about 80% of the population in many African, Caribbean, South Asian, and eastern European countries test positive in tuberculin tests, while only 5–10% of the U.S. population test positive.[14] Hopes of totally controlling the disease have been dramatically dampened because of many factors, including the difficulty of developing an effective vaccine, the expensive and time-consuming diagnostic process, the necessity of many months of treatment, the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis, and the emergence of drug-resistant cases in the 1980s.[15]
 In developed countries, tuberculosis is less common and is found mainly in urban areas. In Europe, deaths from TB fell from 500 out of 100,000 in 1850 to 50 out of 100,000 by 1950. Improvements in public health were reducing tuberculosis even before the arrival of antibiotics, although the disease remained a significant threat to public health, such that when the Medical Research Council was formed in Britain in 1913 its initial focus was tuberculosis research.[184]
 In 2010, rates per 100,000 people in different areas of the world were: globally 178, Africa 332, the Americas 36, Eastern Mediterranean 173, Europe 63, Southeast Asia 278, and Western Pacific 139.[171]
 Russia has achieved particularly dramatic progress with a decline in its TB mortality rate—from 61.9 per 100,000 in 1965 to 2.7 per 100,000 in 1993;[185][186] however, mortality rate increased to 24 per 100,000 in 2005 and then recoiled to 11 per 100,000 by 2015.[187]
 China has achieved particularly dramatic progress, with about an 80% reduction in its TB mortality rate between 1990 and 2010.[171] The number of new cases has declined by 17% between 2004 and 2014.[158]
 In 2007, the country with the highest estimated incidence rate of TB was Eswatini, with 1,200 cases per 100,000 people. In 2017, the country with the highest estimated incidence rate as a % of the population was Lesotho, with 665 cases per 100,000 people.[188]
 In South Africa, 54,200 people died in 2022 from TB. The incidence rate was 468 per 100,000 people; in 2015, this was 988 per 100,000. The total incidence was 280,000 in 2022; in 2015, this was 552,000.[189]
 As of 2017, India had the largest total incidence, with an estimated 2,740,000 cases.[188] According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2000–2015, India's estimated mortality rate dropped from 55 to 36 per 100,000 population per year with estimated 480 thousand people died of TB in 2015.[190][191] In India a major proportion of tuberculosis patients are being treated by private partners and private hospitals. Evidence indicates that the tuberculosis national survey does not represent the number of cases that are diagnosed and recorded by private clinics and hospitals in India.[192]
 In the United States, Native Americans have a fivefold greater mortality from TB,[193] and racial and ethnic minorities accounted for 84% of all reported TB cases.[194] The overall tuberculosis case rate in the United States was 3 per 100,000 persons in 2017.[188]
 In 2024, Long Beach, California authorized a public health emergency in response to a local outbreak of TB.[195]
 In Canada, tuberculosis was endemic in some rural areas as of 1998.[196]
 In 2017, in the United Kingdom, the national average was 9 per 100,000 and the highest incidence rates in Western Europe were 20 per 100,000 in Portugal.
 Tuberculosis has been known by many names from the technical to the familiar.[199] Phthisis (φθίσις) is the Greek word for consumption, an old term for pulmonary tuberculosis;[7] around 460 BCE, Hippocrates described phthisis as a disease of dry seasons.[200] The abbreviation TB is short for tubercle bacillus. Consumption was the most common nineteenth century English word for the disease, and was also in use well into the twentieth century. The Latin root con meaning 'completely' is linked to sumere meaning 'to take up from under'.[201] In The Life and Death of Mr Badman by John Bunyan, the author calls consumption ""the captain of all these men of death.""[202] ""Great white plague"" has also been used.[199]
 Tuberculosis was for centuries associated with poetic and artistic qualities among those infected, and was also known as ""the romantic disease"".[199][203] Major artistic figures such as the poets John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Edgar Allan Poe, the composer Frédéric Chopin,[204] the playwright Anton Chekhov, the novelists Franz Kafka, Katherine Mansfield,[205] Charlotte Brontë, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Thomas Mann, W. Somerset Maugham,[206] George Orwell,[207] and Robert Louis Stevenson, and the artists Alice Neel,[208] Jean-Antoine Watteau, Elizabeth Siddal, Marie Bashkirtseff, Edvard Munch, Aubrey Beardsley and Amedeo Modigliani either had the disease or were surrounded by people who did. A widespread belief was that tuberculosis assisted artistic talent. Physical mechanisms proposed for this effect included the slight fever and toxaemia that it caused, allegedly helping them to see life more clearly and to act decisively.[209][210][211]
 Tuberculosis formed an often-reused theme in literature, as in Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, set in a sanatorium;[212] in music, as in Van Morrison's song ""T.B. Sheets"";[213] in opera, as in Puccini's La bohème and Verdi's La Traviata;[211] in art, as in Munch's painting of his ill sister;[214] and in film, such as the 1945 The Bells of St. Mary's starring Ingrid Bergman as a nun with tuberculosis.[215]
 In 2014, the WHO adopted the ""End TB"" strategy which aims to reduce TB incidence by 80% and TB deaths by 90% by 2030.[216] The strategy contains a milestone to reduce TB incidence by 20% and TB deaths by 35% by 2020.[217] However, by 2020 only a 9% reduction in incidence per population was achieved globally, with the European region achieving 19% and the African region achieving 16% reductions.[217] Similarly, the number of deaths only fell by 14%, missing the 2020 milestone of a 35% reduction, with some regions making better progress (31% reduction in Europe and 19% in Africa).[217] Correspondingly, also treatment, prevention and funding milestones were missed in 2020, for example only 6.3 million people were started on TB prevention short of the target of 30 million.[217]
 The World Health Organization (WHO), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the U.S. government are subsidizing a fast-acting diagnostic tuberculosis test for use in low- and middle-income countries as of 2012.[218][219][220] In addition to being fast-acting, the test can determine if there is resistance to the antibiotic rifampicin which may indicate multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and is accurate in those who are also infected with HIV.[218][221] Many resource-poor places as of 2011[update] have access to only sputum microscopy.[222]
 India had the highest total number of TB cases worldwide in 2010, in part due to poor disease management within the private and public health care sector.[223] Programs such as the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program are working to reduce TB levels among people receiving public health care.[224][225]
 A 2014 EIU-healthcare report finds there is a need to address apathy and urges for increased funding. The report cites among others Lucica Ditui ""[TB] is like an orphan. It has been neglected even in countries with a high burden and often forgotten by donors and those investing in health interventions.""[158]
 Slow progress has led to frustration, expressed by the executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria – Mark Dybul: ""we have the tools to end TB as a pandemic and public health threat on the planet, but we are not doing it.""[158] Several international organizations are pushing for more transparency in treatment, and more countries are implementing mandatory reporting of cases to the government as of 2014, although adherence is often variable. Commercial treatment providers may at times overprescribe second-line drugs as well as supplementary treatment, promoting demands for further regulations.[158] The government of Brazil provides universal TB care, which reduces this problem.[158] Conversely, falling rates of TB infection may not relate to the number of programs directed at reducing infection rates but may be tied to an increased level of education, income, and health of the population.[158] Costs of the disease, as calculated by the World Bank in 2009 may exceed US$150 billion per year in ""high burden"" countries.[158] Lack of progress eradicating the disease may also be due to lack of patient follow-up – as among the 250 million rural migrants in China.[158]
 There is insufficient data to show that active contact tracing helps to improve case detection rates for tuberculosis.[226] Interventions such as house-to-house visits, educational leaflets, mass media strategies, educational sessions may increase tuberculosis detection rates in short-term.[227] There is no study that compares new methods of contact tracing such as social network analysis with existing contact tracing methods.[228]
 Slow progress in preventing the disease may in part be due to stigma associated with TB.[158] Stigma may be due to the fear of transmission from affected individuals. This stigma may additionally arise due to links between TB and poverty, and in Africa, AIDS.[158] Such stigmatization may be both real and perceived; for example, in Ghana, individuals with TB are banned from attending public gatherings.[229]
 Stigma towards TB may result in delays in seeking treatment,[158] lower treatment compliance, and family members keeping cause of death secret[229] – allowing the disease to spread further.[158] In contrast, in Russia stigma was associated with increased treatment compliance.[229] TB stigma also affects socially marginalized individuals to a greater degree and varies between regions.[229]
 One way to decrease stigma may be through the promotion of ""TB clubs"", where those infected may share experiences and offer support, or through counseling.[229] Some studies have shown TB education programs to be effective in decreasing stigma, and may thus be effective in increasing treatment adherence.[229] Despite this, studies on the relationship between reduced stigma and mortality are lacking as of 2010[update], and similar efforts to decrease stigma surrounding AIDS have been minimally effective.[229] Some have claimed the stigma to be worse than the disease, and healthcare providers may unintentionally reinforce stigma, as those with TB are often perceived as difficult or otherwise undesirable.[158] A greater understanding of the social and cultural dimensions of tuberculosis may also help with stigma reduction.[230]
 The BCG vaccine has limitations, and research to develop new TB vaccines is ongoing.[231] A number of potential candidates are currently in phase I and II clinical trials.[231][232] Two main approaches are used to attempt to improve the efficacy of available vaccines. One approach involves adding a subunit vaccine to BCG, while the other strategy is attempting to create new and better live vaccines.[231] MVA85A, an example of a subunit vaccine, is in trials in South Africa as of 2006, is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus.[233] Vaccines are hoped to play a significant role in treatment of both latent and active disease.[234]
 To encourage further discovery, researchers and policymakers are promoting new economic models of vaccine development as of 2006, including prizes, tax incentives, and advance market commitments.[235][236] A number of groups, including the Stop TB Partnership,[237] the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, and the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation, are involved with research.[238] Among these, the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation received a gift of more than $280 million (US) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop and license an improved vaccine against tuberculosis for use in high burden countries.[239][240]
 In 2012 a new medication regimen was approved in the US for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, using bedaquiline as well as existing drugs. There were initial concerns about the safety of this drug,[241][242][243][244][245] but later research on larger groups found that this regimen improved health outcomes.[246] By 2017 the drug was used in at least 89 countries.[247] Another new drug is delamanid, which was first approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2013 to be used in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients,[248] and by 2017 was used in at least 54 countries.[249]
 Steroids add-on therapy has not shown any benefits for active pulmonary tuberculosis infection.[250]
 Mycobacteria infect many different animals, including birds,[251] fish, rodents,[252] and reptiles.[253] The subspecies Mycobacterium tuberculosis, though, is rarely present in wild animals.[254] An effort to eradicate bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis from the cattle and deer herds of New Zealand has been relatively successful.[255] Efforts in Great Britain have been less successful.[256][257]
 As of 2015[update], tuberculosis appears to be widespread among captive elephants in the US. It is believed that the animals originally acquired the disease from humans, a process called reverse zoonosis. Because the disease can spread through the air to infect both humans and other animals, it is a public health concern affecting circuses and zoos.[258][259]

 Type 2 diabetes (T2D), formerly known as adult-onset diabetes, is a form of diabetes mellitus that is characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and relative lack of insulin.[6] Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue and unexplained weight loss.[3] Symptoms may also include increased hunger,  having a sensation of pins and needles, and sores (wounds) that do not heal.[3] Often symptoms come on slowly.[6] Long-term complications from high blood sugar include heart disease, stroke, diabetic retinopathy which can result in blindness, kidney failure, and poor blood flow in the limbs which may lead to amputations.[1] The sudden onset of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state may occur; however, ketoacidosis is uncommon.[4][5]
 Type 2 diabetes primarily occurs as a result of obesity and lack of exercise.[1] Some people are genetically more at risk than others.[6]
 Type 2 diabetes makes up about 90% of cases of diabetes, with the other 10% due primarily to type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes.[1] In type 1 diabetes there is a lower total level of insulin to control blood glucose, due to an autoimmune induced loss of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.[12][13] Diagnosis of diabetes is by blood tests such as fasting plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance test, or glycated hemoglobin (A1C).[3]
 Type 2 diabetes is largely preventable by staying at a normal weight, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet (high in fruits and vegetables and low in sugar and saturated fats).[1] Treatment involves exercise and dietary changes.[1] If blood sugar levels are not adequately lowered, the medication metformin is typically recommended.[7][14] Many people may eventually also require insulin injections.[9] In those on insulin, routinely checking blood sugar levels (such as through a continuous glucose monitor) is advised; however, this may not be needed in those who are not on insulin therapy.[15] Bariatric surgery often improves diabetes in those who are obese.[8][16]
 Rates of type 2 diabetes have increased markedly since 1960 in parallel with obesity.[17] As of 2015 there were approximately 392 million people diagnosed with the disease compared to around 30 million in 1985.[11][18] Typically it begins in middle or older age,[6] although rates of type 2 diabetes are increasing in young people.[19][20] Type 2 diabetes is associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy.[10] Diabetes was one of the first diseases ever described, dating back to an Egyptian manuscript from c. 1500 BCE.[21] The importance of insulin in the disease was determined in the 1920s.[22]
 The classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination (polyuria), increased thirst (polydipsia), increased hunger (polyphagia), and weight loss.[23] Other symptoms that are commonly present at diagnosis include a history of blurred vision, itchiness, peripheral neuropathy, recurrent vaginal infections, and fatigue.[13] Other symptoms may include loss of taste.[24]  Many people, however, have no symptoms during the first few years and are diagnosed on routine testing.[13] A small number of people with type 2 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and low blood pressure).[13]
 Type 2 diabetes is typically a chronic disease associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy.[10][25] This is partly due to a number of complications with which it is associated, including: two to four times the risk of cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease and stroke; a 20-fold increase in lower limb amputations, and increased rates of hospitalizations.[10] In the developed world, and increasingly elsewhere, type 2 diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic blindness and kidney failure.[26] It has also been associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia through disease processes such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.[27] Other complications include hyperpigmentation of skin (acanthosis nigricans), sexual dysfunction, diabetic ketoacidosis, and frequent infections.[23][28][29] There is also an association between type 2 diabetes and mild hearing loss.[30]
 The development of type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors.[26][31] While some of these factors are under personal control, such as diet and obesity, other factors are not, such as increasing age, female sex, and genetics.[10] Generous consumption of alcohol is also a risk factor.[32] Obesity is more common in women than men in many parts of Africa.[33] The nutritional status of a mother during fetal development may also play a role, with one proposed mechanism being that of DNA methylation.[34] The intestinal bacteria Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus have been connected with type 2 diabetes.[35]
 Lifestyle factors are important to the development of type 2 diabetes, including obesity and being overweight (defined by a body mass index of greater than 25), lack of physical activity, poor diet, psychological stress, and urbanization.[10][36] Excess body fat is associated with 30% of cases in those of Chinese and Japanese descent, 60–80% of cases in those of European and African descent, and 100% of cases in Pima Indians and Pacific Islanders.[13] Among those who are not obese, a high waist–hip ratio is often present.[13] Smoking appears to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.[37]  A lack of sleep has also been linked to type 2 diabetes.[38] Laboratory studies have linked short-term sleep deprivations to changes in glucose metabolism, nervous system activity, or hormonal factors that may lead to diabetes.[38]
 Dietary factors also influence the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks in excess is associated with an increased risk.[39][40] The type of fats in the diet are important, with saturated fats and trans fatty acids increasing the risk, and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat decreasing the risk.[31] Eating a lot of white rice appears to play a role in increasing risk.[41] A lack of exercise is believed to cause 7% of cases.[42] Persistent organic pollutants may also play a role.[43]
 Most cases of diabetes involve many genes, with each being a small contributor to an increased probability of becoming a type 2 diabetic.[10] The proportion of diabetes that is inherited is estimated at 72%.[44] More than 36 genes and 80 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) had been found that contribute to the risk of type 2 diabetes.[45][46] All of these genes together still only account for 10% of the total heritable component of the disease.[45] The TCF7L2 allele, for example, increases the risk of developing diabetes by 1.5 times and is the greatest risk of the common genetic variants.[13] Most of the genes linked to diabetes are involved in pancreatic beta cell functions.[13]
 There are a number of rare cases of diabetes that arise due to an abnormality in a single gene (known as monogenic forms of diabetes or ""other specific types of diabetes"").[10][13] These include maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), Donohue syndrome, and Rabson–Mendenhall syndrome, among others.[10] Maturity onset diabetes of the young constitute 1–5% of all cases of diabetes in young people.[47]
 Epigenetic regulation occurs at multiple levels including (1) direct methylation of cytosine and adenine residues in DNA, (2) covalent modification of histone proteins in chromatin, and (3) action of non coding microRNAs (for other examples, see Wikipedia article ""Epigenetics"").  On November 17–19, 2017, the American Diabetes Association held a research symposium entitled ""Epigenetics and Epigenomics: Implications for Diabetes and Obesity.""  As a result of this symposium, an overview of the state of the field was presented in which it was noted that over 1,000 research articles have been published that address the intersection of diabetes and epigenetics or epigenomics.[48]  The current state of knowledge in this field is addressed the Wikipedia article ""Epigenetics of diabetes Type 2.""
 There are a number of medications and other health problems that can predispose to diabetes.[49] Some of the medications include: glucocorticoids, thiazides, beta blockers, atypical antipsychotics,[50] and statins.[51] Those who have previously had gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.[23] Other health problems that are associated include: acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, and certain cancers such as glucagonomas.[49] Individuals with cancer may be at a higher risk of mortality if they also have diabetes.[52] Testosterone deficiency is also associated with type 2 diabetes.[53][54] Eating disorders may also interact with type 2 diabetes, with bulimia nervosa increasing the risk and anorexia nervosa decreasing it.[55]
 Type 2 diabetes is due to insufficient insulin production from beta cells in the setting of insulin resistance.[13] Insulin resistance, which is the inability of cells to respond adequately to normal levels of insulin, occurs primarily within the muscles, liver, and fat tissue.[59] In the liver, insulin normally suppresses glucose release. However, in the setting of insulin resistance, the liver inappropriately releases glucose into the blood.[10] The proportion of insulin resistance versus beta cell dysfunction differs among individuals, with some having primarily insulin resistance and only a minor defect in insulin secretion and others with slight insulin resistance and primarily a lack of insulin secretion.[13]
 Other potentially important mechanisms associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance include: increased breakdown of lipids within fat cells, resistance to and lack of incretin, high glucagon levels in the blood, increased retention of salt and water by the kidneys, and inappropriate regulation of metabolism by the central nervous system.[10] However, not all people with insulin resistance develop diabetes since an impairment of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is also required.[13]
 In the early stages of insulin resistance, the mass of beta cells expands, increasing the output of insulin to compensate for the insulin insensitivity, so that the disposition index remains constant.[60] But when type 2 diabetes has become manifest, a type 2 diabetic will have lost about half of their beta cells.[60]
Fatty acids in the beta cells activate FOXO1, resulting in apoptosis of the beta cells.[60] The disposition index drops and diabetes becomes manifest.
 The causes of the aging-related insulin resistance seen in obesity and in type 2 diabetes are uncertain. Effects of intracellular lipid metabolism and ATP production in liver and muscle cells may contribute to insulin resistance.[61]  New evidence also points to a role of a brain region called the hypothalamus in the development of insulin resistance. A gene called Dusp8 is linked with an increased risk for diabetes.[62] This gene codes for a protein that regulates neuronal signaling in the hypothalamus. Also, infusions into the hypothalamus of a hormone called leptin normalize blood glucose and diminish insulin resistance in diabetic animals.[63] Activation of hypothalamic cells by leptin has an important role in maintaining normal levels of blood glucose. Thus, both the endocrine cells of the pancreas AND cells in the hypothalamus may have a role in the etiology of type 2 diabetes.
 Hypothalamic cells regulate blood glucose via projections to the autonomic nervous system. Autonomic innervation of liver and muscle cells stimulates an increased uptake of glucose. In diabetic humans, the control of blood glucose by the autonomic nervous system is abnormal.[64] Leptin-sensitive, glucose regulating neurons become resistant to leptin during aging or during exposure to a high-fat diet. These leptin-resistant neurons fail to restrain food intake, obesity, and blood glucose. The reasons for this lowered responsiveness to leptin are uncertain and are part of the puzzle of the causes of type 2 diabetes.[65]
 Blood glucose levels can also be normalized in diabetic rodents by a single intrahypothalamic infusion of Fibroblast Growth Factor 1 (FGF1), an effect that persists for months even in severely diabetic animals. This remarkable cure of diabetes is accomplished by a stimulation of accessory brain cells called astrocytes.[66][67]  Hypothalamic astrocytes that produce Fatty Acid Binding Protein 7 (FABP7) are targets of FGF1; these cells are also in close contact with leptin-sensitive neurons, influence their function, and regulate leptin sensitivity.[68][69] An abnormal function of FABP7+ astrocytes thus may contribute to the resistance to leptin and insulin that appear during aging and during exposure to high-fat diets.
 During aging, FABP7+ astrocytes develop cytoplasmic granules derived from degenerating mitochondria. This mitochondrial degeneration is partly due to the oxidative stress of the heightened amounts of fatty acids that are taken up by these cells and oxidized within mitochondria.[70][71]  A pathological degeneration of mitochondria in these cells may compromise their normal functions and contribute to abnormalities in the control of blood glucose by the hypothalamus.
 The World Health Organization definition of diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) is for a single raised glucose reading with symptoms, otherwise raised values on two occasions, of either:[74]
 A random blood sugar of greater than 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) in association with typical symptoms[23] or a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of ≥ 48 mmol/mol (≥ 6.5 DCCT %) is another method of diagnosing diabetes.[10] In 2009 an International Expert Committee that included representatives of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommended that a threshold of ≥ 48 mmol/mol (≥ 6.5 DCCT %) should be used to diagnose diabetes.[75] This recommendation was adopted by the American Diabetes Association in 2010.[76] Positive tests should be repeated unless the person presents with typical symptoms and blood sugars >11.1 mmol/L (>200 mg/dL).[75]
 Threshold for diagnosis of diabetes is based on the relationship between results of glucose tolerance tests, fasting glucose or HbA1c and complications such as retinal problems.[10] A fasting or random blood sugar is preferred over the glucose tolerance test, as they are more convenient for people.[10] HbA1c has the advantages that fasting is not required and results are more stable but has the disadvantage that the test is more costly than measurement of blood glucose.[78] It is estimated that 20% of people with diabetes in the United States do not realize that they have the disease.[10]
 Type 2 diabetes is characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency.[79] This is in contrast to type 1 diabetes in which there is an absolute insulin deficiency due to destruction of islet cells in the pancreas and gestational diabetes that is a new onset of high blood sugars associated with pregnancy.[13] Type 1 and type 2 diabetes can typically be distinguished based on the presenting circumstances.[75] If the diagnosis is in doubt antibody testing may be useful to confirm type 1 diabetes and C-peptide levels may be useful to confirm type 2 diabetes,[80] with C-peptide levels normal or high in type 2 diabetes, but low in type 1 diabetes.[81]
 Universal screening for diabetes in people without risk factors or symptoms is not recommended.[82][83] Screening is recommended by the World Health Organization, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and the American Diabetes Association for high-risk adults.[84][85][86]  Risk factors considered by the USPSTF include adults over 35 years old who are overweight or have obesity and adults without symptoms whose blood pressure is greater than 135/80 mmHg.[87][needs update][84] For those whose blood pressure is less, the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening.[87][needs update] The American Diabetes Society recommends screening for adults with a body mass index (BMI) over 25.[86] For people of Asian descent, screening is recommended if they have a BMI over 23.[86] Other high risk groups include people with a first degree relative with diabetes; some ethnic groups, including Hispanics, African-Americans, and Native-Americans; a history of gestational diabetes; polycystic ovary syndrome; excess weight; and conditions associated with metabolic syndrome.[23] There is no evidence that screening changes the risk of death and any benefit of screening on adverse effects, incidence of type 2 diabetes, HbA1c or socioeconomic effects are not clear.[83][88]
 In the UK, NICE guidelines suggest taking action to prevent diabetes for people with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more.[89] For people of Black African, African-Caribbean, South Asian and Chinese descent the recommendation to start prevention starts at the BMI of 27,5.[89] A study based on a large sample of people in England suggest even lower BMIs for certain ethnic groups for the start of prevention, for example 24 in South Asian and 21 in Bangladeshi populations.[90][91]
 Onset of type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented through proper nutrition and regular exercise.[92][93] Intensive lifestyle measures may reduce the risk by over half.[26][94] The benefit of exercise occurs regardless of the person's initial weight or subsequent weight loss.[95] High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of diabetes by about 28%.[96] Evidence for the benefit of dietary changes alone, however, is limited,[97] with some evidence for a diet high in green leafy vegetables[98] and some for limiting the intake of sugary drinks.[99] There is an association between higher intake of sugar-sweetened fruit juice and diabetes, but no evidence of an association with 100% fruit juice.[100] A 2019 review found evidence of benefit from dietary fiber.[101]
 In those with impaired glucose tolerance, a 2019 systematic review found moderate-quality evidence that metformin, when compared to diet and exercise or a placebo intervention, appeared to delay or reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.[102] This same review found moderate-quality evidence that when compared to intensive diet and exercise, Metformin did not reduce risk of developing type 2 diabetes, as well as very low-quality evidence that combining metformin with intensive diet and exercise does not appear to have any effect on risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to intensive diet and exercise alone.[102] This systematic review only found one suitable trial comparing metformin with sulphonylurea in reducing risk of type 2 diabetes but it did not report any patient-relevant outcomes.[102]
 A Cochrane systematic review assessed the effect of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in people with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting blood glucose, elevated glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).[103] It was found that acarbose appeared to reduce incidence of diabetes mellitus type 2 when compared to placebo, however there was no conclusive evidence that acarbose compare to diet and exercise, metformin, placebo, no intervention improved all-cause mortality, reduced or increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, serious or non-serious adverse events, non-fatal stroke, congestive heart failure, or non-fatal myocardial infarction.[103] The same review found that there was no conclusive evidence that voglibose compared to diet and exercise or placebo reduced incidence of diabetes mellitus type 2, or any of the other measured outcomes.[103]
 A 2017 review found that, long term, lifestyle changes decreased the risk by 28%, while medication does not reduce risk after withdrawal.[104] While low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetes, correcting the levels by supplementing vitamin D3 does not improve that risk.[105]
 Management of type 2 diabetes focuses on lifestyle interventions, lowering other cardiovascular risk factors, and maintaining blood glucose levels in the normal range.[26] Self-monitoring of blood glucose for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes may be used in combination with education,[106] although the benefit of self-monitoring in those not using multi-dose insulin is questionable.[26] In those who do not want to measure blood levels, measuring urine levels may be done.[107] Managing other cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and microalbuminuria, improves a person's life expectancy.[26] Decreasing the systolic blood pressure to less than 140 mmHg is associated with a lower risk of death and better outcomes.[108] Intensive blood pressure management (less than 130/80 mmHg) as opposed to standard blood pressure management (less than 140-160 mmHg systolic to 85–100 mmHg diastolic) results in a slight decrease in stroke risk but no effect on overall risk of death.[109]
 Intensive blood sugar lowering (HbA1c<6%) as opposed to standard blood sugar lowering (HbA1c of 7–7.9%) does not appear to change mortality.[110][111] The goal of treatment is typically an HbA1c of 7 to 8% or a fasting glucose of less than 7.2 mmol/L (130 mg/dL); however these goals may be changed after professional clinical consultation, taking into account particular risks of hypoglycemia and life expectancy.[86][112][113] Hypoglycemia is associated with adverse outcomes in older people with type 2 diabetes.[114] Despite guidelines recommending that intensive blood sugar control be based on balancing immediate harms with long-term benefits, many people – for example people with a life expectancy of less than nine years who will not benefit, are over-treated.[115]
 It is recommended that all people with type 2 diabetes get regular eye examinations.[13] There is moderate evidence suggesting that treating gum disease by scaling and root planing results in an improvement in blood sugar levels for people with diabetes.[116]
 A proper diet and regular exercise are foundations of diabetic care,[23] with one review indicating that a greater amount of exercise improved outcomes.[117] Regular exercise may improve blood sugar control, decrease body fat content, and decrease blood lipid levels.[118]
 Calorie restriction to promote weight loss is generally recommended.[119][77] Around 80 percent of obese people with type 2 diabetes achieve complete remission with no need for medication if they sustain a weight loss of at least 15 kilograms (33 lb),[120][121] but most patients are not able to achieve or sustain significant weight loss.[122] Even modest weight loss can produce significant improvements in glycemic control and reduce the need for medication.[123]
 Several diets may be effective such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), Mediterranean diet, low-fat diet, or monitored carbohydrate diets such as a low carbohydrate diet.[77][124][125] Other recommendations include emphasizing intake of fruits, vegetables, reduced saturated fat and low-fat dairy products, and with a macronutrient intake tailored to the individual, to distribute calories and carbohydrates throughout the day.[77][126] A 2021 review showed that consumption of tree nuts (walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts) reduced fasting blood glucose in diabetic people.[127] As of 2015[update], there is insufficient data to recommend nonnutritive sweeteners, which may help reduce caloric intake.[128] An elevated intake of microbiota-accessible carbohydrates can help reducing the effects of T2D.[129] Viscous fiber supplements may be useful in those with diabetes.[130]
 Culturally appropriate education may help people with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar levels for up to 24 months.[131] There is not enough evidence to determine if lifestyle interventions affect mortality in those who already have type 2 diabetes.[94]
 Although psychological stress is recognized as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes,[10] the effect of stress management interventions on disease progression are not established.[132] A Cochrane review is under way to assess the effects of mindfulness‐based interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes.[133]
 There are several classes of anti-diabetic medications available. Metformin is generally recommended as a first line treatment as there is some evidence that it decreases mortality;[7][26][134] however, this conclusion is questioned.[135] Metformin should not be used in those with severe kidney or liver problems.[23] The American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend using a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor as the first-line treatment in patients who have or are at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or kidney disease.[136][137] The higher cost of these drugs compared to metformin has limited their use.[122][138][139]
 A second oral agent of another class or insulin may be added if metformin is not sufficient after three months.[112] Other classes of medications include: sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists.[112] A 2018 review found that SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists, but not DPP-4 inhibitors, were associated with lower mortality than placebo or no treatment.[140] Rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, has not been found to improve long-term outcomes even though it improves blood sugar levels.[141] Additionally it is associated with increased rates of heart disease and death.[142]
 Injections of insulin may either be added to oral medication or used alone.[26] Most people do not initially need insulin.[13] When it is used, a long-acting formulation is typically added at night, with oral medications being continued.[23][26] Doses are then increased to effect (blood sugar levels being well controlled).[26] When nightly insulin is insufficient, twice daily insulin may achieve better control.[23] The long acting insulins glargine and detemir are equally safe and effective,[143] and do not appear much better than neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, but as they are significantly more expensive, they are not cost effective as of 2010.[144] In those who are pregnant, insulin is generally the treatment of choice.[23]
 Many international guidelines recommend blood pressure treatment targets that are lower than 140/90 mmHg for people with diabetes.[145] However, there is only limited evidence regarding what the lower targets should be. A 2016 systematic review found potential harm to treating to targets lower than 140 mmHg,[146] and a subsequent review in 2019 found no evidence of additional benefit from blood pressure lowering to between 130–140mmHg, although there was an increased risk of adverse events.[147]
 2015 American Diabetes Association recommendations are that people with diabetes and albuminuria should receive an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system to reduce the risks of progression to end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events, and death.[77] There is some evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are superior to other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system such as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs),[148] or aliskiren in preventing cardiovascular disease.[149] Although a more recent review found similar effects of ACEIs and ARBs on major cardiovascular and renal outcomes.[150] There is no evidence that combining ACEIs and ARBs provides additional benefits.[150]
 The use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease in diabetes is controversial.[77] Aspirin is recommended in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease, however routine use of aspirin has not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes.[151] 2015 American Diabetes Association recommendations for aspirin use (based on expert consensus or clinical experience) are that low-dose aspirin use is reasonable in adults with diabetes who are at intermediate risk of cardiovascular disease (10-year cardiovascular disease risk, 5–10%).[77]
 Vitamin D supplementation to people with type 2 diabetes may improve markers of insulin resistance and HbA1c.[152]
 Sharing their electronic health records with people who have type 2 diabetes helps them to reduce their blood sugar levels. It is a way of helping people understand their own health condition and involving them actively in its management.[153][154]
 Weight loss surgery in those who are obese is an effective measure to treat diabetes.[155] Many are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels with little or no medication following surgery[156] and long-term mortality is decreased.[157] There however is some short-term mortality risk of less than 1% from the surgery.[158] The body mass index cutoffs for when surgery is appropriate are not yet clear.[157] It is recommended that this option be considered in those who are unable to get both their weight and blood sugar under control.[159][160]
 The International Diabetes Federation estimates nearly 537 million people lived with diabetes worldwide in 2021,[161] 90–95% of whom have type 2 diabetes.[162] Diabetes is common both in the developed and the developing world.[10]
 Some ethnic groups such as South Asians, Pacific Islanders, Latinos, and Native Americans are at particularly high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.[23] Type 2 diabetes in normal weight individuals represents 60 to 80 percent of all cases in some Asian countries. The mechanism causing diabetes in non-obese individuals is poorly understood.[163][164][165]
 Rates of diabetes in 1985 were estimated at 30 million, increasing to 135 million in 1995 and 217 million in 2005.[18] This increase is believed to be primarily due to the global population aging, a decrease in exercise, and increasing rates of obesity.[18] Traditionally considered a disease of adults, type 2 diabetes is increasingly diagnosed in children in parallel with rising obesity rates.[10] The five countries with the greatest number of people with diabetes as of 2000 are India having 31.7 million, China 20.8 million, the United States 17.7 million, Indonesia 8.4 million, and Japan 6.8 million.[166] It is recognized as a global epidemic by the World Health Organization.[1]
 Diabetes is one of the first diseases described[21] with an Egyptian manuscript from c. 1500 BCE mentioning ""too great emptying of the urine.""[167][168] The first described cases are believed to be of type 1 diabetes.[167] Indian physicians around the same time identified the disease and classified it as madhumeha or honey urine noting that the urine would attract ants.[167] The term ""diabetes"" or ""to pass through""  was first used in 230 BCE by the Greek Apollonius Memphites.[167] The disease was rare during the time of the Roman empire with Galen commenting that he had only seen two cases during his career.[167]
 Type 1 and type 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the Indian physicians Sushruta and Charaka in 400–500 AD with type 1 associated with youth and type 2 with being overweight.[167] Effective treatment was not developed until the early part of the 20th century when the Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered insulin in 1921 and 1922.[167] This was followed by the development of the long acting NPH insulin in the 1940s.[167]
 In 1916, Elliot Joslin proposed that in people with diabetes, periods of fasting are helpful.[169] Subsequent research has supported this, and weight loss is a first line treatment in type 2 diabetes.[169]
 Researchers developed the Diabetes Severity Score (DISSCO), a tool that might better than the standard blood test at identify if a person's condition is declining.[170][171] It uses a computer algorithm to analyse data from anonymised electronic patient records and produces a score based on 34 indicators.[172][173]

"Type 2 diabetes happens when your body can’t use insulin properly. Without treatment, Type 2 diabetes can cause various health problems, like heart disease, kidney disease and stroke. You can manage this disease by making lifestyle changes, taking medications and seeing your healthcare provider for regular check-ins. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic condition that happens when you have persistently high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). Healthy blood sugar (glucose) levels are 70 to 99 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). If you have undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes, your levels are typically 126 mg/dL or higher. T2D happens because your pancreas doesn’t make enough insulin (a hormone), your body doesn’t use insulin properly, or both. This is different from Type 1 diabetes, which happens when an autoimmune attack on your pancreas results in a total lack of insulin production. Type 2 diabetes is very common. More than 37 million people in the U.S. have diabetes (about 1 in 10 people), and about 90% to 95% of them have T2D. Researchers estimate that T2D affects about 6.3% of the world’s population. T2D most commonly affects adults over 45, but people younger than 45 can have it as well, including children. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Symptoms of Type 2 diabetes tend to develop slowly over time. They can include: People assigned female at birth (AFAB) may experience frequent vaginal yeast infections and/or urinary tract infections (UTIs). If you have these symptoms, it’s important to see your healthcare provider. Simple blood tests can diagnose T2D. The main cause of Type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance. Insulin resistance happens when cells in your muscles, fat and liver don’t respond as they should to insulin. Insulin is a hormone your pancreas makes that’s essential for life and regulating blood sugar levels. If your body isn’t responding to insulin properly, your pancreas has to make more insulin to try to overcome your increasing blood glucose levels (hyperinsulinemia). If your cells become too resistant to insulin and your pancreas can’t make enough insulin to overcome it, it leads to Type 2 diabetes. Several factors can contribute to insulin resistance, including: The cause of T2D is complex, but researchers know that genetics play a strong role. Your lifetime risk of developing T2D is 40% if you have one biological parent with T2D and 70% if both of your biological parents have it. Researchers have identified at least 150 DNA variations linked to the risk of developing T2D — some increase your risk and others decrease it. Some of these variations may directly play a role in insulin resistance and insulin production. Others may increase your risk of T2D by increasing your tendency to have overweight or obesity. These genetic variations likely act together with health and lifestyle factors to influence your overall risk of T2D. You’re more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes if you: As T2D symptoms typically come on slowly, it’s important to see your primary care provider regularly if you’re at risk for the condition. This way, they can do screenings, like a basic metabolic panel (BMP), to check on your blood sugar levels. It’s better to catch T2D earlier rather than later. Advertisement The following blood tests help your healthcare provider diagnose Type 2 diabetes: In some cases, your provider may order an autoantibody blood test to see if you have Type 1 Diabetes instead of T2D. Unlike many health conditions, you mainly manage T2D on your own with medical guidance and support from your healthcare team. This could include your: Your team should also include family members and other important people in your life. Managing T2D can be challenging — you have to make several decisions every day for it. But everything you do to improve your health is worth it. The core features of Type 2 diabetes management include: Regular activity is important for everyone. It’s even more important if you have diabetes. Exercise is good for your health because it: Talk to your provider before starting any exercise program. You may need to take special steps before, during and after physical activity, especially if you take insulin. The general goal is to get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity. Ask your healthcare provider or registered dietitian to recommend a meal plan that’s right for you. What you eat, how much you eat, and when you eat are all important in keeping your blood sugar levels in the range that your healthcare team recommends. The key to eating with Type 2 diabetes is to eat a variety of nutritious foods from all food groups, in the amounts your meal plan outlines. In general, these types of foods can help support healthy blood sugar levels: Monitoring your blood sugar is essential to finding out how well your current treatment plan is working. It gives you information on how to manage diabetes on a daily — and sometimes even hourly — basis. The results of blood sugar monitoring can help you make decisions about food, physical activity and dosing insulin. Several things can affect your blood sugar. You can learn to predict some of these impacts with time and practice, while others are very difficult or impossible to predict. That’s why it’s important to check your blood sugar regularly if your healthcare provider recommends doing so. There are two main ways you can monitor your blood sugar at home if you have diabetes: You may choose either or both methods for a variety of reasons, such as: Your healthcare provider may recommend taking medication, in addition to lifestyle changes, to manage Type 2 diabetes. These include: Advertisement Type 2 diabetes is a chronic (long-term) disease, which means you must manage it for the rest of your life. There’s no cure for T2D. But you can manage it — with lifestyle changes, medication and blood sugar monitoring — in a way that keeps your blood sugar levels in a healthy range. If you stop managing it or undermanage it, your blood sugar levels will go back up. Certain strategies can help lower your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes or delay its onset, including: Unfortunately, some people have such strong genetic risk factors that even lifestyle changes aren’t enough to prevent developing T2D. If you have Type 2 diabetes, your outlook depends on several factors, like: Untreated or undermanaged T2D can lead to a range of health conditions. As your blood touches virtually every part of your body, having undermanaged Type 2 diabetes that results in continuous high blood sugar over a long period of time can damage several areas of your body. Potential complications of Type 2 diabetes include: Cardiovascular disease, including: Eye conditions, including: Additional complications include: Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is a life-threatening complication of Type 2 diabetes. HHS happens when your blood sugar levels are too high for a long period, leading to severe dehydration and confusion. Symptoms of HHS usually come on slowly and can take days or weeks to develop. Symptoms include: HHS is life-threatening and requires immediate medical treatment. If you experience these symptoms, call 911 or your local emergency services number. Type 2 diabetes is a complex condition that requires daily management, effort and planning. Some tips that can help you manage T2D include: You’ll need to have regular appointments with your healthcare team to be sure you’re on track with your T2D management plan. As your body, life and routines change, your management will need to, as well. Your healthcare team can provide new strategies that are unique to your needs. If you develop symptoms of any diabetes complications, be sure to see your provider as soon as possible. A note from Cleveland Clinic Type 2 diabetes involves constant day-to-day care and management. While it’ll likely be very overwhelming at first, over time you’ll get a better grasp on how to manage the condition and how to be in tune with your body. Be sure to see your healthcare team regularly. Managing Type 2 diabetes involves a team effort — you’ll want both medical professionals and friends and family on your side.

"Type 2 diabetes is a chronic medical condition in which the levels of sugar, or glucose, build up in your bloodstream. This happens because your body cannot react to insulin effectively or is unable to produce enough of it.  In May 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that some makers of metformin extended release remove some of their tablets from the U.S. market. This is because an unacceptable level of a probable carcinogen (cancer-causing agent) was found in some extended-release metformin tablets.  As of October 2021, all of the affected medications have been pulled. If you currently take this drug, talk with your doctor. They’ll advise whether you should continue to take your medication or if you need a new prescription. Typically, the hormone insulin helps move glucose from your blood to your cells, where it’s used for energy. But with type 2 diabetes, your body’s cells aren’t able to respond to insulin as well as they should. In later stages of the condition, your body may also not produce enough insulin. Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes can lead to chronically high blood glucose levels, which can cause several symptoms and potentially lead to serious complications. In type 2 diabetes, your body isn’t able to effectively use insulin to bring glucose into your cells. This causes your body to rely on alternative energy sources in your tissues, muscles, and organs. This is a chain reaction that can cause a variety of symptoms. Type 2 diabetes can develop slowly. The symptoms may be mild and easy to dismiss at first. The early symptoms may include: As the disease progresses, the symptoms become more severe and can cause some potentially dangerous complications. If your blood glucose levels have been high for a long time, the complications can include: Insulin is a naturally occurring hormone. Your pancreas produces it and releases it when you eat. Insulin helps transport glucose from your bloodstream to cells throughout your body, where it’s used for energy. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body becomes resistant to insulin. Your body is no longer using the hormone efficiently. This forces your pancreas to work harder to make more insulin. Over time, this can damage cells in your pancreas. Eventually, your pancreas may not be able to produce any insulin. If you don’t produce enough insulin or if your body doesn’t use it efficiently, glucose builds up in your bloodstream. This leaves your body’s cells starved for energy. Doctors don’t know exactly what triggers this series of events. It may have to do with cell dysfunction in the pancreas or with cell signaling and regulation. While lifestyle choices are typically what trigger type 2 diabetes, you may be more likely to be diagnosed with it if: While the definitive trigger of type 2 diabetes is your body’s resistance to insulin, there’s usually a combination of factors that increase your risk of that resistance occurring. Type 2 diabetes can be managed, and in some cases, reversed. Most treatment plans will include checking your blood glucose levels, and your doctor will tell you how often you should do it. The goal is to stay within a specific range. Additional lifestyle changes your doctor will most likely advise to help treat your type 2 diabetes include: Your doctor will explain how to recognize the early symptoms of blood sugar that’s too high or too low and what to do in each situation.  Additionally, working with a dietician can help you learn which foods can help you manage your blood sugar — and which ones might cause it to become unbalanced. Not everyone with type 2 diabetes needs to use insulin. If you do, it’s because your pancreas isn’t making enough insulin on its own, and it’s crucial that you take insulin as directed. There are other prescription medications that may help as well. In some cases, lifestyle changes are enough to keep type 2 diabetes under control. If not, there are several medications that may help. Some of these medications include: Each type of medication listed above can cause side effects. It may take some time for you and your doctor to find the best medication or combination of medications to treat your diabetes. If your blood pressure or cholesterol levels are also not ideal, you may need medications to address those needs as well. If your body is unable to make enough insulin, you may need insulin therapy. You may only need a long-acting injection you can take at night, or you may need to take insulin several times per day.  Learn about medications that can help you manage diabetes. Diet is an important tool to help maintain optimal heart health and blood glucose levels that are within a safe range.  The diet recommended for people with type 2 diabetes is the same diet just about everyone should follow. It boils down to a few key actions: If you’ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, or even if you’re trying to avoid diabetes and manage your weight, there are certain foods and beverages that you should limit if possible. These include: While no one food, enjoyed every so often, should knock you off your healthy path, it’s a good idea to talk with your doctor about dietary restrictions based on your blood sugar levels. Some people may need to monitor their glucose more carefully than others after eating these foods. Being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes does not mean carbs are off the table. Healthy carbohydrates can provide you with energy and fiber. Some options include: Fat is not off the table, either. Instead, it’s about choosing the right types of fat. Foods with heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids include: You can get healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats from a number of foods, including: Talk with your doctor about your personal nutrition goals. They may recommend you connect with a dietician who’s well-versed in optimal diets for diabetes. Together, you can come up with a diet plan that tastes great and suits your lifestyle needs.  While there are some risk factors for type 2 diabetes that are out of your control (like your age and heritage, as mentioned above), there are certain lifestyle choices that can also put you at a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Some of these include: You may also be at increased risk if you’ve had gestational diabetes or prediabetes, two conditions caused by elevated glucose levels.  Whether or not you have prediabetes, you should see your doctor right away if you think you may be experiencing symptoms of diabetes. Your doctor can get a lot of information from blood work. Diagnostic testing may include the following: If you have diabetes, your doctor will provide you with information about how to manage the disease, including: You may need to see an endocrinologist who specializes in the treatment of diabetes. You’ll probably need to visit your doctor more often at first to make sure your treatment plan is working. While you can’t always prevent type 2 diabetes, there are a few lifestyle tweaks can help delay, or even prevent, the onset. This is true even if you have increased risk factors like prediabetes. For many people, type 2 diabetes can be effectively managed. If not properly managed, it can affect virtually all of your organs and lead to serious complications, including: Hypoglycemia can occur when your blood sugar is low. The symptoms can include shakiness, dizziness, and difficulty speaking. You can usually remedy this by having a “quick-fix” food or beverage, like fruit juice, a soft drink, or hard candy. Hyperglycemia can happen when blood sugar is high. It’s typically characterized by frequent urination and increased thirst. Monitoring your blood glucose carefully, and staying active, can help prevent hyperglycemia.  If you have diabetes while you’re pregnant, you’ll need to monitor your condition carefully. Diabetes that’s poorly controlled may: It can also increase your baby’s risk of developing diabetes during their lifetime. Managing type 2 diabetes requires teamwork. You’ll need to work closely with your doctor, but a lot of the results depend on your choices. Your doctor may want to perform periodic blood tests to determine your blood glucose levels. This will help determine how well you’re managing the condition. If you take medication, these tests will help gauge how well it’s working. Your doctor may also recommend a home monitoring system to test your own blood glucose levels between visits. They’ll explain to you how often you should use it and what your target range should be. Because diabetes can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease, your doctor may want to monitor your blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels. If you have symptoms of heart disease, you may need additional tests. These tests may include an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) or a cardiac stress test. It may also be helpful to bring your family into the loop. Educating them about the warning signs of blood glucose levels that are too high or too low will allow them to help in an emergency. Type 2 diabetes in children is a growing issue. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), around 193,000 Americans under age 20 have type 1 or type 2 diabetes.  One 2016 study found that the incidence of type 2 diabetes in youth has increased to about 5,000 new cases per year. Another study from 2017 also showed a significant increase, particularly in minority races and ethnic groups. If your child has been diagnosed with diabetes, their doctor will need to determine if it’s type 1 or type 2 before suggesting a specific treatment. In the same way that lifestyle choices can help adults manage or even reverse their type 2 diabetes diagnosis, you can help lower your child’s risk by encouraging them to eat well and to be physically active every day.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report the following statistics about diabetes in the United States: The ADA reports the following statistics: The World Health Organization (WHO)Trusted Source reports the following statistics: Type 2 diabetes is a condition that’s created when glucose levels build up in your bloodstream. It’s a common condition that’s often triggered by certain lifestyle choices. But the likelihood of a diagnosis can also be increased by genetics, age, and heritage.  Type 2 diabetes can be managed — and even reversed — with certain lifestyle changes. For more severe cases, medication is available. If you’ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, talk with your doctor about developing a treatment plan that works for your lifestyle. Because this condition is so common, there’s a plethora of resources and first-person accounts to help you on your journey towards managing — or breaking free from — type 2 diabetes.

"Williams syndrome is a rare genetic condition characterized by unique physical features, delays in cognitive development and potential cardiovascular problems. Children born with Williams syndrome can have a normal life expectancy but may develop side effects from the condition that can affect their prognosis. Williams syndrome, also known as Williams-Beuren syndrome, is a rare, neurodevelopmental, genetic condition characterized by many symptoms including unique physical features, delayed development, cognitive challenges and cardiovascular abnormalities. Williams syndrome may cause poor growth in childhood, and most adults with the condition are shorter than average. Williams syndrome can also cause endocrine concerns like having too much calcium in your blood and urine, an underactive thyroid and early puberty. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Williams syndrome usually occurs when someone is missing a small piece of chromosome 7. This means that most people with Williams syndrome have not inherited the condition from a parent. People with Williams syndrome have a 50% chance of passing the condition on to their children. Williams syndrome is a rare condition that occurs in an estimated 1 in every 10,000 births in the United States. Advertisement As your child grows, they may face challenges as a result of their diagnosis, but they can reach their full potential with early intervention and treatment. Children may have birth defects involving their heart or blood vessels around it that sometimes need surgery to correct. They will need routine blood and urine tests to keep their kidneys healthy. They often sit and walk a bit later than other children due to loose joints. Often, children with Williams syndrome have strong verbal and communication skills, which could mask delays to their cognitive abilities, which are common in Williams syndrome-like learning numbers and letters, differentiating between real and abstract and their ability to understand the space between objects. Most children with Williams syndrome have an excellent long-term memory but may experience attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A deletion, or missing piece, of a region on chromosome 7 causes Williams syndrome. In our bodies, we have 46 chromosomes total, arranged into 23 pairs. We inherit one copy of a chromosome in each pair from our parents. Within our chromosomes are segments of DNA (genetic information) known as genes. Our genes are our body’s instruction manual that tells it how to form and function. People with Williams syndrome are missing a portion of chromosome 7, which is made up of several genes. Since your genes are an instruction manual to your body, if you're missing chromosomes, your instruction manual is missing a few pages that describe how chromosome 7 should function. The missing pages in your instruction manual cause symptoms of Williams syndrome. Advertisement Williams syndrome may cause symptoms that range in severity. Not all people with Williams syndrome will have the same set of symptoms. Symptoms of Williams syndrome include: Many of the symptoms of Williams syndrome occur in other conditions that are not Williams syndrome and could lead to multiple diagnoses. Symptoms of Williams syndrome can cause delays for children to reach developmental milestones, which are things that your child can do by a certain age. Developmental milestones showcase how your child thinks, learns, speaks, plays, moves and behaves. Williams syndrome can delay milestones including: One of the more serious symptoms of Williams syndrome is cardiovascular disease. The narrowing of various blood vessels near the heart is common during fetal development (stenosis), which can lead to increased blood pressure, arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) and ultimately cardiac failure. Cardiac involvement is often one of the first signs that your child may have Williams syndrome. A symptom of Williams syndrome is unique physical characteristics that are present when your child is born including: The condition is typically diagnosed when your child is a baby or early during childhood. If your healthcare provider suspects your child has Williams syndrome, they will provide a physical examination of your child, followed by a genetic test, which is a blood test that identifies gene differences. Often, your healthcare provider may ask for additional tests to confirm the diagnosis and check the symptoms of the condition. Other tests include: If someone has Williams syndrome based on physical findings and/or a positive genetic test result, your healthcare provider will work with appropriate specialists to help explain the diagnosis to the individual and their family, especially a genetic counselor. Your provider will discuss condition management recommendations based on the diagnosis. Although there is no cure for Williams syndrome, it is important to identify and treat the side effects that can occur with this condition. Treatments and interventions must be based on the unique needs of each individual including: Since Williams syndrome is a genetic condition caused by a chromosome change, not inherited from a parent, there is typically no way to prevent it. If you are planning on becoming pregnant and want to understand the risks of having a child with a genetic condition, talk with your healthcare provider about genetic testing. Williams syndrome cannot be cured, but treatment is available to manage symptoms. It's important to seek a medical evaluation by your healthcare provider to receive a diagnosis, followed by visits to a specialist as needed to address any symptoms or side effects. Most people with Williams syndrome have a normal life expectancy, but some may have a reduced life expectancy due to complications of the disease (such as cardiovascular problems). Oftentimes, people with Williams syndrome will need additional support as they grow into adults. If your child receives a Williams syndrome diagnosis, it's best to offer them as much love and support as you can. They will likely need to schedule regular visits with their healthcare provider and specialists to treat any symptoms of the condition that may arise, especially cardiovascular side effects. Your child might need to enroll in a special education program to address any challenges they might face in the classroom. Be patient with your child as they grow and adapt to the world around them at their own pace. You should visit your child’s healthcare provider if they: If you notice your child shows signs of heart (cardiovascular) disease, visit the emergency room immediately. Symptoms of cardiovascular disease include: A note from Cleveland Clinic Although Williams syndrome is not contagious, your child’s friendly, outgoing personality is infectious. Always provide support to your child, because a new diagnosis can be overwhelming. Some people find that it helps to discuss their questions or concerns with experts, other individuals with Williams syndrome or parents who have children with Williams syndrome.

"Williams syndrome (WS), also Williams–Beuren syndrome (WBS), is a genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body.[2] Facial features frequently include a broad forehead, underdeveloped chin, short nose, and full cheeks.[2] Mild to moderate intellectual disability is observed in people with WS, with particular challenges with visual spatial tasks such as drawing. Verbal skills are relatively unaffected.[2] Many people with WS have an outgoing personality, an openness to engaging with other people, and a happy disposition.[2][4] Medical issues with teeth, heart problems (especially supravalvular aortic stenosis), and periods of high blood calcium are common.[1][2]
 Williams syndrome is caused by a genetic abnormality, specifically a deletion of about 27 genes from the long arm of one of the two chromosome 7s.[2][4] Typically, this occurs as a random event during the formation of the egg or sperm from which a person develops.[2] In a small number of cases, it is inherited from an affected parent in an autosomal dominant manner.[2] The different characteristic features have been linked to the loss of specific genes.[2] The diagnosis is typically suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing.[1]
 Interventions to support people with WS includes special education programs and various types of therapy.[1] Surgery may be done to correct heart problems.[1] Dietary changes or medications may be required for high blood calcium.[1] The syndrome was first described in 1961 by New Zealander John C. P. Williams.[5][6] Williams syndrome affects between one in 20,000 and one in 7,500 people at birth.[4] Life expectancy is less than that of the general population, mostly due to the increased rates of heart disease.[3]
 The most common symptoms of Williams syndrome are heart defects and unusual facial features. Other symptoms include failure to gain weight appropriately in infancy (failure to thrive) and low muscle tone. People with WS tend to have widely spaced teeth, a long philtrum, and a flattened nasal bridge.[8]
 Most people with WS are highly verbal relative to their intelligence, and are often very sociable, having what has been described as a ""cocktail party""-type personality.[9]  People with Williams syndrome hyperfocus on the eyes of others in social engagements.[10]
 People with WS experience many cardiac problems, commonly heart murmurs and the narrowing of major blood vessels, as well as supravalvular aortic stenosis. Other symptoms may include gastrointestinal problems, such as severe or prolonged colic,[11] abdominal pain and diverticulitis, nocturnal enuresis (bed wetting) and urinary difficulties, dental irregularities[12] and defective tooth enamel, and hormone problems, the most common being hypercalcemia.[13] Hypothyroidism has been reported to occur in children, although no proof has been found of it occurring in adults; adults with WS have a higher risk of developing type-2 diabetes, with some cases apparent as young as 21 years old.[14]
 People with WS often have hyperacusia and phonophobia, which resembles noise-induced hearing loss, but this may be due to a malfunctioning auditory nerve.[15][16]  People with WS can also tend to demonstrate a love of music,[6] and they appear significantly more likely to possess absolute pitch.[17] Also, higher prevalences of left-handedness and left-eye dominance seem to occur.[18]
 Ophthalmologic issues are common in WS.  Up to 75% of subjects in some studies have strabismus (ocular misalignment), particularly esotropia,[19] due to inherent subnormal binocular visual function[20]
and cognitive deficits in visuospatial construction.[21] People with WS have problems with visual processing, but this is related to difficulty in dealing with complex spatial relationships rather than depth perception per se.[22]
 Because of missing multiple genes, many effects on the brain are seen, including abnormalities in the cerebellum, right parietal lobe, and left frontal cortical regions.  This pattern is consistent with the visual-spatial disabilities and problems with behavioral timing often seen in WS.[citation needed]
 Frontal-cerebellar pathways, involved in behavioral timing, are often abnormally developed in people with WS, which may be related to their deficits in coordination and execution of fine motor tasks such as drawing and writing. In addition, people with WS often exhibit gross motor difficulties, including trouble walking downstairs,  overactive motor reflexes (hyperreflexia), and hyperactive, involuntary movement of the eyes (nystagmus).[23]
 Williams syndrome is also noteworthy for exhibiting abnormalities in the parietal-dorsal areas of the neocortex, but not the ventral areas. The parietal-dorsal area handles visual processing that supports visual-spatial analysis of the environment, while the ventral is related to semantic recognition of visual stimuli, and the recognition of faces. Thus, people with WS are often able to visually identify and recognize whole objects, and refer to them by name, but struggle with visuospatial construction (seeing an object as being composed of many smaller parts, and recreating it) and orienting themselves in space.[23]
 People with WS are often affable and hyperverbal, demonstrating the decreased inhibition ability that stems from dorsal-frontal deficits.[24] Some studies suggest that the amygdala of a person with Williams syndrome has greater volume than the average person's (though it is smaller than average in childhood).[25]
In general, neuroimaging studies demonstrate that people with WS have diminished amygdala reactivity in response to socially frightening stimuli (such as disapproving faces), but demonstrate hyperreactivity in the amygdala when presented with nonsocial fear stimuli (such as frightening animals).[23] This may partially account for the apparent absence of social inhibition observed in people with the syndrome, as well as the prevalence of anxious symptoms (but see fear for details on the relationship between the amygdala and fear response).[26] Also, some evidence indicates that people with WS exhibit  amygdalal hyperactivity when viewing happy facial expressions.[27] They are talkative and eager to please.[28]
 Increased volume and activation of the left auditory cortex has been observed in people with WS, which has been interpreted as a neural correlation of patients' rhythm propensity and fondness of music. Similar sizes of the auditory cortex have been previously reported only in professional musicians.[29]
 The earliest observable symptoms of WS include low birth weight, failure to thrive, trouble breastfeeding, nocturnal irritability, and gastroesophageal reflux. Facial dysmorphies thought to be characteristic of the syndrome are also present early in development, as are heart murmurs. Research on the development of the syndrome suggests that congenital heart disease is typically present at an early age, often at the infant's first pediatric appointment. Heart problems in infancy often lead to the initial diagnosis of WS.[25]
 Developmental delays are present in most cases of WS, and include delay of language abilities and delayed motor-skill development. People with WS develop language abilities quite late relative to other children, with the child's first word often occurring as late as 3 years of age. Language abilities are often observed to be deficient until adolescence, in terms of semantics, morphology, and phonology, though not in vocabulary.[25]
 Williams syndrome is also marked by a delay in the development of motor skills. Infants with WS develop the ability to lift their heads and sit without support months later than typically developing children. These delays continue into childhood, where patients with WS are delayed in learning to walk.[25] In young children, the observed motor delay is around 5–6 months, though some research suggests that children with WS have a delay in development that becomes more extreme with age.[30] Children with motor delays as a result of WS are particularly behind in the development of coordination, fine motor skills such as writing and drawing, response time, and strength and dexterity of the arms. Impaired motor ability persists (and possibly worsens) as children with WS reach adolescence.[31]
 Adults and adolescents with Williams syndrome typically achieve a below-average height and weight, compared with unaffected populations. As people with WS age, they frequently develop joint limitations and hypertonia, or abnormally increased muscle tone. Hypertension, gastrointestinal problems, and genitourinary symptoms often persist into adulthood, as well as cardiovascular problems. Adults  are typically limited in their ability to live independently or work in competitive employment settings, but this developmental impairment is attributed more to psychological symptoms than physiological problems.[32]
 People with Williams syndrome report higher anxiety levels as well as phobia development, which may be associated with hyperacusis (high sensitivity to certain frequencies of sound).[33] Compared with other children with delays, those with Williams syndrome display a significantly greater number of fears. 35% of these children met the DSM definition of having a phobia as compared with 1–4.3% for those with other types of developmental delays.[34] Williams syndrome is also strongly associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and related psychological symptoms such as poor concentration, hyperactivity, and social disinhibition.[9]
 Furthermore, cognitive abilities (IQs) of people with WMS typically range from mild to moderate levels of intellectual disability.[35] One study of 306 children with Williams syndrome found IQ scores ranging from 40 to 112 with a mean of 69.32 (the mean IQ score of the general population is 100).[36] IQ scores above this range have been reported in people with smaller genetic deletions.[14] In particular, people with Williams syndrome experience challenges in visual-motor skills and visuospatial construction. Most affected people are unable to spatially orient themselves and many experience difficulty when given a task that requires even the most basic visual problem-solving. Many adults with Williams syndrome cannot complete a simple six-piece puzzle designed for young children, for example. These visuospatial deficits may be related to damage to the dorsal cortical pathway for visual processing.[37]
 Despite their physical and cognitive deficits, people with Williams syndrome exhibit impressive social and verbal abilities.  Williams patients can be highly verbal relative to their IQ. When children with Williams syndrome are asked to name an array of animals, they may well list a wild assortment of creatures such as a koala, saber-toothed cat, vulture, unicorn, sea lion, yak, ibex and Brontosaurus, a far greater verbal array than would be expected of children with IQs in the 60s.[38]  Some other strengths that have been associated with Williams syndrome are auditory short-term memory and facial recognition skills. The language used by people with Williams syndrome differs notably from unaffected populations, including people matched for IQ. People with Williams syndrome tend to use speech that is rich in emotional descriptors, high in prosody (exaggerated rhythm and emotional intensity), and features unusual terms and strange idioms.[37]
 Among the hallmark traits of people with Williams syndrome is an apparent lack of social inhibition. Dykens and Rosner (1999) found that 100% of those with Williams syndrome were kind-spirited, 90% sought the company of others, 87% empathize with others' pain, 84% are caring, 83% are unselfish/forgiving, 75% never go unnoticed in a group, and 75% are happy when others do well.[39]  Infants with Williams syndrome make normal and frequent eye contact, and young children with Williams will often approach and hug strangers. People affected by Williams syndrome typically have high empathy, showing relative strength in reading people's eyes to gauge intentions, emotions, and mental states.[40] The level of friendliness observed in people with Williams is often inappropriate for the social setting, however,  and teens and adults with Williams syndrome often experience social isolation, frustration, and loneliness despite their clear desire to connect to other people.[37]
 While these children often come off as happy due to their sociable nature, often there are internal drawbacks to the way they act. 76–86% of these children were reported as believing that they either had few friends or problems with their friends. This is possibly due to the fact that although they are very friendly to strangers and love meeting new people, they may have trouble interacting on a deeper level. 73–93% were reported as unreserved with strangers, 67% highly sensitive to rejection, 65% susceptible to teasing, and the statistic for exploitation and abuse was unavailable.[39][41][42][43][44] There are external problems as well. 91–96% demonstrate inattention, 75% impulsivity, 59–71% hyperactivity, 46–74% tantrums, 32–60% disobedience, and 25–37% fighting and aggressive behavior.[39][41][45]
 In one experiment, a group of children with Williams syndrome showed no signs of racial bias, unlike children without the syndrome. They did show gender bias, however, to a similar degree to children without the syndrome.[46]
 Williams syndrome is a microdeletion syndrome caused by the spontaneous deletion of genetic material from the chromosomal region 7q11.23. This is a heterozygous deletion, which results in haploinsufficient expression of the 25–27 genes in this region.[49][50] CLIP2, ELN, GTF2I, GTF2IRD1, and LIMK1 are among the genes typically deleted. Haploinsufficiency for the ELN gene, which codes for the extracellular matrix protein elastin, is associated with connective-tissue abnormalities and cardiovascular disease (specifically supravalvular aortic stenosis and supravalvular pulmonary stenosis). Elastin insufficiency may also contribute to distinct facies, harsh or hoarse voice, hernias, and bladder diverticula often found in those with Williams syndrome. Haploinsufficiency in LIMK1, GTF2I, GTF2IRD1, and perhaps other genes may help explain the characteristic difficulties with visual–spatial tasks. Additionally, some evidence shows that haploinsufficiency in several of these genes, including CLIP2, may contribute to the unique behavioral characteristics, learning disabilities, and other cognitive difficulties seen in WS.[51]
 According to the Williams Syndrome Association, its diagnosis begins with the recognition of physical symptoms and markers, which is followed by a confirmatory genetic test. The physical signs that often indicate a suspected case of WS include puffiness around the eyes, a long philtrum, and a stellate pattern in the iris. Physiological symptoms that often contribute to a WS diagnosis are cardiovascular problems, particularly aortic or pulmonary stenosis, and feeding disturbance in infants. Developmental delays are often taken as an initial sign of the syndrome, as well.[52]
 If a physician suspects a case of WS, the diagnosis is confirmed using one of two possible genetic tests: Micro-array analysis or the fluorescent in situ hybridization test, which examines chromosome 7 and probes for the existence of two copies of the elastin gene. Since 98-99% of individuals with WS lack half of the 7q11.23 region of chromosome 7, where the elastin gene is located, the presence of only one copy of the gene is a strong sign of WS.[52]  This confirmatory genetic test has been validated in epidemiological studies  and has been demonstrated to be a more effective method of identifying WS than previous methods, which often relied on the presence of cardiovascular problems and facial features (which, while common, are not always present).[53]
 Reliance on facial features to identify WS may cause a misdiagnosis of the condition. Among the more reliable features suggestive of WS are congenital heart disease, periorbital fullness (""puffy"" eyes), and the presence of a long, smooth philtrum. Less reliable signs of the syndrome include anteverted nostrils, a wide mouth, and an elongated neck. Even with significant clinical experience,  reliably identifying Williams syndrome based on facial features alone is difficult.[25]
 This is particularly the case in individuals of non-white backgrounds, where typical WS facial features (such as full lips) are more prevalent. [54]
 No cure for Williams syndrome has been found. Suggested treatments include avoidance of extra calcium and vitamin D, and treating high levels of blood calcium. Blood-vessel narrowing can be a significant health problem and is treated on an individual basis.
Physical therapy is helpful to patients with joint stiffness and low muscle tone. Developmental and speech therapy can also help children and increase the success of their social interactions. Other treatments are based on a patient's particular symptoms.[8]
 The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends annual cardiology evaluations for individuals with WS. Other recommended assessments include ophthalmologic evaluations, an examination for inguinal hernia, objective hearing assessment, blood-pressure measurement, developmental and growth evaluation, orthopedic assessments on joints and muscle tone, and ongoing feeding and dietary assessments to manage constipation and urinary problems.[55]
 Behavioral treatments have been shown to be effective. In regard to social skills, it may be effective to channel their nature by teaching basic skills. Some of these are the appropriate way to approach someone, how and when to socialize in settings such as school or the workplace, and warning of the signs and dangers of exploitation. For phobias, cognitive-behavioral approaches, such as therapy, are the recommended treatments. One of the things to be careful of with this approach is to make sure that the patients' ""charming"" nature does not mask any underlying feelings.[citation needed]
 Perhaps the most effective treatment for those with WS is music. Those affected have shown relative strength in regards to music, albeit only in pitch and rhythm tasks. Not only do they show strength in the field, but also a particular fondness for it. Music may help with the internal and external anxiety with which these people are more likely to be afflicted.[56] Notably, the typical person processes music in the superior temporal and temporal gyri. Those with WS have reduced activation in these areas, but an increase in the right amygdala and cerebellum.[citation needed]
 People affected by WS are supported by multiple organizations, including the Canadian Association for Williams Syndrome and the Williams Syndrome Registry.[57]
 Williams syndrome has historically been estimated to occur in roughly one in every 20,000 live births,[23] but  more recent epidemiological studies have placed the occurrence rate at closer to one in every 7,500 live births, a significantly larger prevalence. As increasing evidence suggests WS is more common than originally noted (about 6% of all genetic cases of developmental disability), researchers have begun to hypothesize a previous underdiagnosis of the syndrome.[58] One suggested factor in the increase in epidemiological prevalence estimates is that a substantial minority of individuals with the genetic markers of WS lack the characteristic facial features or the diminished intelligence considered to be diagnostic of the syndrome, and often are not immediately recognized as having the syndrome.[9][59]
 Williams syndrome was first described by J. C. P. Williams and his colleagues, who wrote in 1961 of four patients with supravalvular aortic stenosis, mental disability, and facial features including a broad forehead, large chin, low-set, ""drooping"" cheeks, widely spaced eyes, and wide-set mouth. A year after this report, German physician A. J. Beuren described three new patients with the same presentation. This led to the syndrome's full original name, Williams-Beuren syndrome, which is still used in some medical publications. From 1964 to 1975, small research reports broadened medical knowledge of this syndrome's cardiovascular problems. Then in 1975, K. Jones and D. Smith produced a large-scale report on numerous patients with WS, ranging in age from infancy to adulthood, and described the behavioral and observable physical symptoms in greater detail than previously recorded.[9]
 The adjective ""elfin"" may have originated to describe the facial features of people with WS; before its scientific cause was understood, people[who?] believed that individuals with the syndrome, who have exceptionally charming and kind personalities, had extraordinary, even magical, powers.[citation needed] This has been proposed to be the origin of the folklore of elves, fairies, and other forms of the 'good people' or 'wee folk' present in English folklore.[60]
 In a review of the symptoms and features of the syndrome, Laskari, Smith, and Graham emphasized that many family members of individuals with WS reject use of terminology such as ""elfin"", as well as descriptions of social symptoms as ""cocktail party syndrome"". Physicians, family members of individuals with WS syndrome, and WS associations alike have called for the curtailment of such terms.[9]
 One notable person with the syndrome is Gabrielle Marion-Rivard, a Canadian actress and singer who won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Actress in 2014 for her performance in the film Gabrielle.[61] Another is Jeremy Vest,[62] member of the How's Your News? team, featured in the US TV series and film of the same name.
